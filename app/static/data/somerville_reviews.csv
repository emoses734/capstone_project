The restaurant itself was adorable decorated with a homely, clean feel.Since this is a vegetarian and vegan restaurant, if you want real cheese with your meal or fake cheese, you have an option. Since we aren't vegan, we opted for real cheese and ordered the following:1.) Mac and cheese fried balls (5 stars) 2.) Bon me pizza (5 stars)3.) Impossible Big Mac Burger with fries (4 stars)4.) Spaghetti Eggplant Parmesan (came with garlic knots) (4 stars)5.) Chocolate Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake (5 stars)The food was really good! The portions were doubled which explains the larger price tag on menu items. When we come here again, we will probably opt to share an entree. The Mac and cheese balls were so delicious and definitely an indulgence. I was impressed at how good the Big Mac was! I thought the accompanying French fries could have used more work though. The pizza was delicious and is a must order if you like veggies and want to try something different. It's tangy and savory. Note that the chocolate cake was not on the menu but since we had seen it on social media, we asked about it and they brought us some. The cake slice was the size of my arm!!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"1,5,"Internet eaters, it is fair to say that this place blew my mind. We were huge fans of the former incarnation, Eat at Jumbo's, and devastated by the change. Then again, I'm a sucker for a Phoenix rising from the ashes of delicious pizza. Jumbos always had great vegetarian/vegan options, so I was interested to see what their menu would be like when it focused completely on those options. The decor is fresh and inviting--hubby and I both loved the flatware and the wooden pieces adorning the brick walls. Every dish that came out evinced gasps of ooh and aah. The food is so pretty! Gorgeous plating and so many colors. We opted to start with the appetizer special, buffalo cauliflower 'wings', as well as housemade Arnold Palmers. The wings were battered and baked and just perfect. I think the Arnold palmers had jasmine or something floral in them. I really enjoyed mine!For our mains, my husband had the Mozambique chorizo and I had the seitan ribs with Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. I can't say enough about how good everything was! We chatted with the owner during our visit, and he shared that everything except the Impossible Burger (tm) is made in house. Incredible! We finished up with the peanut butter chocolate cake, which was a meal in itself. So good. No one would ever guess it was completely vegan. What a special new place!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"2,1,"Hello! So first off I am not one to write reviews or comment on service but I believe that my experience at Sassafras should be spoken about. Just a background about the situation is I am getting married in August of next year and reached out to Grover (the owner) to talk about catering. We had a sit down talk with my fiancÃ©, maid of honor, Grover and his catering manager Christopher. Throughout the process Grover was Â argumentative and not very helpful. Christopher on the other hand was amazing. He is the reason I still wanted to go with them. We made a menu for my wedding and they told me that they could work within my budget. I then waited two months to get a quote from them just to find out it was $600 over my budget when I was reassured it would not be. In the meantime my fiancÃ© and I went there for his birthday dinner and Grover kept telling me that they could take their time with the quote because my wedding was so far away. When I then stated again that I was concerned about the timeline he kept saying we have time and brushed me off. Once I said I would get in touch with Christopher, Grover made it very clear that he is the owner of the business and Christopher was just in an employee. I consider that to be very rude to put down your employees especially the one that helps with his business so much. I facebook messaged Grover (he didn't want to email) and Christopher saying my concern about how they were 600 dollars over budget. I then got no response until a week later when I message them again. In return I got a message from Grover giving me his number saying call me anytime I called you and no answer.... I replied with telling him I did not receive a phone call. He had called me on Facebook messenger because he did not want to look up my phone number to call my phone. Â When I didn't answer fast enough for him he messaged me again stating he will honor his quote (the one way to high) and not willing to try and bring it down, for 30 days starting today and encouraged me to look elsewhere for catering. I responded with how upset I was about the whole situation and how I have been treated and that I will take my business elsewhere. Later that day I received a phone call from Grover yelling at me trying to defend the pricing, also telling me at that price he would be losing money and asked if I think it would be right if he lost money on my wedding, he became so aggressive that I could not speak to him any longer and had to tell him I needed to get off the phone. Very shaken by this encounter I just paused for a minute to take in what had just happened. He then incessantly kept texting me to the point of harassment. I strongly urged him to stop contacting me and said I do not know how you were still in business when you treat customers this way. I am so sorry for the long post but I strongly suggest that you do not deal with such an unprofessional person who is willing to scream at his customer. I would like to say that Christopher was amazing and very professional this post was not made for him it was made to warn anyone that is thinking of going to or catering from Sassafras. It really sucks because their food is amazing and I am not the person to ever write a bad thing especially with a vegan restaurant but I had to let people know of how awful the owner treated me.",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"3,5,"Sassafras is a one of a kind restaurant. I stopped by before their renovations and rebranding to a vegan restaurant, and I can't get over the transformation. It is extremely exciting to watch a restaurant and group of people adapt to change and create something so unique. Their all vegan menu is the best I've seen. Vegan steaks, burgers, fish, fried eggs, and more. 100% vegan and fresh from their kitchen. The dedication they've put into this is extremely exciting for the vegan community and their food is fantastic -- vegan or not, anyone would enjoy I am thrilled to be close to Sassafras and continue to enjoy meals there!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"4,3,Excited by a new vegetarian/vegan restaurant and quickly stopped by. When I entered no staff were to be found and had to knock on the barn door to get someone's attention and when they showed they seemed affronted. Not a great first impression. Asked for a menu and was rather taken aback by their prices. Almost everything in the menu (desserts being the ONLY exception) was between $15-25. Chose not to eat there that evening so I can't review the food itself.,Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,2,"Good concept, poor execution. Famous seitan ribs were dry and had rubbery consistency. You could barely cut it with a knife. Tofu Mozambique was a few slices of tofu on a huge pile of French fries. Very subpar, especially for the price they charge. Customer service was not the best either. There were two available tables, one by the door, another by the window. They sat us by the door and refused to move us when we asked for a window table. I thought restaurant business was all about customer service. Will not come back, would not recommend",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"6,4,"Third time's the charm. Â I had the Big Mac and my boyfriend had the Supreme pizza. Â This time, the pizza was delicious. Â The Big Mac was alright-- about as good as a meat-free Big Mac could be. Â And the cake was delicious again.",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"7,5,"One of the best things about Eat At Jumbo's and now Sassafras are all the ""meat"" options. When looking for vegetarian-friendly meals, you often get stuck with eggplant parmesan or a salad, but not here. You can get a chicken sandwich, chorizo, ribs, Italian sausage, and so much more! Really creative vegan menu (and yes, we checked- it's all fake meat!). Looking forward to watching this new restaurant grow.",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"8,5,"First of all, super awesome menu. Hard to find extensive Vegan/vegetarian choices that taste good, and I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken and waffles was awesome, and my boyfriend had the southern fried chicken and biscuits. We shared a salad and had a cinnamon roll and a double chocolate ganache and Oreo truffle cake made in house for dessert -- dank!!!Definitely going back and telling all my vegan friends about it",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"9,5,Today was my first time here and this place had me lost for words. Not only was their food out of this world amazing but their unique design in the restaurant itself and their chopping board plates doesn't go without notice. They have the friendliest staff I've ever met and their owner is so down to earth. Did I forget to mention how amazing their food is?? Please if you're ever in the area check them out you will not be disappointed!,Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"10,5,Oh man. Been vegan 5 years and have eaten in many places but this has to be amongst the top 3. The place which used to be Eat at Jumbos has been completely redone and is really cute. The service was great. The owner was there and is super nice but now comes the best part. The food was incredible. If he keeps this up it is bound to become a top vegan destination!,Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"11,2,Over priced dessert ($13 for a slice of carrot cake) and unimpressive appetizer. Would not recommend this capitalist vegan place. There are many other restaurants to support.,Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"12,5,"Really great high end style vegan food! A rare find in the Boston area to say the least. We had the sliders, garlic knots, salad, and 'crab' mushrooms caps -- all AMAZING. The server was so nice and we got to sit outside on the sidewalk. Wonderful experience - will be going back!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"13,5,"Had the opportunity to try out some dishes at Sassafras in Somerville today. Â This restaurant will be taking over for Eat at Jumbo's and seems to be a collaboration between Grover (Eat at Jumbos) and Chris (chef behind many of the new menu items). Â The restaurant will be 100% vegetarian with tons of vegan options and is currently working through deciding what will go on the menu. Â We had the opportunity to try the Vegan fish sandwich, Vegan lobster roll, Vegan Mac and cheese and a Vegan chicken cutlet sandwich. Â We are very impressed with the flavors of all of the food we had and especially enjoyed the Vegan fish sandwich. Â It is still TBD what will Â go on the menu when the restaurant fully opens up over the next couple of weeks, but our visit and the redesigned interior had us very excited for what is in store for this spot. Â Eat a Jumbo's was already a gem, but now it will have a new name, tons of new vegan and vegetarian options and it has a significant spruced up interior.",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"14,5,"Sassafras has raised the bar for the Boston vegan/vegetarian food scene. Â Taking comfort food to a whole new level, this spot has created the most innovative plant-based menu around. Â The seitan ribs will easily be the best meal you'll have all year. Â The spaghetti and meatballs would feel at home on any menu in the North End. Â The chick-un prepared any way is fantastic, as are the vast vegan and vegetarian pizza options. Â  The crab stuffed mushrooms aren't to be missed, neither is the chick-un buffalo dip. Â Be sure to save room for some of the most decadent and delicious desserts around Â Five stars isn't enough for Sassafras. Â And yes, this isn't Taco Bell, so don't expect to find a dollar menu. Â But do expect to be amazed, and ready to become a regular.",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"15,5,"Sassafras doesn't just offer vegan options; they offer FANTASTIC #vegan options and quite possibly the best cinnabons money can buy Everything from the quality of the food, to the ambiance, to the service-Sassafras is what the dining out experience is all about!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"16,5,"Amazing. Everything about it was great! The food was so fresh and satisfying. The place was wicked clean, I sat outside and the waitress was just wicked sweet. Will def be back again. I want all the vegan food. Try and sit outside, it's better. :)",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"17,5,"Great vegan menu with lots of variety. If folks know the area, the food is somewhere between veggie galaxy and true bistro in terms of style - it's a bit more on the upscale but still with some comfort classics. We got the pot roast, pepperoni pizza, and the blooming onion. All delicious and really well done. The photos tell the rest of the story!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"18,5,I loved Jumbos but this place is the perfect upgrade for veg food. Only went for bfast so far and was very impressed! There are some cheaper options but mostly 'fancy' brunch options. I loved the spicy chick sandwich and the bagel with 'bacon' and chive vegan spread. Recommend the cold brew and OJ for bevs. I really appreciate that this place offers unique veg dishes - I'm excited to try dinner!,Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"19,5,"Went for a date tonight and had the good luck to be seated next to Grover (owner) who was engaging and informative. Husband had the fish sandwich and I got the buffalo cauliflower gyros, and we split a side of Mac n cheese. First off, portions are HUGE. And second, they taste amazing. Like, tears came to my eyes good. Even husband who is a hardcore carnivore adored it and polished off mine as well as his. All the staff was attentive and prompt with their responses. We were full but got dessert anyway. The nutterbutter chocolate cake is the stuff of dreams. Enough to feed at least 4 people, it's going to keep me happy for days. Simple and comfortable decor, loved the wooden cutting boards they use for serving. Make this your next meal out for sure!!!!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"20,5,Awesome Greek restaurant in Assembly Row which offers two dining experiences.... counter service or table service. Â The table service offers up a greater selection of food choices and alcoholic beverages.Came for a quick business lunch and ordered counter service. I ordered the kale salad with chicken and side cup of lamb chili. They were both excellent. Â The salad was made fresh to order and was presented in a huge bowl. The lamb chili was full flavored and loaded with chopped lamb meat. I would order both again.My colleague ordered a Gyro and said that it was the best he has ever had! Â Great addition to Assembly Row.Will definitely be back!,Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"21,4,"A surprising delicious find! My friends and I came on a random weekday night for dinner and between the 3 of us - shared the Olympian platter and were happily stuffed! The platter came with a mixture of lamb chops, chicken wings, kebabs, sausages, fries, Spanakopita, pita, and a cheesy spread! Everything was beautifully, artfully marinated and quality was top notch. My fave was definitely the lamb chops, and the next time I'm Â back I know I'm gonna go straight for the gold and only order the chops! The only thing I would've been happy to forgo would be the sausages. They simply paled in comparison to the other delicious meats! Drop by for a tasty, meaty meal!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"22,5,"Yes yes yes. As if there weren't already enough amazing restaurants in my area, I can now add Zo Greek to the list. I like that you can choose what kind of dining experience you want upon walking in. We stayed to the right near the dining and bar area which offers a larger menu and a slightly more formal experience.The waitress was an angel and let me try a couple of wines before I ordered. To start we had the spread sampler, the star of which was the Tzatziki. It was thick and creamy and served with yummy warm pita. In fact, the pita was so good that we decided against our original choice of ordering different meat skewers for dinner, and just went with Pork gyros. They were DELICIOUS and huge. I only ate half of mine and took the rest home. The fries that they were served with were also some of the most slammin' fries i've ever had. Think steak fries, but crispier and more delicious on that outside than your average. We'll definitely be back here!!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"23,5,"Opa! We had a 5-star-worthy Greek culinary experience at Zo on Saturday night.Upon entering, you are immediately tasked with a decision: veer left for the casual menu (pitas, rice bowls, etc) or turn right for the sit-down restaurant experience with extended menu.I want allll the options, so we go right and sit ourselves down. Our waitress soon comes over to hand us menus and explains that the meze plates all vary in size, so we can order a few to share. Also, for +$8 you can turn a meze into a dinner plate with salad + fries/rice. Good to know!After looking over all the options, we went for the dolmadakia (stuffed grape leaves), pastitsio (kind of like a Greek lasagna), and the locanico (Greek sausage) dinner plate.Our friendly waitress asked how we'd like the food to come out, and we said just as it's ready. So first to arrive were the dolmadakia. These were presented beautifully with a fresh lemon slice on top of the 4 grape leaf-wrapped rice bundles. The pool of olive oil they were bathing in was so delicious. The rice mixture had great herbs/spices, and the entire thing had a slight lemony flavor which was outstanding. These were happily devoured.The pastitsio came next, which is two pasta layers encasing ground beef a la lasagna. This creamy, hearty dish is the epitome of comfort food. The portion was quite big for a ""meze"" and the meat was spiced wonderfully. It's the kind of food you can't help but dig into.The locanico dinner with salad and fries was a great portion. The sausage had nice flavor, a bit smoky and charred and perfectly seasoned. The fries came out crispy & hot, and it was nice to have the Greek salad with feta, olive, cucumber, and tomato to balance things out.We left feeling full but still energized, not gross as you would typically feel after a large meal. And before we even left, we talked about returning to try more dishes and desserts. The Mediterranean diet is one of the best for you, and now I can see why -- you feel great and are also a happier person!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"24,5,"ZO IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE GREEK FOOD IN MASSACHUSETTS! when I used to work in the financial district I would eat at Zo on state street and in government center every single week. I am so happy the opened a location at Assembly row.I really recommend their salads, rice plates, gyros, soups, spinach pie, and desserts. EVERYTHING from here is AMAZING. The customer service is always top notch. All the employees are always so friendly, nice, efficient, and very professional. This location also have a bar service with a special menu. All around 5 stars!!!! Best food, service, staff and drinks.",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"25,5,"Had a great experience at Zo. The place is very nice with beautiful windows (like the rest of assembly). Gf ordered a margarita that was surprisingly good. The chicken and pork gyros were both good, but the chicken was definitely the Â best. Super moist and flavorful. The price was extremely reasonable with portions big enough that neither of us could finish. Also our waitress was very sweet and attentive.",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"26,5,"Ok where do I begin!? We stopped in about a month ago for lunch (soup and gyros) and fell in love. Â I had the fasolada and she had the lentil. Â Since then we have returned numerous times on Sunday nights. Â We've had the Olympian (a plate filled with grilled meats and heaven) as well as Â the spanakopita and baklava cheesecake. Â The food is so fresh, flavorful and delicious but it's the atmosphere that has us sold. Â Coming from an Italian family, Sunday dinner is everything. Sadly time goes on and traditions change but this place has filled a void for me and my girlfriend. Â The family vibe, the friendly faces and conversation from owners and staff only elevate the quality of food. Â Did I mention the authentic Greek wines, beer, and cocktails? Tonight we left knowing that we have a new place for ""family dinner"" on Sundays. Thank you Zo! We love you!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"27,4,Awesome! I didn't know there's a bar area on the side. I got a chicken gyro and lentil soup.

I will be coming back to try some other stuff on the menu.,Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"28,5,"YUM! I really didn't expect to like this place. The lines for Sunday brunch in Assembly Row were long, so we decided to just pop into Zo to eat. We got the pork gyro plate, chicken gyro, and a kale salad. The portions were generous. The pita was so soft, hot and delicious. The gyro plate came with crunchy potato wedges. My boyfriend loved them! The kale salad wasn't a normal boring salad. I loved the thinly sliced fennel, roasted sweet potatoes, and apple. It had a good balance of crunch and flavor. The waiter was really attentive and nice. I want to come back to try the zucchini fritters!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"29,5,"These guys are great. Â A friendly welcome, great food, great prices and a good little bar. I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch recently and had not tried this new location. Â  It was nice and clean and the service was quick and friendly. For food, I got the Chicken Gyro and the Lamb Chili. Â  The Gyro was full of chicken, moist, the pita was fresh and all of the vegetables were very fresh and flavorful. Â  The lamb chili was the perfect amount of spice and full of meat.

We went to check it out this past weekend before running some errands in Assembly. One thing to note is that during lunch it's mostly a take out spot. They do have seats and the restaurant itself is nice, but the bar and the bigger food menu isn't available until 3, which I wasn't aware of. We were starving so each got a gyro (pork for me and chicken for him), plus stuffed cabbage and tomato soup. Everything was wonderful and very reasonably priced. The stuffed cabbage came topped with a lemony sauce; they might have been my favorite part of the meal. So simple yet such comfort food. My pork gyro was glorious. Decadent yet didn't make me feel unhealthy eating it. Everything was so fresh. The portion was also huge! I couldn't finish my gyro! I definitely want to check it out again at night when we can hopefully sit at the bar and order more of their dinner offerings!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"31,4,"Authentic and quaint restaurant nestled in Assembly Row. Â  It is located on the newer side over near Fit Row. I got the chicken gyro and it was delish! I was missing feta and fries, some places do that and I love it.

The price was pretty reasonable; the food came in about 10-15, was steaming hot, and DELICIOUS. I ordered a bowl of the assembly fried rice, and sampled their spicy beef udon and edamame.

I'd hands down recommend getting a bento box. The salmon teriyaki bento box is my favorite! The portion is generous, and you get a great selection of options from their menu. I found that it was a great way to sample items to pick what you want to eat the next time. All their rolls are made fresh, and the sushi is created perfectly. Don't forget to request some sake to sip on as you eat your meal.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"44,4,"My husband and I enjoyed our dinner here on a Monday night. It was a quiet night and although we made reservations, we could have picked where to sit because there were maybe 3 other small parties of people there. I ordered an udon soup that came with tempura. It was really delicious and comforting especially on the cold evening (mind you, I live in Hawaii). I was surprised how filling and big the portion was considering it was one of the cheapest things on the menu. The soup had vegetables (yummy mushrooms) and the plate of tempura had shrimp and various vegetables. I walked out as a content customer and felt warm!My husband got a tuna sashimi dish which was also good. He ordered a unique sauce with French onions and spicy mayo to go for it. It was ok and not typical of Japanese dishes.

(I had my 6 month old with me & she wanted to sit with Mom - which slows my ability to eat.)I'll definitely be back when I'm at Assembly Row again.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"46,4,My family and I ordered dinner from this restaurant:We ordered:* salmon sashimi* seared salmon sushi* spicy salmon roll* caterpillar roll* stir fry beef udon* sunset maki* pan fried dumplings* lobster rangoons* spicy chicken slivers* assembly fried riceThe sushi and sashimi was fresh. I liked the spicy salmon and seared salmon sushi. The stir fried beef udon was good as well.,Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"47,4,"This place is clean and modern looking. The price is your typical high end sushi place. Although it's odd. It's a fusion of Japanese and Chinese. The hokkai yaki was yummy but it doesn't look appetizing. However, don't judge a book by its cover. It was spicy and soft and salty and just yummy. It looks more like a spicy pancake/crepe than scallops but its good. The toro nigiri was fantastic. It was fatty and i love the presentation to include gold flakes. The seared maguro was yummy as well. Bruins roll was delicious. I'd order that again in a heartbeat.Def willing to come back and try the chinese food dishes. The menu looked Â delish as well.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"48,4,"We love coming here for sushi! Every sushi place I have been to gets your food out quickly, but this place is the quickest! The spicy tuna and space salmon rolls are our favorite! They have really perfected those rolls Â the only comment I can make about why I didn't give them 5/5 stars is that their rolls are small in size when comparing to other sushi places.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"49,4,"I came here here on a Tuesday evening and was seated immediately. Our server was friendly but she was not very attentive, we had to ask her to refill water and tea. FYI, the hot tea is not free like in some restaurants, it costs 1.50 per cup! The husband and I decided to share 3 sushi rolls between us, so we ordered: Rowing down the mystic - get this if you like salmon! The spicy mayo taste is quite strong, you might not like this if you don't like mayo.Dragon - this is pretty common in sushi restaurant. Fried tempura with avocado and eel. Can't go wrong with this! Note that this comes in 4 giant pieces instead of 6 or 8 like other rolls Spicy scallop - this was hands down my favorite roll. The fried scallop and tobiko on top of the rolls gave it a nice crunch and texture compared to the other rolls. When you first put it into your mouth you will first taste the spicy mayo on the top, and when you bite into it you can taste the sweetness of the eel sauce inside. Overall the sushi was pretty good Americanized sushi. It might be my ordering choice, but they all seemed quite heavy on the mayo, it was definitely a very rich meal.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"50,4,"I love this place! The sushi is always fresh and made to order, and the decor inside just adds to the experience.Their sweet crispy chili wings are so good! Perfectly crispy with a delicious sweet chili glaze. I only wish they had an option for this as an entree so that I could order more as a meal!I also ordered the lobster Rangoon. I really like their take on this because it's not too overpowered by the filling and it's not too oily like some other rangoons that other establishments make.The scorpion maki was surprisingly very good! I don't normally go for sushi with eel but all the flavors worked well together.The staff here is very nice, and actually engage in conversation with people, which is always a plus. (Especially when you wander in alone after running errands) I will be back !They didn't have duck sauce when I was there, but the bartender made due by offering me some of their other sauces. I didn't know they made theirs fresh, so bonus points for that!",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"51,1,I ordered the rib eye teriyaki to go. Medium well.

And waste $28!,Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"52,4,"We came here for a bite to eat after shopping, looking for good food but something softer on the wallet. Fuji was the perfect place for this!The atmosphere took me by surprise - it's pleasantly spacious with a beautiful open sushi counter and high ceilings. We started off with a complimentary chef's tasting, which was a torched salmon nigiri with eel sauce -- delicious. For appetizer, we had the salmon with wonton crisps. I loved this modern take on nachos! Highly recommend this dish. We had the Sushi deluxe combo rolls, with the scorpion roll and rainbow rolls being my favorite. They have a nice proportion of fish to rice and everything is so fresh that it melts in your mouth. Would definitely return again!!",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"53,3,"Currently the best choice for food in the Assembly Row area IMO. Fancy Asian fusion cuisine isn't my thing but this place is convenient when heading over to AMC for a movie. Took 5-10 min to get seated even tho the restaurant had plenty of seating; front desk wasn't super efficient but it's passable. The food here is consistent and not bad quality--I've had the hot & sour soup and salmon bowl. Both were good but nothing outstanding. The presentation was great but the soup was lacking any sour flavor. The salmon was fresh and the sushi rice on spot on tho. However, I still definitely prefer All Seasons to this place in terms of quality and flavor, especially when they are similar in terms of pricing. All in all, you'll have a good meal here if you're at Assembly, but I wouldn't come here if I weren't already in the area.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"54,5,"Our family was basically floored with amazing consideration and service today at Fuji. Â It was 10 of us, and when first group arrived, we weren't thrilled with the positioning of the table for the group. Â We asked the manager for a possibility of creating a more intimate atmosphere with repositioning the table (and, hence, the whole party area), and the manager,Sabrina, went above and beyond with accommodating our suggestions. Â Nowadays we are so used to the Â lack of flexibility in restaurants, this was an amazing surprise. Â  It allowed our BD celebration to really flourish the way we hoped it would, with restaurant team on board. Â The service - Ariel - was also amazing, and food, of course, has been its usual perfect. Â So our greatest thanks and much appreciation for open-mindedness and true welcoming its patrons.

Maybe it was that particular night but it felt empty. The setup gave me teriyaki House (restaurant on boylston) vibes which I didn't care for. The food here is good, I ordered the gyoza and sake teriyaki salmon.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"56,4,"Came here at 1 pm on a Sunday, this place is not that crowded, there's a wave of people coming in and out all the time. The waitress is really nice, quiet attentive to my table except she overlooks the tea sometimes and we have to keep asking for a refill. Over all, the service is satisfactory. They give really good recommendations for the menu. As for the food, we ordered 3 things. One thing to note is that the fish is ""very fresh"". I would say that it's worth the price (yeah, it's quiet pricy). There are a few good lunch menu selections if you are interested. 1) seaweed salad: although it is 6 dollars, they give a generous amount. We could barely finish it (2 of us). It comes with the yellow radish on top, too. But if you ask if there's anything special, not really. (7/10) 2) chirashi: came with 12 pieces of sashimi (toro, salmon, hamachi, and one fish I have no idea what it is.. gonna assume it's white tuna). The fish is really fresh, really satisfied with this. However, the rice is quiet sour, too much vinegar for me. The quality of the Japanese rice is great though, only improvement would be less vinegar. I'm a huge rice person... so the rice makes a big difference .(8/10)3) mings mango maki: this mango maki is reaaally good. I was craving for some good mango maki and this hit the point. Although I would prefer oishii's mango maki over this because it's not as spicy, this satisfied my cravings. It came with toro on top with some spicy sauce, the inside was filled with cucumber and mango. It's a good mixture of ingredients, ide suggest anyone to try this. (9/10) Over all it was a great experience. The ambience is alright, the music playing were old school party songs like aviicii's song and diamonds by Rihanna, I find it a bit too loud. The song didn't really suit the restaurant. Anyway - if you drop by assembly square for some shopping, drop by.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"57,5,Their calamari is SO GOOD. Â Make sure you start out with this! Â We also tried the watermelon drink that comes inside a watermelon and I can't wait to come back and have it again.

Therefore, it is NOT an authentic Japanese restaurant, its more like an Asian restaurant.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"59,3,"Good but over priced. Went for dinner and we went early so there wasn't a wait. We ordered the Chirashi, spicy salmon maki roll, dynamite maki roll and miso soup. The miso soup was good but very salty. The Chirashi was good but rice was not. The two rolls were good but the dynamite maki is way overpriced ($16). I was surprised to not see any real sushi handrolls on the menu, all they had were vegetarian options for handrolls which were also quite pricey for rice, seaweed, and your choice of avocado and cucumber like ingredients. The food itself is good, there isn't too much rice on the rolls and it is a good balance of fish to rice. The restaurant itself was open and clean with a good dining ambiance. Customer service was fine, nothing terrible or exceptional. Overall, I don't think it's worth the $.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"60,5,"This is definitely one of my all time favorite Thai places! I've been here quite a few times and the food is always excellent. It's a pretty casual place with really great prices and a wide selection of options for all your Thai food needs and cravings.The food - there are three dishes which I think are definitely the highlights. The Tom yum fried rice is extremely tasty. It's definitely a little spicy but nothing crazy and all the flavors of the Tom yum really come through. The pad see ew is another incredible dish - it's not too sweet and every noodle has flavor! I recommend getting it with tofu as the tofu soaks up even more of the sauce and flavor. Last but definitely not least in the highlights is he massamam curry. I wish it came with a bit more sauce and it were a bit more thick but all the flavors are there and the veggies are really well cooked. If you want some appetizers I love their scallion pancakes. The Thai iced tea is also good, a bit too sweet but definitely not the sweetest I've had. Their sticky rice mango is also the best I've had in the area with the mango being perfectly ripe and the coconut really coming through in the rice. The place is really small and the only times there really haven't been people is during a weekday in the mid afternoon. Take out is also a great option for this place and it usually doesn't take long at all. You can order take out through their website, call, through ubereats and probably some other delivery companies. The people are really nice, very attentive, and the service Â is pretty quick. A really must have for Thai food in the area!!",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"61,4,"TBH, I could not eat at Thai restaurants in Boston after returning from my Thailand trip. However, this is one of the better Thai eateries in the Boston area. Obviously it isn't as delicious as the food I had during my trip, but here, at least the flavors remind me of Thailand, which is more than what I can say about other Thai restaurants. Crispy pork rice plate is very good, and he swears by the Boat Noodle Soup. For takeout, I would avoid the flat noodles because they tend to overcook and fall apart. Papaya salad very spicy, like I had in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. It's mostly a takeout place but there are a few tables. Considering how tiny this place is, the menu is extensive and there's something for everyone. The prices are very reasonable. If you order online, there's a discount! Plus they package your order very carefully, with cardboard in between each container so the plastic/aluminum doesn't squish.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"62,2,"Was excited to try after reading rave reviews, but the food was hugely disappointing. I ordered Beef Pad Thai and did so because it's hard to mess up Pad Thai. Â It was very bland, too sweet, and flavorless... there was also no charred color from the wok on the noodles. Â The only plus sides are huge portions and cheap price... but I'd think Davis Square has much better options. Â It's a tiny place, 3-4 tables.. I think most people order takeout.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"63,5,Very good Thai food. Tried two of the chef specials- garlic rice and chicken was delicious- gingery and with a tangy spicy sauce.

Both were super good.,Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"64,4,"Exactly what we need more of in the Boston area. It's not fancy and it might not be the best ever, but it is simple, affordable, and unique. Â For such a small place the menu is surprisingly extensive. Their most interesting dishes though are probably their rice plates that come with a protein, Chinese sausage, and a fried egg. Their signature dish Khao Na Kai Â was satisfying and had a very comforting homemade taste. The Kor Tor Mor noodle Soup with clear broth, roast pork, fish balls, and wonton was also simple comfort food. The place is small. It only has 3 tables so I suspect that take-out will be a popular option. Great for lunch or a quick weekday dinner.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"65,5,"Kor tor mor is the best thai food i have had in boston. There are always people here no matter the time of day and I totally understand it. I would live in this place if I could. The papaya salad is so good- fresh, spicy, tangy. I also recommend the pad kua kai - the noodles are perfectly cooked and spiced, the chicken and squid cooked tender (drizzle a little bit of the leftover sauce from the papaya salad and it is to die for). I recommend coming with friends and sharing so you cab try everything. Be adventurous - go beyond the classic pad thai or drunken noodles and you will not regret.The service is great here- wait staff are super fast and so is take out if you would rather bring home.

Â I have not experienced the terrior of Bangkok at night, and have never taken advantage of the Baht to USD conversion rates. Â From this viewpoint, I think they do some rock solid food here. In a city like Somerville, it feels as if every square needs to have a solid Thai food option. Â When i went to school in Davis, CA, there were 6 Thai restaurants within one square mile! Â Having said that, this place has the usual dishes, but it also has dishes I have never seen or heard of before. Â The one plate I had, what could amount to a rice plate with pork three ways, roasted, fried, and in sausage form, was amazingly good. It was coated with a red sauce, not too sweet and not too sour, but just enough of both to compliment the dish.Their Thai Iced Tea is on point, the fried tofu with the peanut sauce was good, and their tom yum hit the spot. The price point is reasonable, and their dining space was clean and well-lit. Â They only have four tables so dining in could be an issue with larger groups. Â They also have a pretty robust take-out game going on which it seemed lots of people were taking advantage of. Â Last but note least, the customer service was five stars. Â I found the Thai Iced Tea I had to be a little too sweet, they adjusted it for me without question.

I got the Kana Moo Grob -- pork belly stir-friend with Chinese broccoli. The pork belly is shared with another dish -- Kapow Moo Grob. Perhaps because of that, the meat was pre- and over-cooked, and when stir-fried again, it came out really tough. I don't mind my pork belly dry, but I had trouble chewing through it to finish the meal.They closed a bit early. When we left, the employees were eating before cleaning up. I swear one of their bowls had some fresher pieces of pork belly. They must have seen me staring longingly on their security cam, as they called out from the back room when no one was in the front of the house.I want this place to succeed, but it's gonna need more fresh cooking.I see another negative review for pork belly, so maybe they need to focus on it, as it makes up 14% of the street food section of their menu.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"69,5,Takeout pad Thai with amazing pad Thai noodles and huge serving yum!!

Definitely looks like a place you would want to try, but mainly as a takeout spot.Service: average, they ran out of the item ordered online and informed me only during pick-up.Food: HUGE disappointment. I ordered very generic dishes to try it out. Pad Thai - lacks flavor, noodles seemed overcooked, chicken was dry, overall it felt like something was missing from the dish. Fried Rice with pork belly - fried rice with fried pork belly on top (clarification, didn't specify on the menu), also very bland. The pork belly was tough and the fried batter tasted very soggy.

Khao na ped - awesome, really tender duck with a yummy sauce. Definitely share it if you want a variety - i probably wouldn't have ordered this as my only dish. 4. scallion pancake - we got this with the coupon. Pleasantly surprised, the dough was flakier than many other places which i love. And served with a nice sweet ginger-y sauce.Lows:1. the pad thai with crispy chicken.

The good: The food tasted very fresh and the presentation was nice. I would consider this the lighter version of Thai food as it was not as greasy as other places I've been to. The restaurant is very clean and cozy and the owner is nice. The improvement opportunities:The food lacked flavor. I don't know if it was the dishes that I ordered but I felt like they were missing something. The B1 was a chicken and rice dish with a fried egg. The egg was cooked perfectly with no traces of oil. However, it just tasted like a normal sauteed chicken with rice dish. The B3 was a rice plate with 3 types of meat. Again it was lackluster and not memorable.

This place is so authentic and really felt like a good BBQ joint. This place has been running for 30 years and I love all the vintage images posted around. There are 3 portions of this restaurant. There's the dining area, the bar area, and the downstairs lounge area. They also have nights where they play blues music on certain nights.My friend and I shared the Barbecue Belt and the Fried Chicken Dinner. The Barbecue Belt consists of: 2 St. Louis ribs, 1 Texas style ribs, 2 baby back ribs, beef brisket, and 1 sausage. My favorite from the belt was the St. Louis ribs because it didn't even need sauce. With the Barbecue Belt came with 2 sides and we got collard greens and mac and cheese. Both sides were great. Fried Chicken Dinner came with 2 pieces of fried chicken, boneless, mashed potatoes, fried okra, 2 biscuits, butter and peach jam. Everything on this plate was absolutely amazing. We also got their beignets. It comes fresh in a white paper bag with 4 small ones and it is SO GOOD.The service was very good and the food came out reaaaallly quick. I am absolutely thrilled about this place and I will definitely come back. If you're craving some good BBQ, do yourself a favor and try this place!",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"92,5,"Fall off the bone meat, collard greens, and creamy mac and cheese. The hospitality is though the roof, the music is classic and amazing. And! they are community oriented doing a fundraiser right now to help support the homeless community. My type of place.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"93,5,"This is one of my favorite places to eat and my husband and I have been here multiple times. My favorites are the pulled pork, bbq hash and the fried chicken sandwich(LOVE the fries that come with). The sides are all great, and their draft selection is impressive. We always get their pecan pie and it is always excellent. The last time we went there I got the Texas sheet cake which was mediocre. We just went here two weeks ago and have already decided to go back and try the unlimited hot chicken!",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"94,5,"Great service, great drinks, great bbq. My husband and I went on a Saturday night at 5:00. Plenty of seating at that time. Service was really quick. I got the jalapeÃ±o margarita (so good - super hot and spicy). My husband loved the beer selection and he ordered the sip of sunshine. We both got pulled pork sandwiches - large portions, super moist pork, great sweet bbq sauce. I ordered the onion rings as one of my sides - best onion rings I've ever had. Fried to perfection. We also loved the bbq baked beans. For two people our meal including tip came to just over $60. Well worth it. Definitely going back! The one thing I'd change is the coleslaw that came on the side with the sandwich. I prefer a more vinegary slaw but besides that small detail everything was perfect.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"95,4,"This is a review of my last experience there this weekend with a large group of 8. Â While the food is fine, probably 3 stars - nothing to go nuts over, but good - the service, considering our large group size and it being a busy Saturday night, was great. Â We made a reservation for 7:15, and despite the place being packed, we were actually sat only about 10/15 min. later which was a pleasant surprise (lots of restaurants would botch this!). They have 2 bars to wait at too, but we were honestly too big to be able to really bother. Â  The waitress was patient and attentive too.I thought their $13 dinner special as really reasonable as well - 1 main & 2 hefty sides - and plenty of food! Â Beer list is really good as well - I'd go back just because of that alone. Â I'd recommend sitting downstairs too - Calmer vibe and felt less chaotic than upstairs - if you have a choice.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"96,4,"Redbones is a classic Somerville spot. Of course the Boston area isn't know for its BBQ, but Redbones will prove the stereotypes wrong! The ambiance is VERY casual, and almost too divey in my opinion. It's definitely got a family feel (loud and energetic) with some eclectic decorations and checkered tablecloths, but I think it could use a facelift. Great beer menu to go with your BBQ!! We got the smoked beef brisket sandwich and it was AMAZING!! The meat was so tender and it came with two sides- I recommend both the mac & cheese and the onion rings! They didn't have that many sauces to pick from which really didn't appeal to me as I feel like the BBQ sauce options make all the difference (especially when compared to Sheds BBQ in downtown boston). Overall, definitely recommend as a Davis Square must-visit!",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"97,4,"Fantastic draught list! In addition to beers, lots of great local ciders on tap. One of the highlights of the evening. I had the Downeast Roasted Joe (coffee & bourbon infused cider - amazing!) and my husband got the Ballast Point Orange Vanilla Fathom (incredible!) My husband ordered the pulled pork dinner with dirty rice and baked beans. Everything was on point.I ordered the smoked sausage with cornbread and french fries. The sausage was super spicy. I'm personally a fan of everything spicy, but if you're not expecting it, it might be a surprise for something. Overall delicious. The french fries were nothing special and the weakest link out of everything, but the cornbread was out of this world.The ambiance is very casual. The service was friendly, but not necessarily a focus. If you're not a high maintenance person who likes to enjoy yummy barbecue comfort food in a casual environment, then this is the place for you.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"98,4,"The meat was on the dry/burnt side but I like it that way. The sides were touch and go. Biscuits were hard and unremarkable but the peach jam was tastey. Dirty rice was also dry, but had a good flavor. Greens and fried okra were pretty standard. Service was great. Bottom line, this is probably the best barbecue I would expect from Boston.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"99,5,"I hadn't been to Redbones in a long time. Â Probably 2-3 years. Â I used to go all the time. Â So it was nice to be back.Had the pulled pork sandwich platter and a Stone IPA. Â Chose the cole slaw and the bar-b-q baked beans. Â Sat at the bar.I have to say it was one of the better meals I have had there. Â The cole slaw was really fresh. Â The baked beans were good, not great. Â The generous helping of pork was much appreciated, and I ate it with an assortment of sauces.The key with this place is to go with an open mind. Â It's pretty divey, but in a really good way. Â Lots of great art and decorations. Â It even has one of Tyler Hamilton's jerseys from when he was on Team CSC. Â So if you're a cyclist, you'll get a dose of cycling memorabilia.I think they do beef brisket very well. Â And the pulled chicken is excellent. Â Can't remember about the ribs. Â It isn't the best bar-b-q you've ever had, but it's pretty good. Hush puppies are average.A good experience, and well worth the visit.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"100,5,"I absolutely loved Alden! For over three years, I have been trying to get here in time for the burger. I failed four times. I finally did it tonight, and I'm so proud of myself. :). The burger is rated on almost everyone's list as one of the best burgers in America, and I will have to say that it did not disappoint. Yet, you need to be there by 6 or 6:30 most nights to enjoy it because there is a limited supply, and the restaurant is situated in the middle of Harvard Square where many students and locals flood in early in the evening for drinks and the famous burger.The burger is traditional in many respects: a solid large bun, a substantial amount of charcoal grilled beef, lettuce, tomato, special sauce, and a cheese chip (you know those cheese chips from Whole Foods? yea ...that delicious thing). The burger meat was so juicy, and the taste exactly as I like it. I do not like a lot of extra condiments or toppings on my burgers, so I appreciated that this burger was unique, large and yet traditional. The burger is accompanied with homemade chips.The cocktail list is one of my favorite in the area, and the fact that I arrived at 6:00 pm and left at 10:00 pm may attest to it. My favorite was the Holy Mole mezcal cocktail, but all of the ones I tried were delicious (no disclosure on how many). The service at the bar was attentive and friendly all evening in a perfect kind of way. I'm glad I finally made it to Alder and Harlowe!",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"101,3,"Located right off Harvard Square. I came for the secret burger and some cocktails. Good: the cocktails were very well balanced and fairly priced. Atmosphere was nice, a bit dark, but it fit the bill for the underground gastropub/bar.Average: the burger, in every way. For something that is secret and ultra hyped, I had high expectations. This burger, and its overdone patty and mound of shredded ice berg, was just ok. It wasn't awful by any means but it tasted like Anytown USA bar burger. Bad: the bartender had an attitude. That was annoying but almost felt expected. If you're hoping for the secret burger to wow you, you'll need to be someone who gets off on posting photos of you getting the burger and showing off...rather than the taste itself.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"102,3,"The ~Secret Burger had been on the top of my food priority list. I even made sure to get an early reservation because I heard they had limited availability. Well, I got the burger.... and it was just fine. My boyfriend and I both agreed that it was way more hyped up than it should have been. Don't get me wrong- it was good, but it didn't blow me away at all. My cocktail was also like two sips worth of liquid :/ Otherwise, it was a nice environment- one of those typical restaurants where it's a little too dark. They gave us some complimentary pickles, which were quite tasty. I think I would come here again and give it another chance since it does get such high praise- I just wouldn't order the same food or drink.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"103,5,"The main reason I set foot in Alden was to try their Secret Burger, which has been touted as one of the best burgers in the city. Being the burger aficionado that I am, I was quite disappointed after being seated when I was told they had run out of burgers for the day. I could've just walked out then and there, but I decided to stay and see what else was on the menu.It was the smartest decision I made that day.The food is served in a Tapas style, meant to be shared among friends at the table. There's a wide variety of options for several palettes. Being the carnivore that I am, I made it a priority to try the NY strip steak, and was simply blown away by the incredible amount of flavour in the beef. Other staple items, such as the chicken thigh and latkes were out of this world. And in the event you don't have a massive appetite, the snacks provide a great amount of value and taste. My personal favourites were the Chips and Three Onion Dip and Patatas Bravas. If you get the chance to try their Secret Burger, you should probably go for it. But even if it's unavailable, this restaurant has some of the best tasting Tapas-style food I've had in a very long time, and alongside a stopover at Mike's Pastry, is reason alone to go to Harvard Square.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"104,4,"I feel like the dishes definitely used fresh ingredients and tried to showcase them in natural, more mild flavors that let you taste the ingredients for what they were. But there were a couple dishes where I think they pulled too many flavor punches and could've been more bold with their seasoning and profiles. I'll list the dishes from most to least-liked:Braised Featherbrook RabbitCrispy Berkshire Pork BellyStuffed MorelsLentil HummusChicken Thigh TorchonSourdough with House Cultured Butter and Za'atarBeet FarfalleThe biggest reason we came was to try their Secret Burger, but to our big disappointment, they ran out by 8:30. So seems like they weren't joking around about their ""limited availability.""So I feel like I'm giving the 4-star rating with the assumption that their burger was going to be good. I think the rest of their food somewhat earned that benefit of doubt.Until next time!",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"105,3,"Came here for brunch without reservations and we had to wait about 20-30 minutes, for a party of 4. We ordered:1) sausage & potato skillet $122) croissant toad in the hole $143) hickory smoked pig tails $16Food was just alright, not worth the hype. More like 3.5 stars at most. :)",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"106,3,"Update: They were super accommodating about my onion/garlic intolerance and tried their best to make every dish we ordered allergen-free. However, the food is still subpar. A lot of the flavor combinations were confusing and really didn't work, like the puffed millet on the glazed carrots, or the kumquat sauce with the pork belly. It feels like they tried to be inventive but instead made the dishes worse. My companions also complained the the bread on the mussels was burnt and the mussels had too much parsley. Again, would never come here unless suggested by someone else / didn't have to pay for it myself.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"107,3,"The atmosphere is super cute and the place is much larger than the outside appears. We came for just a drink with friends and sat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and quick to take our orders and make our drinks. We ordered espresso martini's but they didn't have an espresso machine, but had a coffee liquor made in house. The drinks were average but not something that would bring me back there for just drinks. If I go back it will be to try the food",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"108,2,"So what is yelp protocol for a place that has good food, but rude and slow service? That's the conundrum I'm stuck in... you decide:We had reservations with our friends well in advance, and started off rocky when they tried to sit us as at a high table (am I the only one who isn't comfortable when my knees have to be at 45 degrees in order to rest my feet on something?).From there, it took about 10 min to get our drink order in... after it was made somewhere at least 10 miles away... we got our drinks about 25 minutes into the sitting. This would've been overlooked had we not faced problems for the rest of dinner.We had to remind our server on a couple of occasions of items we never received, which she responded by slamming the second plate and spilling the items around the table. At that point it was as awkward as a Trump-Clinton Thanksgiving dinner, so I asked the manager for a change in service.In the end, they comped us a few items and the food was terrific. So it's really upon the reader to judge what kind of experience we had. Would we go back again? Maybe in a year or so to avoid that server.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"109,5,"Great food, hip atmosphere and really good cocktails. Sat at the chefs counter which help in choosing the dishes.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"110,3,"4 stars for food and 2 stars for service. Food is tapas style and a very eclectic mix of flavor profiles, which I enjoyed. We had the corn pancakes, which is super interesting if you like the salty and sweet combo. The brussel sprouts are delicious! We also had the green garlic pasta, which was good but not too special. The chicken thigh is a smaller dish but very good!Service was below average. Staff acts somewhat posh and isn't very friendly.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"111,3,"I'm sorry to say that I don't understand the hype about this restaurant. While the service and atmosphere were excellent, the food just didn't blow me out of the water.We started with the Smoked Trout Toast, which was considered a snack. This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. It had the perfect touch of smokey flavor without being bitter. We also got:*Stuffed Morels- eh. Weird texture and flavors just mush together.*Charred Broccoli- The broccoli was good. The butternut squash was a little too sweet. But $13 for decent broccoli? No.*Crispy Pork Belly- I LOVE pork belly, but the skin on this pork was SO overdone that it was like eating toffee. If you tried to chew it, everything got stuck in your teeth like a caramel. The grits and bits on the plate were pretty tasty though. *Sweet Pea Tortellini- I actually really enjoyed this dish, but my husband was so disappointed this was how we ended the meal. He said it tasted like they took peas, chopped them up and just stuck them in pasta. No sauce, no seasoning, no thing extra. I like peas so I guess this works for me?!Overall, nothing made us want to return. For as much money as we spent ($115 before tip) we would prefer to hop over to their sister restaurant, Waypoint, and have an amazing meal.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"112,5,"My best friend and I had a lovely time at this restaurant! It had the best vibes, and is conveniently located in downtown Harvard Square. The highlight for me was...everything!

Then, we ended with an AMAZING honey soaked apricot dessert with spoon cake and whipped cream.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"113,4,"We all have them: our culinary conquests. You know what I'm talking about....Before I die I have to try this or have to eat there. For me, one item has continually slipped my grasps. I have long heard tales of this burger only being offered in limited quantities and selling out in record times. I've read about it in blogs and lists that has consistently placed it among the best burgers in the country. After years of failure, I have reached the mountain top. Even if that meant eating a burger for breakfast in an attempt to capture the first one out of the kitchen. That's dedication! I stand before you a champion of the Alden and Harlow secret burger! Super hero aside, the burger is good, not great. The beef is juicy and the Parmesan crisp offers a nice texture balance. Not a huge fan of the sauce or the bun. Strangely enough, I found the homemade chips to be stellar, even more so than the burger itself. Overall I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a good burger, but pretty sure if there wasn't all the hype surrounding it, I would have enjoyed it a little more.Now, what to do with this cape.....",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"114,5,"Wow! Â Came by here - almost missed it, slightly hard to find.Came here for brunch / breakfast. Food: innovative, fun, delicious. Â Great service as well!Fantastic design and ambience.

Â Would love to come back for dinner.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"115,5,"ZOMG. Â Alden & Harlow. Â Life-Changing. Â You must come here for this experience! Â I came here for a late-night dinner date.RESTAURANT: Vibes were hella cute. Â Place had a great ambiance, dimly-lit, exposed brick; all the trimmings of yuppie foodie culture! Â One of the art pieces on the wall said, ""The People's Drug"", which I thought was appropriate because the food was so DARN GOOD.SERVICE: The service was impeccable and attentive like restaurants like these usually are. Â But what struck me and my date the most was their timing -- aka PERFECT! Â They give you the exact time you need for each dish. Â The next dish doesn't come too soon, and either get cold sitting on your table, or force you to wolf down your meal (or come too late and leave you feeling sad and hungry.) Â Great job, A&H.DRINKS: We ordered 1) Suit and Thai ($14), 2) Duckhunter ($13), and later on 3) Rum through the Jungle ($12). Â All really good. Â Duckhunter stood out with its strong foie gras flavor -- really interesting in a whiskey drink.FOOD: We ordered two small plates and three large plates.The small plates: 1) the Burrata ($8), and 2) the Chicken Liver Toast ($8). Â #1: The Burrata was pretty standard. Â Not bad, but nothing worth raving about. #2: The Chicken Liver Toast may as well have changed my life. Â THE FLAVORS. Â THE TEXTURES. Â I don't think it's on the menu anymore (idk why?), but this toast both melted in your mouth yet had bite. Â It was sprinkled with some blueberries and nuts, so refreshing and tempering (respectively) in a rich dish! Â We were literally groaning after every bite -- probs made a few people uncomfortable. Â But I digress.The large plates: 1) Wellfleet Countneck Clams ($16), 2) Anson Mills Hush Puppies ($15), and 3) Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly ($16). Â Each deserve their own paragraph of worship.#1: The Countneck Clams were SO good. Â Not only were they stuffed with flavor from the tangy, refreshing parsley sauce, but the freaking PIG'S TAIL. Â My date and I were joking that we were having quite the strange dinner with chicken liver and now pig's tail, but I will now leap to order pig's tail whenever I see it on the menu, because it is like bacon but SO MUCH better. Â Just all this ~flavor~ saturated into a tiny piece of meat. Â Spreading that meat and parsley on the little slices of toast was just DIVINE. #2: The Hush Puppies at first bite felt too salty too me; the bacon was overpowering. Â But upon eating my second bite with a bit of the rhubarb jam that was dolloped elsewhere on the plate, I understood the thought behind the dish. Â The meat was definitely still salty, but not at all in an unbearable way -- it became more like having something really umami. Â The sweetness of the rhubarb jam made it an intriguing combo.#3: The Pork Belly was SO fat and crispy, how I think every pork belly should be. Â It was so darn rich, it felt almost sinful, but I didn't care because it's melt-in-your-mouth goodness made it worth every bite. Â By this time, my date and I were both so full, but the pork belly was so good we ate ourselves into oblivion.IN SUM: Please go to Alden & Harlow for dinner! Â I think most of the reviews on Yelp talk about it for brunch (which I scouted out when I made my first reservation and will sure try out eventually), but I think the creativity and intention behind the dishes they serve at dinner are also deserving of attention.

We also got wine, amazing pizza fresh out of the oven, and bread to snack on. All SO good. We made bread there and then also went home with our own loaves of unbaked dough, which upon following the instructions we were sent home with, came out heavenly.

There was absolutely no urgency from anyone in the entirto make sure we were happy and fed. When the food finally did arrive after waiting an hour - in an order that made absolutely no sense: 1 pizza, appetizer 20 min later, second pizza 10 min after that - I found it to be bland and uninspired. Not worth the wait and certainly not a value for the price. I agree with the other reviewer - come here if you're ok with mediocre food, terrible service, and have a minimum of 2 hours to burn staring at your table mates wondering WTF is going on in the kitchen. I will never come back here again. Pepe Bocca, word travels fast and Yelpers will see that you're not doing enough to right this ship.

In fact it's been so long that I forgot how angry a bad meal makes me.Well, tonight I got to visit those old feelings.Pepe Bocca, an Italian restaurant tucked into an Italian speciality store, proved themselves entirely incapable of even the most basic functions of food service.We waited fifteen minutes before someone even offered us a hello. And that was only after some arm flailing to get his attention. Our server, who was also pulling double duty as host, was so flustered and confused that he had to break out an ""it's my first day.""We ordered two pizzas and a charcuterie board. The first pizza took a half hour, and the second pizza and the charcuterie took a full hour. The entire time we sat in uncomfortable chairs in a sweltering room, envious of every single person that walked past us on Highland Ave because they didn't have to deal with top to bottom incompetence.On a Friday night there was one person in the kitchen. There appeared to be at least two servers and one bus person helping the two tables outside and one first day'er handling the entire inside.When the food did appear, it was a disaster. The dough on the margherita pizza was pillowy and inconsistent, and the slices fell apart in our hands. The mushroom pizza was underdressed and seemingly lacked ingredients, like the promised bÃ©chamel sauce. The charcuterie, in addition to taking an hour, was an uninspired mess. Too-hard salami, too-thick prosciutto, sickly sweet and gummy balsamic, and cheese that paired with noting. And no bread or toast.It is almost invigorating to hate a meal this much.

He wanted to give the restaurant a try, so we stopped by on a Wednesday evening. The place was empty and we were seated immediately. The server recognized my boyfriend from when it was a sandwich place and they chatted about the renovations. She served us some freshly baked olive bread, and later avocado infused bread, which were both unique but didn't taste that amazing. I ordered the gnocchi and my boyfriend the eggplant parmesan, which were strangely the only two options listed under the pasta portion of the menu. My gnocchi was in the oven too long so some of it was a little burnt/overcooked. It tasted like any other gnocchi, and in my opinion was quite overpriced. The eggplant parm had no eggplant to be found. The server saw our dissatisfaction and offered to prepare some spaghetti for my boyfriend for his bowl of what appeared to be just sauce and meatballs. When that arrived, the pasta, which they had prepared with another red sauce, was extremely undercooked. Disappointed, my boyfriend just polished off the meatballs (decent, but not the same as the delicious meatballs in the former deli's meatball subs, according to my boyfriend). We received the check, and the server was very kind and offered us a slice of cake because of our disappointment.

Â In the meantime, we were given some light antipasti to fill our stomachs with an apology from the one person tending to the entire place.However, I don't think one server is a good excuse for a number of reasons.Most importantly, the place is small and we were the only ones in there for a while followed by three other people. Â I've never waited tables but I don't think those numbers are particularly challenging for either the wait staff or the kitchen staff. Â I think I could have been quicker if I showed up to work high on skag with my apron tied around my eyes like a Bedouin.Salmon cooks quickly. Â The most time-consuming aspect of that dish is letting the jus develop flavor. Â That's seven minutes at most. Â It shouldn't take longer than ten minutes from beginning to end unless you're still waiting for the vegetables to grow.Pizza cooks very quickly if you have a wood-fired oven. Â We were told that the chef built the oven himself and it needed some adjustment, hence the delay. Â This is a classic ""out"" for restaurants who don't function well. Â They know you can't disprove claims about kitchen staff and equipment. Â You know you can't disprove those claims. Â They KNOW that YOU know you can't disprove it.So you're forced to accept the excuse and wait. Â I hoped it meant that the chef was a perfectionist and I would soon be enjoying slices of some of the best pizza I'd ever had.I was wrong.When it came out, it looked like something a fourth-grader had made in a cooking class his parents forced him to attend. Â The prosciutto was thrown on messily and there were a few haphazardly placed slices of shaved Parmesan sitting on the prosciutto. Â The sauce was completely flavorless. Â I can forgive modest amounts of cheese and loosely-placed meat as long as there's a lot of meat (and there was) but the sauce is very important. Â It just tasted like a thinned tomato purÃ©e. Â A pizza sauce is supposed to be basic but it usually involves a little bit of cooking, at least with some sautÃ©d onions and garlic.The crust had a nice char and texture and it was by far the best part of the pizza. Â I ate two large slices because that was the only meal I was having that day but it was purely to refuel myself. Â I took no pleasure in the experience. Â If this was sex, it would have been one of those lays you can barely remember because the other person just lay there, more frigid than a nun in Volgograd. Â I call it stopping for gas. Â It's one of the hard truths of life you have to live with.I also wanted to see whether I could improve the leftover slices at home. Â With some mozzarella, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes, it was much better. Â I think Pepe should consider adding just a few chunks of fresh buffalo mozzarella to the base of the pizza to hold everything together. The shaved Parmigiano should go both on the bottom with the mozz and a little bit on top and it should be melted.Melted Parmesan is for pizzas. Â Dry shaved Parm is for salads.Miss K's salmon was actually pretty good and that's why I'm giving this place one more star than I would if I was judging it on the pizza and service alone. Â There was a great charred crust on the salmon, which was cooked perfectly, and the jus was subtly tangy, a flavor profile that complemented the fresh veggies on top perfectly.It took fifteen minutes for the dude to get our check. Â By this time, we'd noticed that another server had started taking orders. Â But, like the old man, there was a puzzling hesitation, almost fear, in the new server's manner. Â They were both polite enough but it seemed like Pepe Bocca listed ""Must be recovering agoraphobe"" in its ad for waiters.I noticed a sluggishness in the kitchen too where people were moving with a remarkable lack of urgency. Â It was past 7 p.m. in a sit-down restaurant for Christ's sake. Â Dinner service should have you scrambling like the third-class people on the Titanic. Â Pretend my mouth is a lifeboat and fill it. Â Fast.Other patrons were waiting for their orders and looking around as well. Â One couple had been waiting almost as long as we had and while we were paying our check, the guy got up to have a stern word with the first server. Â We skipped dessert and when we finally got our check, I felt like Billy Zane did when he used that slum child to get into a lifeboat.____________________*Beating out Barcelona in Brookline. Â This place made Barcelona seem like a deli counter.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"125,4,"A very good dinner with two friends in a restaurant that was pretty quiet for midweek. Perhaps that's just because it was the day before Valentine's? Anyway, we had great service.Their bread is excellent with olive oil. Try not to eat too much of it!I opted for the classic lasagna which comes with two small meatballs. It was not a very big portion but quite tasty. Presented nicely in a small ceramic dish that's also used in the oven to heat it. No points off for that - you don't make lasagna per customer like you do with a pizza. *smile*We opted not to have dessert.The restaurant also has a bunch of Italian goodies for sale including pastas, sauces, and wines. A nice selection of cooking stuff too, if you're looking for a ravioli assembly tray.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"126,4,"What a great find! It's super cute inside - everything is wooden and feels super handcrafted and homey! Â My friend and I ordered the Prosciutto and Fig pizza as well as the lasagna + meatball to share and we left STUFFED! I'm such a sucker for Proscitto and the pizza was delicious! The cheese was slightly too salty for my taste, but I loved the combo of prosciutto, sweet figs, balsamic vinegar, and a handful of greens. Every bite was super flavorful and the crust was also crispy, buttery delicious! It kind of reminded me a bit of a croissant because of its texture and flakiness. And it definitely held up under the weight of all the toppings! The lasagna and meatballs were tasty and definitely homemade with lots of TLC! It was a super tasty meal, and if I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely have to come back!!",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"127,5,"The Funghi pizza was amazing! Highly recommend! The waitress service was great! Can't wait to go back during lunch because their lunch menu looks amazing. If you want to get the Italian fill without being in Italy, this is the place to go! Great selection of wines, reasonable priced. My glass of Pinot Grigio was $8 and it was crisp.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"128,1,"Strap in and get ready for a RIDE if you ever choose to eat at Pepe Bocca. Let me start by breaking it down:1 star food1 star service 5 STAR SHOW I don't know how else to write this review except chronologically. Thank goodness I started taking notes during dinner because this experience was FIRE (not literally). My husband and I had a 7:30 reservation on a Friday night. We arrived a few minutes early and were seated right around 7:30. The waitress comes by a few minutes later and my husband orders a bottle of wine. Around 7:45 my husband waves over the waitress and we order an app, entrees, and the bottle of wine (again). At 8 o'clock, right around when our app (which was the cheese and meat board) was delivered, we can hear the couple next to us getting upset. Since we arrived we hadn't seen the waitress come to their table once. At around 8:15 we started chit chatting with the upset couple. Their wine was empty. They were out of bread. They had been there since 7:15 and hadn't yet gotten their food and also hadn't had a waitress come by in nearly 45 minutes. They were mad. After joking around about just leaving they finally decide they can't wait anymore and walk out. That was at 8:38pm. Yes, it had been an hour and 15 minutes since they ordered and an hour since the waitress had even spoken to them. At 8:40 we hear a four top ask for status - they ordered their food an hour ago and wanted to eat sometime that night. At 8:44 the waitress shows up at the empty table with the entrees that couple ordered. She got mad at US! That table had been ignored when there were warm bodies there and then sat empty for 6 minutes. Yea this is my fault - the person not sitting there. Waitress - ""did they leave?!"" Me - ""yes"" Waitress - ""without paying??!!?!?"" Me - ""well you ignored them for an hour.""At 8:50 my husband and I joke that the reason the food is taking so long is they're making my lasagna with a blow torch. Does it help that the kitchen was an open kitchen and we could see everything going on - which was very little - or that there's a weird second kitchen in the back with just random pots of water sitting around? I don't know. I'm not a chef I guess. But we started seeing the kitchen melting down at this point. The waitress told the chef (who was literally the only person in the kitchen) that a table left without paying and he STORMED THE F OUT. It was gold. At 8:51 pm a family asks for status and the waitress confirms that, yes - the person making all the food, the chef - left. So the family leaves. A two top leaves. Another four top leaves. The waitresses are crying.My husband and I have been talking to two other couples and we are actually wondering, are we on a reality tv show? A diff couple says ""maybe this is some sort of experiment for someone's PHD program."" TOTALLY PLAUSIBLE because I've never experienced a night like this. But at 8:52 my husband and I decide, we've had enough. Whatever social experiment this was, we were actually hungry. Also, after nearly an hour and 45 minutes waiting maybe we should just accept that our food was never coming. The hubs asked for our check and our waitress said our food would be delivered in less than 10 minutes. At this point the chef walks back in, this time with ANOTHER CHEF! I didn't believe the waitress so I set a timer on my phone. The second we hit 10 minutes we were leaving. At the 9 minute mark - you will not believe this - THE CHEF TAKES A BLOW TORCH TO A PLATE OF LASAGNA. would you believe it was my lasagna? If you've seen this movie you know that it is. Right at the 10 minute mark my husband's gnocchi and my blow-torch-lasagna are delivered. The food was super not good and def not worth the wait or the cost. But I would eat here again in a heartbeat if I can be guaranteed another show. So, long story short. If you don't like good Italian food and you have minimum two hours to burn - I would highly recommend Pepe Bocca",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"129,1,"I loved the old grab-and-go concept, but the new sit-down one sadly isn't working. The restaurant has been looking full, but I'm guessing it's because everyone is waiting an unacceptably long time for their food.My friends and I had a 7 pm reservation on Wednesday night. We got two pasta dishes, one eggplant parm, and a personal pizza--nothing too different from what they sold before. We waited 2 hours for the pastas and eggplant parm, and 2.5 hours for the pizza. The owner was very arrogant about it, said that ""good food takes time,"" blamed the freshness of the ingredients... but the food was also mediocre. We saw my friend's gnocchi sit under a heat lamp for 45 minutes (which the owner denied), and it was mush by the time we got it.Please go back to the old concept! I really loved Pepe Bocca and want to see you succeed, but you cannot make customers wait this long and justify it with ""good food takes time."" Some empathy for your customers while you work out the kinks will go a long way.I will caveat that they gave us each a free glass of wine and desserts, and our server was very kind.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"130,1,"As many reviews have stated, Pepe used to be a perfectly rustic, top-notch eatery for both sit-in and take-out. Their food was the best Italian in the area and the pizza/deli/dessert section was exactly what locals wanted: delicious convenience; we don't need/want more overpriced fancy sit-down places, even if their service did eventually run smoothly. You stood out in Davis for not being like the rest of Davis.If anything, please let the takeaway of this review be: RETURN TO OLD PEPE! Your business will thrive and your people will happily return! Quick amazing service is what we want.My bf and I went to Pepe for dinner. Ordered our food. Bread came and that was the last thing we'd eat there. Waited 50 minutes for our 2 entrees. My bf went to our server, asking for the update, to which he was told ""I'll go check."" Our server didn't update us and instead flurried around the kitchen, the staff getting visibly mad at one another. I swear they tried to cook our dishes 3x because after 65+ minutes of patient waiting we walked out. And so did the couple next to us. At least 3 other tables were fully served before us - and they arrived way after!!Please return to old Pepe cuz that setup was the bomb and we're sad about that loss.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"131,5,"Great spot for a group of friends and delicious food! Walking into the store, there are fresh pastries, fresh cheese and meats, and an assortment of pastas to buy. We ordered sandwiches and sat on a large picnic bench on the other side of the store. The decoration is minimal, but everything you need is there! They have a TV that was showing a soccer game and a jug of water with lemons and ice! The food was nothing short of fantastic! The bread was soft and chewy and the ingredients were all super fresh. I got a prosciutto sandwich with mozzarella cheese and vegetables. The meat was salty and tender, the cheese tasted very fresh and the vegetables were the perfect topping. My friend got the avocado sandwich with wild mushrooms. The avocado was a small spread at the bottom of the sandwich, but the mushrooms and pesto tasted fantastic! You can have wine and small side dishes with your meal. The space is roomy and the staff was all very nice! Great place for a Saturday lunch or to hide away from the summer heat! :)",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"132,1,"I went to this restaurant a few days ago. I made a reservation on a Friday at 6:30 p.m. When I showed up, multiple tables were available.. Bad sign.Everyone was complaining about the waiting times, some people had been waiting for more than one hour! I ordered the gnocchi and the Lasagna... I waited for 45 minutes and the plates never came... I told them I was leaving since I had movie tickets, they did not care, they did not apologize, they just canceled the orders and that was it!Since you can see the kitchen area from your table, I was able to hear all the employees screaming at each other, it was a complete mess! What a stressful place to have dinner.This was extremely disappointing and I am not coming for obvious reasons. Do you want affordable italian food in this area? Please drive 2 miles and go to Twirl in Arlington, that's an amazing place!",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"133,1,"Pepe Bocca is not ""Good for Lunch"", as their Yelp page would have you believe, because they in fact do not even serve lunch any more. They used to be a fantastic lunch spot where you could grab a delicious sandwich or Italian entree, but for some reason they decided to transition into an overpriced, sit-down, dinner-only restaurant. Please turn this ship around!",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"134,4,"Pepe Bocca's is still evolving following a recent renovation this past summer. The spot is a one-stop shop offering everything from sit-down dinners, specialty groceries to a quick bite at lunch from a takeout corner. Although some items in the shop are a bit overpriced, Pepe's remains a foodie paradise and a gem in the neighborhood. Their espresso and cannoli are always on point. The focaccia pizza is also fantastic and Wagner who has been working this station is one of the friendliest people you'll meet this side of the Charles River! The only underwhelming item I have tried was the lasagna, but maybe that's because my expectations were high given my experience otherwise! Overall, definitely worth a stopping by for the best pizza and cannoli in the area.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"135,3,"I loved this spot when it was an Italian market of sorts. The sandwich counter was amazing along with the fresh breads and other baked goods. The pizza is the best in the area by far. I never ordered any serious meal there while it was operating as a market (lacking any better way to describe it). I did meet one girl who did and she waited an hour to receive her order (ravioli) while never receiving an update from the folks making the plate. That said, the three star rating is for the service. Pepe's food is VERY good, but management has done a poor job. Before it transitioned to its current restaurant status order fulfillment took a while and order taking was a confused process. From the recent reviews, that has carried over to Pepe's run as a restaurant. I used to work around that by calling in an order at least 45 minutes beforehand (even for a couple sandwiches) but that's no longer an option.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"136,4,"I really like it here. They have cleaned it up a lot recently and the atmosphere has definitely improved. The food is genuine and comforting. I would take a first date here. It is quiet, simple and nice.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"137,1,"Ok I was trying HARD to not eviscerate Pepe B but these other completely hysterical and accurate one star reviews have inspired me to lay bare my soul. My daughters and I wandered into this culinary abyss on a cold winters night, looking for some Italian sustenance. Like other reviewers, we stood in the entryway for upwards of seven minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence. Someone, that is, other than the one other table of patrons Who were in the joint. Looking back, I think one of them was trying to make eye contact with me -perhaps to tell me by way of eye blink Morse code to head for ze hills. Alas I missed the cue, and my daughters and I were eventually seated at an enormous family style table by ourselves. The waiter, a bumbling, fumbling chap (who seemed like he had dropped out of the ceiling from some bizarro dimension) promptly informed us that the wood fired oven pizza was really awesome, and also it would take over an hour to make. I shit you not--he told Â us no less than five times: ""it's really great though, the chef makes the dough in the basement."" As if that was some kind of selling point. Pizza. Dough. made. in. A. basement. Â Let's pause and consider that this so called excellent pizza would take over an hour. There was precisely one other party in the establishment at the time. A pizza from Mikes around the corner might take 15 minutes. A frozen pizza takes 20 minutes. But Pepe Bocca's pizza Was so goddamn good, with its basement crafted dough, that it was going to take over an hour to be served. So we opted for three servings of gnocchi which was the only other thing on the menu besides lasagna. For some reason that stopped the waiter in his tracks, and it occurred to me that maybe the gnocchi was also made in this magical basement and was therefore also going to take ""over an hour."" But the garÃ§on assured me that this dish was NOT basement-crafted so would be plated in under 30 minutes. I then proceeded to order a glass of wine and two drinks for my children and I won't even get into how long we waited to get those drinks while this buffoon stood behind a screen staring at the wall. Finally the gnocchi arrived and it was sub par at best. Mealy and sparse, swimming in burnt, overly salted sauce. By this point there was no disguising my displeasure, and I asked the waiter to bring the check. He then vaporized for another ten minutes. When he finally reappeared, I waved him over and asked for the check again, to which he replied ""oh didn't I already bring you that?"" Allow me to remind you all that there was still only Â one other party in the joint. As we were leaving I realized that this was the same party that was seated when we came in. They must've ordered pizza.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"138,4,"Cute Italian market that also doubles as a good place to grab lunch (pizzas, sandwiches etc). I've only been once so far and had a pretty good experience. Husband and I stopped by to try their lunch options, we each got a sandwich and coffee. I had a portobello, husband had the Italian. Coffee was good. Both sandwiches were very solid, but my reason for a 4/5 is because they didn't wow me. Perhaps it's biased and unfair, but I love Dave's Fresh Pasta and because they seem to offer similar products and food options I can't help but compare. I would definitely come again to try their other lunch options. Tip: there's two food counters to check out, one for cold subs sandwiches, and coffee which is where we ordered. Another that seemed to offer hot options like pastas, pizzas, paninis etc. I would also come back to check out their market options. While quickly browsing, I saw they had imported products like coffee makers and pasta, and fresh bread.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"139,1,"Unfortunately I wasn't able to try anything here as service was very poor. We walked in at 815 on a Friday night directly next to another table who had been there a bit. While the server walked over to their table to drop off food not once, but twice, he never even acknowledged our presence or let us know he'd be a minute. After sitting for 10 minutes with no one coming by we walked out, which I'm disappointed about because I was excited to try the food as the menu looked good!",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"140,5,"Juliet is one of our neighborhood favorites--we've been here for brunch and dinner.

We were in Boston for a wedding, and wanted to have a nice brunch the morning of. We found this place while exploring on Google, and it sounded nice.It was the perfect choice. It was in a cute little neighborhood and had a very homey feel. It was a smaller establishment, but I think it was good for the feel of the restaurant. This place is a tip free establishment, which is really cool. The servers get paid an established wage, but the prices of the food don't seem to reflect it. They were friendly and easy going. We started with a bloody Mary, which was delicious, and we ordered the Riviera sandwich and breakfast burger with a fried egg. Both items came with a small salad and some potatoes. The potatoes were different, but pretty good. They had dill and some mustard or horseradish. We also had a ginger molasses cookie and a cranberry cream cheese coffee cake. The whole meal was delicious, and I would recommend it to a friend. Hopefully, someday I can go back and try some other items.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"142,3,"I had high expectations for this restaurant but the entire menu was so highly focused on egg dishes and trying too hard to be ""crunchy"". I ordered the maple sugar toast which was just a $5 wet piece of bread, not warm & toasted, with a sugary spread on it.Next up was the main course of an egg sandwich. It's hard to mess up and egg sandwich but I found it unappetizing and hard to eat. Served on ""fresh"" pita, this pita bread was hard, maybe stale, and difficult to bite into. The first bite I took, the entirety of the inside slid out and had to eat the entire sandwich with a fork and knife. The combination of one egg, hummus, feta and pesto was rather gross.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"143,4,"Juliet makes wonderful food, and I particularly loved their deserts (or maybe they're better called snacks, or treats).

Oysters were good for a $1 but as most $1 oysters you can't expect them to be quite as good as the expensive ones. The place is super cute, we sat at the bar and had no wait. The menu is limited so check it out before you go go. We had a delicious mushroom cream and spinach pasta. THey did not skimp on the mushrooms which I really appreciate, all types and sizes. Cooked to perfection. Really nice but a tad too lemony if you ask me. Still great though. Also a lamb burger with amazing tzatziki sauce that I loved. Left nice and pink in the middle it wasn't overly greasy. Really good roasted potatoes on the side as well. Also had a ""Rachel's in charge', essentially a negroni with tequila instead of gin. This was probably the weakest part of the meal. Like the drink tasted weak. A bit too much vermouth, not enough campari or tequila... or maybe tequila just isn't as flavorful.

And this place to me just reconfirmed that. I ordered some fish tacos while my friends ordered more classic brunch plates with toast, eggs and a salad of some form. None of it was that amazing and the fish tacos were rather small and not satiable. The potato salad basically consisted of raw potatoes that IMO were inedible. The eggs were fine, but really how hard is it to cook an egg. The only part I liked was that the wait staff are paid fairly, so not tipping involved.Otherwise, don't see the hype, nothing special, pretty bland food.

My americano had a nice layer of crema though and was pretty good tasting. Service was also friendly and reasonably fast.

If you are a type of foodie that likes to try different food combinations, this place is definitely a place to try. The meal I ordered was something I was not used to. It was delicious however I found some parts of it a bit overpowering (maybe if they put less on the plate I wouldn't feel obligated to eat it all haha) but I don't regret ordering what I ordered at all!Cost: A bit expensive for breakfast. For example, the caramelized grapefruit was a couple dollars. A bit steep but it was delicious though! Just be aware that it is the cost of both the food and experience that you are paying for.Environment: Very quaint. Although the exterior of the restaurant doesn't really stand out, the interior is something to definitely take a look at. They utilized antique items to decorate the place and it worked out very well! Service: The server was amazing! Everyone in the restaurant seemed to really enjoy working there and that was reflective of the attitude they gave to the customers. Uniqueness: I did not know of this until the end as the bill was about to get paid but they do not accept tips! It was such a surprise, especially because they did such an awesome job. There is a basket towards the front that is open to anyone who is willing to donate money for a funding that they do. I don't remember the specifics but I have never seen anything like this!Not a place to go everyday but definitely once in a while when in the area. Both to have an interesting meal but also support a good cause.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"156,4,"This place boils down to four words: overpriced, hippie bird feed.Nevertheless, it still deserves a 4-star in my book. This is why: even though the brunch menu items are on the pricey side, with rather small portions (the bird feed part), the bang for buck ratio is still good because the quality of food you would get here is high. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh, probably purchased locally, and from a farmers market. I really like their business model of profit-sharing between the owner and all the employees working there (the hippie part). Despite this place being kind of pricey for what you get, I support fair compensation for the employees, so I don't mind paying a little more than normal for brunch food.They also have an open kitchen inside the cafe so you can see exactly how your food is made. The cafe itself is very clean, which I like alot. They don't ask you for a tip on top of your bill. What you see is what you get since they pay their employees fairly and everyone has a share of the cafe.I had the brunch item with eggs, toast, and smoked salmon (forgot what it was called), and a latte. Their latte is delicious! Definitely get it if you are there. While the smoked salmon dish I got was good and healthy (not your typical greasy American brunch food), my only complaint of this place is their portion size. As you can see, I am not exactly a bird nor am I on a diet. If their portion size were bigger, I would not have left the cafe feeling a bit hungry (the only thing I thought they could improve on)....if it wasn't for the portion size, I would certainly give this place a 5-star.Oh, and if you get coffee here, they also would refill it for free, which is always a perk!",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"157,5,"I've watched Somerville's steady gentrification over the last 20 years, so a fancy toast restaurant seemed like the natural next step. Â Although it took me a year, I'm glad I finally managed to get over my skepticism and stop by, because Juliet is a neighborhood gem!This review is for the prix fixe dinner ($69 for 3 courses, $90 for 5 courses). The menu makes use of plenty of fresh, seasonal vegetables and flavors. The offerings change every couple of weeks--check their website for more info!The April/early May menu featured roasted lamb, but Chef Josh was kind enough to make a vegetarian version for me, substituting roasted cauliflower. I really didn't feel like I was missing out--the cauliflower was covered in a rich beurre blanc sauce with tons of fresh herbs and lemon! Â I'm not very strict about animal products like caviar, fish sauce, and lard, but they were super careful about finding substitutions for all of these ingredients. You can add wine pairings, but I opted for the nonalcoholic turmeric tonic instead. Whether or not turmeric has any health benefits, I enjoyed the light flavor and beautiful golden color of my beverage!The only criticism I have is that I think they could potentially benefit from a separate pastry chef. Dessert was my least favorite course; the texture of the pound cake was off.I love that they include tip in the prices, and I hope this practice catches on at other Somerville restaurants. Besides the fact that it's better for the waitstaff, it's more convenient not to have to waste time calculating the tip at the end of your meal! Â So even though the menu is a bit pricey, it's not as bad as it seems once you remember that tip is included.Juliet will join Bergamot and L'Espalier my list of great prix fixes in this area, and I can't wait to come back and try breakfast!",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"158,3,"It was... fine. For something that's marketed as a whole ""experience,"" for which you have to buy tickets in advance, it was decidedly underwhelming. Nothing was really bad but nothing rose to the level of what they seem to be selling. We did the ""Beach Rose"" dinner, for $53 (including tip) per person, then spent a couple more bucks per person on drinks. My favorite dishes were probably the first two: the complimentary bread, which was slightly sweet and very soft, accompanied by chili butter and lobster roe (couldn't taste it), and the burrata, which had preserved lemon and microgreens and was a light way to start the meal. The main course took a while to come out to us, and it was served family-style (we had four people). The poached hake was a little salty, and the vegetables (carrots, radishes, zucchini) were so randomly and roughly chopped that they weren't cooked evenly. I tried to stab a pretty raw and hard carrot (which I understand is edible, but threw me off when everything else in the mix was much more tender). Then we got a palate cleanser pickle dish of (I think) zucchini and onion. It was sweeter than I would prefer and didn't do much for me -- I actually think the Â flavor was kind of heavy, for a palate cleanser. Â The dessert was a strawberry shortcake. It was a little dry overall. There were two little halves of a biscuit, some roasted strawberries and just a hint of whipped cream. Portions are small; my one guy friend said he was about 60% full at the end. Since we picked the early dinner option we couldn't add supplements, which can be ordered at an extra cost. The restaurant is cute but the tables are all crowded to one side. I get that during the day there are people ordering baked goods to go at the counter area near the door, but at night it seems like you could spread things out so people aren't so close to each other. They also need better ventilation, because it got smoky throughout the evening. Service was fine but the pacing was slow. We spent two full hours there for a three-ish course meal (and we didn't even have to place our orders), which feels a little excessive.I like the idea of the restaurant but not the execution. Including tip seems reasonable and I like the seasonal approach, but the overall experience just wasn't impressive.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"159,4,"Updating this review since Josh, the owner, reach out re: costs. ""Our staffing model is different than most restaurants with everyone making a living wage and no one working for tips"" is what he said. I really did feel like the model of Juliet was different and that everyone was working toward the common goal of making sure you had a great experience and not overly nice to work for tips (as I've done as a server haha). Can't wait to join them for dinner!__________________________________________I found this charming place on our way home from the dog park. We were able to grab a table outside with our dog. I had never been and walked inside to the counter, the design of this place was really nice. The open kitchen is what impressed me the most. A chic, upscale restaurant without being too pompous. Someone helped me and kindly explained that it wasn't a full service, but if we ordered, it was brought to the table.I ended up getting tea and the Parisienne breakfast with toast, soft boiled eggs and butter/jam and my boyfriend got a latte and something else that we can't seem to remember what it was called. Absolutely delicious though.It was a little pricey, but I enjoyed the aesthetics and how well/quickly we were served. Would definitely come back again.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"160,5,"Carmelina's is true to its tagline ""Twist on Tradition"" and they're twisting me in all the right ways (heh-heh)! The Boy and I made a lunch rez to come as part of his 'eat-all-the-Carbonaras-in-Boston' kick. Good thing we did because the tables were pretty full (~1PM on a Saturday - you definitely could still walk-in and grab a seat though if you are a gamblin' man ... or woman).To start, you are promptly served water and given a plate of warm, fluffy, light bread with a olive oil & balsamic dip. We ate two servings of this ... it was that good. We also split their take on a Caprese Salad. A very smooth bufala mozzarella served with a beautiful palate of tomatoes (green, orange, & red). The plate had a ring of balsamic around the outside and a perfect portion of fresh pesto underneath the magical mozzarella. Combine each individual aspect of this dish on your fork for the PERFECT bite! My only minor gripe was there were more tomatoes than everything else but that is to be expected.The Boy's carbonara was great. He thought it was a little more alfredo-y/saucy than he liked - maybe because it lacked an egg - but the taste itself was still really good.I decided to give puttanesca sauce a first try here because I saw the word ""spicy"" in front of ""puttanesca sauce."" Unfortunately, I did not know puttanesca sauce was heavy on olives; I found it to be VERY salty instead of 'spicy' although I have no other puttanesca experience to compare it to. That being said, I still enjoyed my dish, took home the leftovers, and finished it the next day ... albeit it, I threw a fried egg on top and called it breakfast. A runny yolk helped cut the saltiness. I ate it all at the end of the day so that is not a testament against their puttanesca but a compliment to how great their pasta at its foundation is.100% will be returning to Carmelina's because I NEED to try the Tonno con Pesto Siciliano e Fusilli (it's ahi tuna on fusilli in pesto sauce!) and also the Crazy Alfredo (chicken AND sausage in - what I hope is true to its name - a SPICY alfredo sauce?!). Like I said, I'm diggin' the 'twist' Carmelina's is serving up!",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"161,4,"Ok, the crazy alfredo was some of the most delicious pasta I've ever had. I really dislike heavy food, but for such an indulgent dish, I felt like I could keep eating and eating this dish. Of course it was greasy and heavy, but you never feel that way eating the dish! The pasta, made in house, was perfectly chewy. AHH I'm just drooling thinking about the dish. I also ordered the octopus salad dish - very lemony and fresh, great to counteract the crazy alfredo. My fiance also ordered the meatballs as an appetizer, which were delicious although I wish we were given more bread. The only mediocre thing about the restaurant was the bread...I feel like I'm used to a certain level of fluffiness in the north end, but this bread was just mediocre. Additional stars for being able to reserve seats online - a great plus for the north end.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"162,3,"The food was good, but not to the my expectations from reading the reviews on Yelp. It's located in the North End so it's definitely limited in seating. Get reservations if you can. We came with a party of 6 during lunch and were sat in the front. Thankfully the patio window was open or else we wouldn't be able to get into our seats! If you are sat in the front, the tables are situated very close together that the back of your seat is going to be touching the back of the person sitting behind you. We got quite a few things. The Gnocchi, carbonara, spaghetti with clams, crazy alfredo, meatball appetizer, fried calamari, and eggplant appetizer. Unfortunately, nothing really wowed us except the crazy alfredo. I would come back just for this dish. I've never seen it anywhere else and it was by far the best tasting. When reading the reviews, everyone said get the gnocchi. So we did. It seems like they bake the gnocchi so when you use your fork to stab it, it'll become mushy. It begins to clump with the other gnocchi and the next thing you know you have a plate of mashed potatoes. The carbonara says it's made the real way on the menu. I guess I'm not a fan of the real way. Oh, the free bread was pretty amazing. Super fresh with a semi hard outside and super soft inside. It also took a long time to get our entrees after we had finished our appetizers. Seems like they only have 1 chef preparing them.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"163,4,"Bronx Tale!OMG this is my new favorite meal in Boston's North End. It comes with 3 meatballs, and an Italian sausage, rigatoni in meat sauce. You have to be be quite hungry to finish it. The bread and butter could be improved (maybe they could get some from Panza's. They know Italian bread!). The calamari was just ok here and came with peppers instead of marinara sauce.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"164,4,"A lovely spot in North End with home-cooked taste and an elegant atmosphere. It fills with reservations quickly but there's often room at the bar if you hang around. The cool thing with the bar is it's right next to the open kitchen so you can see all the magnificent dishes being made, complete with the occasional fireball! We had the fresh calamari salad and spicy shrimp. Both had fresh ingredients, good portion size even for appetizers, and a clear taste of quality. My only qualm was that the sauces were not that strong in flavor and personality. I was hoping for more richness and spice from the red sauce for the spicy shrimp, especially. The giant family sized pasta platters looked amazing and I can't wait to come back for that. Also, as the menu states, they cook carbonara ""the real way!""",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"165,5,"Wow, I can't believe I've missed out on Carmelina's until now. I stopped in for dinner on Sunday and the place was quite packed. Fortunately, a stool at the kitchn bar opened up and the hostess brought me right to it.

Who doesn't really love watching their meal being prepared?They call it ""Sunday Macaroni"" and it's available every day. Suggestion"" Be hungry. This is a huge meal. A big portion of pasta. One large braised beef short rib. A locally made pork sausage. Three (yes, three!) meatballs. And a scoop of ricotta that was at least a cup. Jeez.

MMMMmmmmmmmm! Sooooo goooooood! Everything was unbelievable! Highly recommend reservations on a Friday or Saturday night since the place is on the smaller side and right in the heart of the North End. Started out with the Risotto Caprese. Real deal mozzarella and risotto were fresh and outstanding. You know the real thing when you taste it. No corners are cut here. For my main dish, got the Gnocchi al Forno. Pasta and mozzarella cheese just melts in the mouth. Potato pasta dumplings are something I can't stop talking and dreaming about. Also had some of the penne gorgonzola which was 5 star material. Chicken with burrata was delicious. Gotta try all of it. The adjectives used to describe the food just don't do it justice. Â They also provided complimentary hot fresh bread with oil and vinegar.Service was terrific. Waitress consistently checked on us and was quick.

It was July 4th and He first told us the restaurant was fully booked and took our name and number in the event someone cancelled. He kept his word and called us 15 min later. We came back and were seated almost immediately. We had fried calamari for appetizer which were very good. Â Pasta Gorgonzola for me. Pasta and clams for the wife. Both dishes were top notch.

I came here with my husband for a late lunch on a Friday. We ordered meatballs as an appetizer and split the carbonara pasta dish. The meatballs were tender and the marinara sauce was lovely with fresh basil. The pasta was homemade, chewy, and delicious. I will say it was a bit heavy it was well worth the calories. The staff was friendly and attentive - even though there wasn't a single empty table.

Everything looked so good! For us, we were recommended Carmelina's and it did not disappoint!! The space was tiny (and seemingly always packed with patrons), but we had reservations so there was no wait at all. All the pastas are made in house so it was a difficult choice for me to make when it came to dinner entrees. We ended up going with the Penne Capricciose and Frutti di Mare and wow, oh wow. The pastas were perfectly cooked and the sauces were absolutely magnificent: bold and comforting at the same time. My mouth is watering just thinking about our meal here. My one regret, though, is not ordering an appetizer. Carmelina's has made it to the top of my list for some of the best Italian food I've had in my life!

I wish they had offered us more. :(Got the Baked 4 mushroom rigatoni.Loved the texture of the breadcrunbs on top. I don't really like cheese, but loved this. The rigatoni were perfectly bit sized. There were the right amount of mushrooms, not too many not too few. It was cooked to order and came out nice and hot.

Top notch service. The staff checked on us, refilled water, and brought and processed our check quickly. It was like a well-oiled mahcine.

An overall wonderful experience.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"172,2,"WHAT IS ALL THIS HYPE?!I decided on the carbonara because someone in front of me said that it was heavenly. While I wouldn't describe this dish as heavenly, it wasn't terrible. There was a good amount of pepper and pancetta in there and I did enjoy the thick, chewy pasta noodle they used. My friend got plain pasta and meatballs with red sauce. She said they whole dish was bland and that she hated the thick, chewy pasta noodle (same noodle as mine). The food overall was very mediocre in my opinion. The 2 star rating is for service. We came on a Saturday at 2:30p and the place was busy but not packed. The hostess told us that the wait would be 15 minutes for a table and we decided to wait. When we returned 15 minutes later, there were plenty of Â tables open but the hostess had not called us. She only seated us when we asked again. We were sat in a corner of the restaurant and I just felt ignored the entire time.

It's interesting to me that fried calamari is the dish that will show up on the menu for lots of different cuisine: Japanese, Italian, Spanish, etc. the fried calamari in Carmelina's will surprise you! It's a little bit spicy so it perfectly balance with the deep fried part. It doesn't taste oily and you won't get tired of it.

It's sushi-grade ahi tuna served slightly seared on a bed of crispy potatoes and topped with olive tapenade and fresh basil. It was as delicious as it was beautiful. Our entrees were equally impressive. My husband ordered the Sunday Macaroni and I ordered the Frutti di Mare.

The meals however left a bit to be desired after seeing how good the food could have been. My chicken entree was very good, but my girlfriend's carbonara was a bit too peppery and the noodles, while fresh, were far too thick. The price also holds back the 5 stars.

I highly recommend making a reservation to this place (Which is what I did on Yelp). The restaurant is pretty small (but more tables than Daily Catch next door) and their biggest table can only seat 6. The menu has dozens of appetizers, pasta dishes, and main dishes to choose from. With four of us, we ordered pasta dishes such as Sunday Macaroni (one of their most popular dishes), the Crazy Alfredo, Spaghetti with Clams, and more. The Sunday Macaroni was a lot to the point where I ended up taking 2/3 of it home due to the amount of meatballs, sausage, and the beef rib they included with the pasta. However, my personal favorite of the dishes we had was the Crazy Alfredo, personally since I thought the spicy alfredo sauce that was used in this dish was rich in flavor, was unique, and was not heavy in cream.I highly recommend coming to Carmelina's if you are in North End looking for great Italian food.

It works for large groups for food, and as a drinking den.However I have mixed feelings about this place. On a Sunday night when I went it, it was relatively empty but exceptionally loud. Raucous clientele and unhelpful acoustics meant I couldn't even hear my dinner companion seated across from me. Surely there has to be some level at which decibels turn from pleasantly energetic to unacceptable because it drives away business.The food was okay - but why call something a extra Dirty Caesar salad when most of it is kale anyway? It so little resembles a Caesar that it's a kale salad anyway!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"190,3,"Came here with a few friends for some drinks and late night food. I ordered a beer, my friends some mixed drinks. The waitress came over really quickly once we ordered our drinks. We got seated right away, it was a Monday night so not very busy. For food we ordered a flatbread pizza, after waiting probably almost 40 minutes the waitress came over and notified us the kitchen burned our pizza. They made us another one but even that one was a little burned as well. We had a great time regardless but not sure if I'd go back.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"191,4,"When I think of Russell House Tavern, I will remember the ambiance, the food, and the fact that the restaurant could use a few more lightbulbs (the basement is dimly lit!!)Ambiance is pleasant, soothing, ideal for family dinners, date night, Â celebratory meals, or if you're looking for a place for a post-work drink. The food was simple and traditional. Nothing to exotic or fancy - again which compliments the ambiance. You can confidently bring any type of eater and here and not be concerned about whether or not they will be able to find something on the menu. I ordered Heritage Pork 3 Ways (house made linguisa, tenderloin, and pork shoulder) over grits. It was phenomenal and one of the best pork dishes I've had a a restaurant to date. The tenderloin was tender and juicy. The pork shoulder was perfectly seasoned and melted in your mouth. The house made linguisa (Portuguese pork sausage) may not as well known, but it is a must try! The rest of the the table got the famous and popular Russell House Burger. I had a bite of the burger and can see why it is one of their most ordered items! Tender, juicy, prime beef burger between, *wait for it*, two english muffins for buns. Unbelievable.The staff were polite, friendly, and helpful. They were quick with recommendations for food and drinks tailored to your likes and dislikes. If you're in the area, I certainly would recommend this restaurant. Parking can be tough in Harvard Square but there are plenty garages in walking distance!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"192,4,"Right in the center of action. We enjoyed an Extra Dirty Caesar Salad, a Soup du jour and a couple drinks while seated in the window. We were shown our table quickly and the service was great. We were hoping for the atmosphere to be a little quieter and the salad to be dressed a little lighter...both minor! This is a great place to window watch!!!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"193,3,"I was pretty excited to try this place because of all the passionate reviews! I was impressed by how large the place was. From the outside it looks like a first level tavern with outside seating - I was worried we might have to wait. This was on a Saturday at 3pm. However, there was a great round table for 5 downstairs waiting for us. The room was very dimly lit for such a nice day outside it was a stark contrast. The ambiance was nice and deserves a 4. However, the food was very subpar. I got a lobster slider - which had maybe the smallest amount of lobster I have seen smeared on a fairly dry bun with arugula. I split the grilled chicken Caesar salad with a friend. I wasn't expected to be blown away by a salad, but the lobster slider was disappointing. The boyfriend got the roast beef which was okay but nothing special. Someone else got the burger and I would expect it to be pretty great at a place like this - but it was very subpar. The fries were pretty delicious though. I don't think I would return with so many other food options in Harvard square.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"194,5,"Very busy, even on a Monday night, for both outdoor and indoor seating. The food was delicious. My husband wasn't hungry so he got the spicy crispy calamari in the small plates menu and I got the pork three way in a entree menu. Funny enough his plate came bigger than mine. Lots of peppers and arugula on his plates though. He said his calamari was delicious. The pork was delicious, my favorite one was the sausage, i cleared it in 3 bites, the pork belly was fatty but yummy. The pork shoulder was tough, it does have a veru good smoky flavor and good grilled marks. I dont know why they grill such a tough cut though. It came with grit and I am not a big grit fan but this was delicious, very creamy and flavorful, almost like mash potato consistency. Parking wasn't particularly hard. Seating was very close so you can hear whatever people saying next to you. Definitely not kid family. It could get very noisy sometimes.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"195,5,"We chose Russell House Tavern based on its proximity to the Loeb Theater. 12:45 reservation prior to a 2 pm show. Seated downstairs in a cozy (and comfortable) table. Told our server our show time, and she assured us we'd be out in plenty of time. I ordered the anti-Benedict, and he ordered the Nutella French toast. Each had a cocktail too. Clearly, she expedited our order as it came out in what seemed like 5 minutes. Nice!His French toast was fantastic. My anti-Benedict was very good. The server described it as a standard poached egg that is flash fried and still has a runny yoke. The yikes on mine were hard cooked. Still very tasty. Next tine I'd get the regular eggs Benedict. If that's the worst thing that happens, I'll call it a win. Great atmosphere, outstanding service and good food. That's a trifecta.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"196,5,"On my reservation, I mentioned that I would be celebrating my sisters birthday and Russell House did a fantastic job of making it extra special. They called a few hours ahead of time to make sure we were all 21 and we didn't have any food allergies. Once we got there the wait staff surprised us with glasses of champagne on the House! My drink, The It's Always Sunny, was fantastic and the food was great! I got the steak frites, while the rest of my family got the grilled chicken and the 3 way pork. We were all well impressed with the food and selection. Finally they surprised us with dessert, which was fantastic!The atmosphere and ambiance was great as well. Really nice place to celebrate a special occasion as its busy but not too loud. Can't wait to come here again!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"197,3,"Despite the popularity of Russell House Tavern, I had a fairly mediocre lunch with The Boy and his family. We all got a sandwich; I tried the Slow-Roasted ""Char Siu"" Pork Loin.I was hopeful and skeptic and my skeptic self was proven right. The pork was more dry loin than ""char siu"" and the hoison-ginger aioli didn't compensate for the usual sweet taste of ""char siu."" The peanuts were nice but the mint didn't mesh with the rest and to be honest the peanuts and mint were confusing as if it was Pad Thai instead of a ""char siu"" sandwich. This sandwich was doing too much and succeeded at very little. Fries that came on the side were the best part.Maybe I'll try again and give actual breakfast foods a shot or give dinner a whirl but I'm in no rush.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"198,5,"Went for drinks and dollar oysters.

Come early for brunch. Be prepared for a possible wait outside.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"202,3,"Delicious Turkish food, and kind staff.

Best to call ahead when you're close, to make sure you can get seated.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"203,5,The food for dinner was delightful. A little on the more expensive end but for two people a soup (Paca) and a Turkish Hot tapa (Imam Bayildi) and an entree (Iskender Kofte) was more than enough and prepared very quickly. This restaurant serves traditional Turkish food and the vibe and atmosphere inside is lovely. Would definitely love to come back to try the breakfast!,Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"204,4,"I use to live around the corner from this place and never thought growing up in Somerville a Turkish restaurant would open up in my old neighborhood. It was mostly Italian, Chinese, and a bunch of pizza shops. Places have transformed in this area in the past years and for teele square this is a great addition ! Now let's talk about my first Turkish experience, and yes thank you to my fellow yelpers your reviews led us to this unique place and it didn't disappoint at all. Location next to a pub, street parking only and you have to pay unless it's Sunday, Â so good luck with that. Inside is very small I would say about 10 tables some cool art work on the wall but still simple, if it's busy expect a wait but there was no one in here on a Sunday at 1pm which was perfect cause I hate sitting in small places next to people so we were all alone. Service was slow it was two ladies just sitting there talking nonsense as we were waiting to order, like HELLO I am hungry. We finally ordered and than received fresh warm bread with some type of red dipping sauce, should have gotten the name but it was delightful! Brunch was still going on so I got the omellte with Turkish sausage. It was served in a skillet and seems that's what was used to make it in. It was delicious and so different, the spices were something I never had before and the meat was tender. The cheese rolls was good but the way they Â served it was wrong, it was just a pile of phyllo dough, cheese and just sloppy, poor presentation. Overall good experience and will be back to try more good stuff",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"205,4,"I've never came here for lunch or dinner, it was always for breakfast because it's my absolute favorite! Their breakfast is very fresh and tasty. My go to is their Turkish plate (I believe that's what it's called). It comes with a variety of good items. Instead of their boiled eggs, I requested scrambled and it was literally the best scrambled eggs I've ever had.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"206,3,"This place came highly recommended to me, and I was excited to check it out. Now it's a little unfortunate that when a place like that gets a lot of hype, the expectations are raised very high. This sets it up for failure from the start. Kind of like in life you have to keep your expectations for things very low because then you'll be happy more often (when your expectations are exceeded). This is one of the keys to happiness, according to my mentor.But anyways, Istanbul'lu was ok. I got a meat plate which had meat, rice, and some grilled peppers. All were ok. I remember it feeling like a pretty healthy meal too. But didn't stand our very much. I think that the meat did have some complex spices in it which were pretty unique, but otherwise it wasn't too juicy. Not too many vegetables on the plate either. And I remember that it was kind of pricy for this kind of plate.Overall, yes, it got hyped up to me, but I think it wasn't really to my taste. I'll try and give it another shot and try something else.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"207,4,"I came here with my two sisters and a friend during Labor Day weekend. 2 main reasons for coming here for dinner:-Halal -I was craving Turkish food (last time I had it was back in NY during my office holiday gathering ) Since I'm not very well versed with the Turkish cuisine, I ordered what I liked from my previous experience at the holiday gathering. I ordered the sigara borek (filo cheese dough something something) and the Pizara (lamb chops). Please forgive me since I might be butchering the spelling of these dishes, but my pics speak a thousand words , so hopefully it shouldn't allude confusion. Anyways, let's talk food:-Not so much a fan of their filo rolls. It was very bland imo. It felt like bad mozzarella sticks. -The lamb chops really make up for the bad filo rolls. Very tender and juicy. The rice was also amazing too! The lamb chop portions are small but that's the case with most Turkish places I've been to. I'd pair it with an appetizer (not filo rolls) to make it a full meal. The ambience is very nice and calm (bathroom is pretty and clean so that's a plus for me) It's a small restaurant in the Somerville area and I noticed it attracts a lot of students. My sis mentioned that it gets packed during most weekdays, but I guess we got lucky. Quality wise, I say this place is overall pretty good (still prefer NY Turkish food). Price wise, it was comparative to the Turkish restaurants in New York. My sis's good buddy paid the bill for us, which was so sweet! But if you don't have an amazing buddy, do carry lots of dough (not filo dough though. Hehee....)",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"208,4,"Small, cozy, tasty. I had heard good things about Istanbul'lu, and it definitely fulfilled my expectations. The restaurant is very small and casual, so it is probably hard to get a table during peak hours. Service was warm, friendly, and provided great recommendations. The brunch platter was a great dish to share with lots of sweet and savory goodies. I also tried some grape leaves, some eggplant, and a lamb dish with white beans. Everything was very satisfying and I can't wait to return to try more. Baklava, almond pudding, and some Turkish tea was the perfect way to end the meal.

Obviously, we had made reservations in advance. The restaurant itself is very small ( I think, 15-20 seater max) and the ambiance is average (they can definitely do better in this area). You can get 2 hour parking spots around the restaurant very easily. There are several vegetarian Tapas options. We tried their -1. Hummus (comes with a couple of olives on top and is silky smooth texture wise), 2. cheesy spinach- has a very cremy texture 3. yoghurt tomato-y eggplant - seemed like the eggplant was slow cooked. The pieces were intact, juicy and tasted delicious with the yoghurt.4. filo pastry rolls (5)- these could use some sort of chutney /dip and 5. feta cheese cubes (4 in total) wrapped with slices of red bell peppers- this dish had maple syrup drizzling on top which made the dish taste sweet and salty at the same time..delicious overall.Their lamb entre was good but very highly priced. They serve bread and a bell pepper dip at the beginning...these two are delicious! The bread is soft, warm and super fresh. They serve unlimited bread upon request. They have a small selection of wines. I plan to try their desserts next time around! Overall, this is a great, cosy restaurant.. Great for small parties of 4-6 people or a small family. I wish they had more vegetarian entre options..not a fan of grilled / sautÃ©d vegetables. The food is true to it's ingredients, simple and delicious!

Â My friend asked for an iced tea. Â They said they were ""out of iced tea"", yet hot tea was on the menu. Â I asked whether we might just order a hot tea, and some ice. Â The server, with a snotty attitude, replied that they couldn't do anything that was ""off the menu"". Â We should have left at that point. Â I ordered the yogurt ""salad"" for $9, which turned out to be, literally, a cup of yogurt with oil drizzled on top (this was not mentioned in the description) with a so little shredded cucumber in it that you could scarcely taste it, and no spices to speak of. Â This was a ""salad""??? Â By the time I finished trying to scoop out the oil (who wants worthless calories), there was little left. Â And seriously??? Â NINE dollars for a cup of yogurt??? Â This could win the price for the most over-priced item I have *ever* ordered in a restaurant.Next up was the chicken kebab, at $18. Â It was billed as ""chicken and vegetables"". Â  Â The chicken arrive- a grilled chicken breast, quite tasty. Â But the ""vegetables""? Â Literally a quarter of a tomato, sliced in half, and 2 small narrow strips of some kind of green pepper.

There are a lot of options even on their lunch menu, but you picked the wrong place for vegan, or vegetarian food.She ordered a grape leaves sandwich, and I ordered a lamb, and rice plate. The appetizer bread was freaking delicious, and came with a dip that I wish that I knew how to recreate. The bread is also as unlimited as a small, independent restaurant can reasonably offer, so we got plenty of that.The grape leaves sandwich were a disappointment, because the restaurant cut out all of the ingredients that were not vegan. Consequently we just got four grape leaf rolls on a plate, and they called it a day. I hoped that they might make some substitution rather than just serving less food, but no dice.The lamb plate was tasty, but light on substance. It was mostly rice, and yogurt with a few strips of lamb, and potato to mix in. Once mixed, it was more like a stir fry.

But once you find it you'll find a warm cozy restaurant with some amazing Turkish cuisine, most of which I haven't had and welcoming service./ THE SPACE:It's small: most of the tables are for two, and it can probably seat up to 30 people. We've never had to wait for a spot, but it seems quite busy for brunch around noon./ THE FOOD:They start you off with warm bread and roasted red pepper dip, and they are not stingy with the bread! It's important to keep the bread coming for the dishes you'll order, as you'll have a ton of hummus, yogurt, etc., to sop up with it for your main dishes.The menu is broken up into hot and cold tapas, and entrees. There were a lot of unfamiliar terms to me but the explanations on the menu are great (as was google) and the service was really helpful. For brunch, there are sandwiches and salads available.For appetizers, we've had:DOLMA - stuffed grape leaves. Light and delicious, with fresh yogurt.HAYDARI - fresh Turkish yogurt with garlic melted butter -- oozy, pungent, and thick. Fantastic with bread.HUMMUS - also thick and rich. We got too full eating this with all the other dips we have, but if you want fresh hummus this is the place to get it.For mains, we've had:KURU FASUYLE - white beans with tomatoes and lamb. It was delicious and fulfilling, like a home cooked stew. Came with a generous helping of rice -- all for around $10 during lunch!LAZ PANCAKES - for brunch - Turkish pancakes topped with honey, cheese, and jam. SO hearty and rich -- it read more like a dense doughey cake than anything else. I would recommend sharing this.Instabul'lu is sucha wonderful establishment for filling home cooking.

I love coming to Five Horses when the weather is nice, sitting outside, and watching the people walk by. They are always able to accommodate my dog (when the outdoor seating is up and running) and even bring her a little water bowl! The beers are good here - I'm especially a fan of their Sour Beer week - and the food has been consistently good. I always get the cornbread when I go - do yourself a favor and just order it. It comes in it's own cast iron skillet with a big glob of butter. I'm getting hungry as I write this, thinking about the cornbread. I also enjoy the loaded tots when someone at my table orders them, but I never actually order them for myself. Having been here more than a few times I've had the opportunity to peruse quite a bit of the menu and, in general, I enjoy the food. My go to is the fried chicken salad - it makes me feel like I'm making good choices after all the cornbread I just ate! I also like their tacos. I recently had the special taste of Somerville taco and I really hope it makes it on to the official menu at some point!

I was excited to check out this place in Davis Square and was starving for some good brunch. Â We all ordered the mimosa flight which came at a hefty price tag ($18) for four small ~ 3 sip glasses of mimosa. Â Granted, it's my fault for getting a mimosa at a place that boasts its excellent beer selection, but it was all in the spirit of Sunday gals brunch! Â The flavors were interesting and delicious--guava, orange, blackberry, and grapefruit--but definitely not worth the cost.Brunch menu items were the usual suspects with some interesting options, but I opted for ""The Tavern Breakfast"", aka 2 eggs your way, potatoes, and toast because...who could mess that up!? Well, my ""two eggs over-easy with well-done potatoes and rye toast with butter"" came out as two eggs over-hard with cold, mushy potatoes and dry whole wheat toast. The very small portions on the plate looked unappetizing-- two pale eggs (cooked incorrectly), soggy potatoes in a tiny ramekin, and two pieces of toast all for $13. Â There were no condiments on the table and we asked for ketchup and butter three times but did not get it until the end of the meal, which was unfortunate. Â It was incredibly bland and, though I never waste any food, I found myself having a hard time trying to finish this small breakfast plate. Â Overall it was a 1/5 meal.Other girls got the ""Rise and Shine"" brunch pizza and Chimichanga which looked pretty good. Â The Breaky Sammie was doused in butter but seemed to be better portioned that the other options. One of the girls didn't get her meal until 20 minutes after we all got ours because they forgot her order which, hey it happens!, but definitely added to the overall unpleasant experience.

Fried chicken seems to be very popular too. I wanted a classic brunch meal, so went with the 'good morning Davis ' dish, a 3-egg omelette with mushrooms, spinach, roasted red peppers and cheddar cheese. I loved the roasted peppers, but was overwhelmed with the cheese (a little too much, and was overpowering everything else). A little too oily too. The portion was really large and filing. Good I was hungry.I particularly liked the cold brew coffee - not too bitter and quite smooth. I wasn't very tempted by the choices of mimosas in the mimosa flight, but did order a grapefruit mimosa at the end of my meal (quite fresh!!). Most servers are friendly and accommodating.

Â We decided to give this a go after peering at the menu. Â And boy, am I glad we did. Â This is a go to restaurant for us now.The atmosphere is upwardly casual, the menu is far more interesting than a few good items, the service is good, there are TV's to watch your favorite team without the usual sports bar atmosphere. The drink menu is extensive and the menu has a lot of twists to tried and true favorites.

Food is great, massive beer selection (carries 150 beers) and the restaurant interiors are tastefully done. We went here for dinner on a Sunday evening - not too busy and the ambience was relaxed; 90s alternative songs playing softly at the background. Food was served quickly and I had drunken wings, kale salad and tacos - all of which tasted amazing. My only gripe is that they only have 2 dessert items on their menu - not that it changes my rating.",Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"233,4,"Quintessential 4 star restaurant.Five Horses does a lot of things very good and few things great. The beer options are very good and came cold, could be cheaper but hey, its somerville. The food is creative and comforting but the mix of cuisines is confusing. They try and tackle everything from tex-mex to southeast asian to french to american. Some thing are great and others kind of whiff. The burger and fried chicken sandwiches are usually crowd pleasers. Overall, you wont go wrong at this place but you may feel like it could have been better",Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"234,3,"I really want to give Five Horses Tavern more than three stars, because I love the vibe here and the truly unbeatable beer list - but the food experiences we've had have been unfortunately inconsistent.Let's start with the positives - anything here involving chicken (in particular, their FRIED chicken) is usually quite reliable. I still have dreams about the time I ordered the fried chicken sammy here and made the glorious decision to ask for extra honey on the side... it was beyond decadent. On my last visit here, I ordered the French Kiss pizza (apple, brie, candied walnuts, arugula puree, and balsamic glaze), and I would absolutely get that again too.The service here is also very friendly, and I really can't think of a bad waiter or waitress that I've had over the ten or so times I've visited. And the location is perfect - we used to live literally next door to this place, so it became a decent option when folks from out-of-town were visiting and we wanted to go someplace with a sizable-enough menu and a laidback-but-still classy vibe. What keeps this place from being more highly rated for me is that we have had enough 'meh' food experiences here (which is a bummer when the cost isn't dirt-cheap either...) to keep us from being fully-converted Five Horses enthusiasts. Most of the the things that we weren't as impressed with have since been taken off the menu (which I suppose is a good sign...), but one thing that we were particularly disappointed with recently was that they seemed to have changed their roasted chicken recipe! It used to be this magnificent, extra-crunchy delight that took about 20 minutes to prepare (it was worth the wait though!), but upon our last return, the roasted chicken was not the same menu item at all, and upon ordering it, the quality was definitely a big step down from the way they used to serve it.This is one of those places where, if the entrees were each a couple bucks cheaper, I might be more forgiving, but if I'm going to spend close to $20 on some roasted chicken, I want it to be better than average.We'll continue to come back, since a good amount of the food has indeed been tasty, but we're definitely starting to keep track of what menu items we would and wouldn't order again.",Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"235,4,Love this place!

Fried chicken sandwich with tots is unreal!!,Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"236,3,"I've been here a few times and always had a good experience until our most recent visit. Â We went mainly because I wanted to try some of the Goose Island Bourbon County beers that were on tap. Â I got one of those ($18 a pour) and my wife had wine. Â We ordered our food, which arrived fairly quickly (both burgers) and quite enjoyed them. Â They are HUGE and always cooked the way you ordered them. After that, the only interaction we had with the staff was someone giving us our bill and removing our plates and glasses from the table. Â We both gladly would have had another drink, which would have added $40 to our bill. Â And it seemed like they just didn't want our money. Â So we went elsewhere and spent our money there instead.",Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"237,5,"Love this place. This has been my go to spot in Davis since I moved here a few years ago. Great view of TVs at the bar if you're looking to watch a game and the lower bar is great in the spring next to the open windows. Came here to watch the Celtics playoffs last week and the bartenders were super accommodating even though they were slammed. The food is bomb as well. The shakshuka, chicken tenders (order extra scallion sauce because it's amazing), burger and tacos are all great. To top it all off you can't beat the beer list.

I'm sure we got in faster than usual. There is no air conditioning inside, it's crowded, bathrooms are tight...But the food is amazing. We got the house special for 3 people (which means an extra half of a lobster tail, an extra lobster claw, and more seafood for $30 extra instead of $10 for an additional plate but same amount of food). The portions are big so if you're not a starving tourist than I'm sure that $10 plate would have sufficed. To me, it seems that the philosophy of Giacomo's is the food will keep bringing you back.

Â Waited in line outside for a half hour, which only tells you how tired and hungry we were. Â During our wait we bought some homemade lemonade from a little girl selling cups for a dollar - it was some pretty good lemonade, so thanks Angelina!Food: We ordered clams fra diavlo and rice balls. Â Both incredible. Â The fra diavlo sauce was just the right amount of spicy. Â Then we got two pizzas, also good - one would have been plenty, they were bigger than we thought. Â The place was fine, nothing to write home about but not unpleasant. Â We were downstairs right next to the wall of wine. Â I could see where some of the tables would be crowded or right on top of each other but ours wasn't. Â The service was a little bizarre. Â Our waiter was in such a hurry that he took the wrong drink order for my husband (don't get me wrong - he drank it anyway!), and would just drop the food on our table and run away. Â But then when it was time for the check, he was nowhere to be found.I don't remember it being cash only.

CASH ONLY!!! Couple things 1. There is No AC or fans. 2.even on a weekday there will be a line so plan accordingly 3. I would suggest not wearing makeup on hot days 4.This place is very intimate! Okay now to the food I have no complaints on the food we got fried calamari, lobster ravioli and the lobster special and left very full. I got the spicy sauce but it wasn't that spicy so don't be afraid to try it. Stay away from the red wine on hot days! We had the server Rosemary and I liked her style! She was very sweet but had no problem helping you speed things up lol I definitely look forward to trying the location closer to me!",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"243,5,"This place....I'm still dreaming about the pasta and the delicious sauce till this day. When can I go back? Can anyone share the recipe or do a copycat recipe? MUST HAVE. Hands down, best meal I had in Boston. It was FREEZING cold in Boston, and being a Cali-girl, I was definitely not used to snow and face-numbing weather. I really wanted something delicious that would warm my heart and my stomach on my very last day in Boston and I absolutely knew that I had to eat at Giacomo's. My coworkers back home told me about their sauce and how it was probably the best pasta they've ever had. If they're making these claims, how can you not give this place a try?When you arrive, you'll notice quite a long line outside the restaurant. You can't put your name down and you can't wait inside. So the fact that it's freezing cold outside, a 1 hour to 2 hour wait just does not seem ideal. But, everyone leaving the restaurant told me it was absolutely worth it so we just had to suck it up and wait. The restaurant isn't too big on the inside, maybe 10-12 small tables that shift around for larger parties. For two people, we waited about an hour or so, just because the larger parties in front of us weren't ready and they could only fit two anyways. The menu is very straightforward and is organized by the type of pasta you want.Here's the run down:Choose from Linguine, Fettuccini, Ziti, Ravioli.If you choose Linguine, you can pick the type of seafood you want with it: mussels, calamari, clams, scallops, shrimp and even lobster (if they have it). We ended up ordering the special which came with half a lobster tail, clams and mussels over linguine and your choice of sauce for $22. WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. Now comes the sauce, Pesto, Red, Fra Diabolo, Giacomo, Fracomo and Scampi. We tried the Red because that was my coworker's recommendation. Then we ordered a separate order of mussels with Giacomo because we wanted to try the sauce. If a sauce is named after the restaurant, then it must be delicious!The servers here are so sweet. It might seem like they're very straight to the point, but I think they really take their time to make sure you're enjoying yourself. It can feel cramped, but it's because they're trying to sit as many parties as they can. Service was great when I went. They brought us warm buttery garlic bread, and even extra bread when we wanted it to soak up the sauce. He also gave us extra plates and extra napkins because we really looked like we needed it. We were stuffing our faces endlessly. I'm honestly so happy that I was able to eat here and I am looking forward to the day that I return to Giacomo's once again.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"244,5,"Lived up to the hype! We arrived on July 4th at 5PM and miracle of miracles - were sat in the last available table. Service is fast and friendly and the menus are written on chalk boards or handwritten pieces of paper. Essentially you choose your preferred seafood or meat and sauce and voila, there's your dinner. The seafood feasts ($60) looked phenomenal but we opted for the lobster and shrimp special with fra diavolo (spicy red) sauce that was half the price. Got the fresh lobster fix I was craving! The seafood is fresh, the homemade fusili soaked up the sauce perfectly, and even after all the food was gone, I found myself continuing to finish the sauce with the bread and even a spoon. Bottles of wine are $20 - how can you say no to that? All in all, a decadent experience.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"245,4,I had to check out the top Italian resultant in town during my first visit to Boston. My friends and I got there early for dinner so the line wasn't as long. I was a bit surprised how small it was inside and understood why there is a line of people. Our waitress got us drinks and appetizers right away and we look at the board for the specials. I was very tempted to get the grilled chicken special but opted for one of their popular dishes.The Butternut squash ravioli was to die for. I never had anything that amazing it was very mouth watering and topped with fresh parmesan. I pretty much licked my plate clean and used left over bread to eat up all the sauce. The only thing I was not prepared for was the cash only good thing my friend was able to help me out and pay. Afterward we walked across the street to get some fresh italian desserts. I cant wait to visit Boston again to eat at Giacomos Italian restaurant.,Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"246,5,"Why wait 2 hours? Because the food and service is damn good, that's why. Yup waited two hours on a Saturday night, well worth it. It goes by pretty quick too, introduce yourself to stranger and make some friends. Don't let the line scare you. Now to the real stuff. Service is awesome, so friendly and pleasant, feels like you are eating with your family on thanksgiving day. That's the atmosphere I felt. Food is fresh and amazing. The flavors, sauce, everything it's just great. We got the chicken parm & homemade fusilli pasta with lobster meat & shrimp in the giacomo sauce and the antipasto as an app. Our meal was delicious , portions are huge. Everything is just good.

We came on a Sunday at 4:15pm and there was already a long line of about 30-45 mins. Some people managed to get some cannoli from Mikes or Modern (which are extremely close) to snack on while they waited. The food--the house special for two is a perfect choice for seafood lovers. The huge plate came with linguine (we chose the combination lobster sauce) and tons of mussels, clams, and shrimp, with a lobster on top. The size is huge, we couldn't finish the plate with two people. They do charge you extra for the additional people sharing the plate, so it's probably a good idea to order another entree to try different sauces or dishes.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"248,4,"Good seafood pastas with two negative factors:- cash only - no reservations/line up on the curb // LOCATION //  Â  Â  - North End // WAIT+SERVICE // Â  Â  - 10 min luckily for a party of two on a weeknight around 6:30 PM.

When searching for the best place in Boston, Giacomo's seemed to be the place to go. When we arrived, we were placed in a line outside of the restaurant which was said to be about a 45 minute wait. We only ended up waiting about 20-30 minuets, but EVERYONE that came out of the restaurant said it was worth the wait. When we were seated, it definitely had the vibe of an Italian family's kitchen, prepping for Sunday dinner. It's a very small seating area, but I feel like it makes it that much more special (and feels like you're at home). We ordered the calamari (not pictured) and it was probably the best calamari of my life. It melts right in your mouth-I even ate the ones with the tentacles because they were so good. I personally ordered the fettuccine with prosciutto and peas in a garlic cream sauce, and it was SPECTACULAR. It was the closest thing to an Alfredo sauce on the menu, and I would definitely order it again. My dinner guests ordered clams in a scampi sauce, and lobster in the Giacomo sauce. Both were also good.If you're in the area, I definitely recommend it. Do not let the wait turn you off-it's totally worth it, and moves quickly.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"250,5,"Waited 1.5 hours in line starting at 4:55pm (25 min after opening) on a Saturday evening. I would say the food is worth the wait. I think the wait is so long due to the size of the place...very small. This place is real and authentic Italian. You can tell the people that work there are Italian, the vibe is rushed, and the atmosphere is loud. I recommend the lobster ravioli...sooo good! But you really can't go wrong with anything.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"251,1,"The service here is TERRIBLE. I can NEVER go back here. I came with 2 friends, and one of them was visiting from out of town, so I though this would be a great place to go since i've heard good things from other people. The way it works here is that you basically wait in line outside the restaurant til you get a table inside this small restaurant. The meal started out alright our waitress took our orders and then it went downhill from there. Â She got progressievly ruder throughout the meal, was not attentive to refill our water, did not ask how our meal was going and just stopped showing up. This is, like many places around the north end, a cash only business and we were all aware of that yet we only had a few $20 bills on us. When the bill came we asked if we could get change before paying, and the waitress so rudely said ""I don't have change for that much money"" first of all our bill was less than $100 and secondly, this place is cash only, how do you not have enough cash?? She then proceeded, in her rude tone, to say that she can only give change for 1 of our $20 bills. sure, whatever. At this point of the night my entire party was very mad with the way she had been acting, so like any normal person, we left a poor tip. I know servers make most of their wages this way, but you can't treat us like this and expect at least a decent tip. We proceeded to get up to leave the restuarant, and we had not even left our table before our waitress came back, counted the tip infront of us, and scold us for not leaving enough. We were so heated and then proceeded to say we didnt have enough cash and then she had the audacity to say ""I know you have money, I gave you change"" as she was referring to that 1 $20 bill. I had never been so attacked for eating at a restaurant. While the food may have been good, it's definitely not worth the terrible service, I will surely never return to to this establishment.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"252,5,"Can't count the number of times I get asked the following whenever I am on line waiting for Giacomo's: Is it really THAT good? Is it worth the wait? Are you crazy?!.... yes, it is THAT good. yes, it's worth it so shut up and just get to the back of the line already. And YES call me crazy cause I love Giacomo's! Â I keep on coming back here because the food here is superb and the prices are fairly reasonable. The calamari is undoubtedly THE best calamari I have ever tried. Fried to perfection, they add in fried peppers so that the dish has a nice spice/kick to it. I highly recommend the lobster ravioli--the sauce is so velvety and super flavorful and they are really generous with the lobster. You also can't go wrong with their linguine where you get to select your choice of seafood(s) and a sauce that satisfies your palate. Â I can see why many people might have hesitations on coming here because of the long wait, cramped space, and quick turn-around of customers, but Giacomo's isn't deemed a North end staple for no good reason!! So trust me, come to Giacomo's because the food will speak for itself and put your initial doubts to shame.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"253,5,"We got to the north end early and decided to walk up and down the main street. We saw a huge line for this place and looked it up on yelp to see an amazing amount of great reviews. Is it possible this place is all hype? Would waiting in line be worth it? 100% it was definitely worth it and then some. We got in line at around 6:45 PM. The three of us were seated at 7:30 PM on a cool summer night. It's classic Italian affair. Portions are on the large size but not huge. Prices were very reasonable. We started with the Caesar salad for two. It easily could have fed for. It was crisp Romain lettuce, garlicky Caesar dressing, their homemade Italian bread made into croutons and Parmesan cheese perfect it was delicious. The food comes out really fast! We had garlic bread which was the best we've ever had in our lives. We had fried calamari, veal Parmesan with a side of spaghetti marinara And lastly linguine with White clam sauce. Our drinks were a Peroni beer and a glass of Chianti. The bill came to $76! It was more than enough food and we took some home. We even asked for an extra order of garlic bread to take home. I highly recommend coming to Giacomo's!",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"254,4,"Come here, but make reservations. This place, and many of the Italian eateries in the North End, are tiny, and if you're not prepared, you can wait over an hour. This seems to be standard practice in these family owned establishments - no name taking, no beepers, no text confirmations - if you want to eat at Giacomo's, you wait your turn in line out on the sidewalk.After a midday Saturday Sox game, we trekked home to the North End, and we were starving. I called ahead trying to make a last minute reservation, but it didn't work. I was told the wait was about 25 minutes. When we arrived, the line of about 20 people was completely daunting. As we explored other options, we realized that given it was the peak dinner time, in one of the hottest neighborhoods, on a beautiful Saturday night - we would be waiting no matter where we ate. Our party of two split up. I waited at Giacomo's and my friend stood at another restaurant. We decided whoever sat first, that's where we'd eat. After about 40 minutes, we got to skip ahead of larger parties and snag a table for two. If you're coming here with more than two people in your party - DEFINITELY make reservations, or you could be waiting over an hour.We sat at a table with another couple. Good thing they were friendly - that woulda been awkward! Lots of yummy things on the menu, but after seeing our table mates order the Fried Calamari and Burrata appetizer special, we decided to follow suit. Since we ordered two appetizers, we decided to split an entrÃ©e. There's good variety of pasta, sauces, and proteins, especially seafood. And the prices are amazing! $15 for Shrimp Scampi? Yes. We split the dish, and I'm glad we did. After the two appetizers, some AMAZING warm bread (on the house), the perfect portion of Shrimp Scampi left us happy and satiated, but not uncomfortably stuffed (my usual state when departing an Italian place.) The food was made quick and fresh to order. The service was quick, efficient, and friendly, especially given the tight space and crowds they deal with. The restaurant was stuffy and loud, but my water glass was never empty. (If you're claustrophobic, look for a different place to eat) The scampi was fresh, light, and savory, and the Burrata and Calamari was flavorful. We ordered a small order of Calamari, and it was a heaping platter. I can't imagine what a large is meant to feed. It was the perfect amount of food. My only regret is not wearing a bib. I've decided I'm not allowed to order Scampi anymore without one - I always get butter down the front of me!Overall, GREAT value and amazing prices for what you get. Just do yourself a favor and make a reservation. Additionally, I'd avoid driving here at ALL costs, especially on a weekend. Public transport is your best friend in this neighborhood.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"255,3,"Tasty north end staple!I went last night with a friend and we ordered ziti, chicken parm, and a burrata.1) the bread was fine but nothing special. They have olive oil and balsamic which you can adjust to your taste. Â 2/5 2) personally love burrata and enjoyed the cheese with fresh tomatoes. 4/53) I had a glass of wine. Well priced at $6 a glass but served in a warm glass fresh from dishwasher. 2/54) chicken parm- good crusting and served with fresh pasta and flavorful but balanced sauce- 4/55) ziti- I just tried a bite but it was tasty and pasta was the perfect texture. Â 3/5May have just been the weather ( about to rain on a warm June evening) but between being packed and sitting right by the kitchen it was very very hot. Ambiance is nice other than that. It is a great place to go to enjoy good food but not necessarily a date or special occasion. You may be placed at a joined table. This was fine for us, and I appreciate them moving the line efficiently as possible but worth noting. If a tourist - can have someone wait in line and grab mike's pastry across the street for after. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Also very accommodating to a seafood allergy. *tip- go on a Monday- at 6:45 we were told 45 minutes but it was only 20 for a table of 2.

Cash only restaurant so make sure to bring plenty. They give very healthy portions, so be prepared to eat! I ate so much that as soon as we got back to our hotel I passed out from a food coma. I was so stuffed, but couldn't stop because it was so good! Fried Calamari - the perfect amount of crispy and soft. We got the small size and it was more than enough between two people. Lobster Ravioli - good amount of lobster in each pasta and it went extremely well with the sauce. Each bite was just absolute heaven. Â Fruitti di mare - amazing seafood linguine. Very generous portions of shrimp, scallops, calamari, clams and mussels.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"257,4,"Perhaps the hype has died down a little, or because it's a weekday, I was pleasantly surprised that there was no need to wait for a table even at prime dinner time!There are two must-get items whenever I go to Giacomo's, their fried calamari and the mussels appetizer! The small fried calamari here is probably the equivalent of a large at other places, it was definitely more than enough for two people, as we had some leftovers to take home! The fried calamari has includes some fried peppers too, which gives it a nice sour/spicy kick every few bites. The calamari is always fried perfectly, the breading is always crispy and the calamari itself has a tender bite. Â Just found out today that there's a sauce for the mussels that isn't listed on the menu: spicy lobster sauce! It is a slightly spicy tomato-based red sauce that has seafood flavor. No surprise that it went well with the mussels, that were very fresh and well cooked. Other sauces that are good include red sauce and the diavolo sauce. I usually get one of the seafood pastas as my entrÃ©e, and the seafood has always been very fresh, and I really like the red sauce! Tried the special for the first time today: pepper pasta with baby shrimp, spinach, mussels with a creamy mushroom sauce. There was a very smoky flavor to it which reminded me of bacon or smoked foods. The mussels in the pasta dish was a lot saltier and smokier, which makes me think that it was smoked. While I liked how this dish tasted, I probably will not be getting it again because it is heavy/creamy dish, and I was struggling to eat it after the first couple of bites. For dessert, our server strongly recommended the fried apple cheesecake. But I decided to get the tiramisu instead. Besides being a little too sweet for my liking, the tiramisu was delicious! It was also very suitable for takeout, which I did because I was so full from dinner but still wanted dessert. It has a substantial amount of coffee flavor, and you can tell that the cream contained cheese and not just whipped cream.Our server was very friendly and attentive, and she also gave recommendations! Great service overall!",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"258,5,"We LOVE this place. Both times that we have been here, we have waited over an hour and it has always been worth the wait. It is our favorite Italian restaurant in Boston and for good reason! The restaurant starts by giving you bread. This is probably the only disappointing part of the meal because it is cold and I always expect the bread to come out piping hot from the oven but it does its job especially if you've been waiting over an hour to get into the restaurant. For an appetizer, we ordered the calamari. Sprinkle some lemon juice and dip it into the sauce and it is absolutely delectable. I absolutely love the mussel and clams linguine with the spicy lobster sauce. My husband got the shrimp and scallop linguine with the scampi sauce. Both were absolutely amazing! By the time you're done with an appetizer and an entree you basically don't have room for dessert because of their large portions. I'm dying to try the seafood special for two so we are definitely going to be making another trek here to try out that dish. The wait is WORTH IT! It is very easily the best Italian food that you will have and for very decent prices! Yum, love this place, you definitely have to check this place out!

We started off with drinks, my husband had a gin- gin mule which he loved while I had a a delicious strawberry smash. We both ordered the seafood casserole which is always scrumptious.

Waiting times are usually manageable even during busy periods because the restaurant has plenty of seating space. Furthermore, the staff is friendly and service is on point across the board.

They have a great beverage selection but more importantly a knowledgeable bar staff, Â I often order non menu drinks and have been consistently pleased.

Loved the meal and the environment.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"267,2,"It wasn't our first choice, but we were in a rush and the place we initially wanted to eat had a wait. Therefore we settled for Legal. The food was average at best but when you combine that with bloated prices, that exacerbates the whole situation. I admittedly didn't help the situation by making a poor order choice of seafood au gratin. The seafood was over cooked and just sitting in a pool of butter. And I know that an au gratin is generally an oil heavy dish. But this was way over-the-top.My friend also tried to get a tuna burger, and they said they could only serve it well-done because of health safety. Clearly they weren't using quality tuna. I will say the service and drinks were solid though. But at the end of the day, there's many better options to eat in Assembly Row.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"268,3,"We came here for dinner on MLK Day because Legal Seafoods had ""$1 Chowda Day"" at all of their locations. Perfect enticement on a balmy 18 degrees night, and any little excuse to not have to cook was alright by me. I had requested a booth when I made the reservation on OpenTable, the host acknowledged the request, but unfortunately none was available. Booths are across their open kitchen and I wanted the heat coming from that kitchen. However, he was kind enough to sit us underneath a heating lamp (yes we were inside, but it was 18 degrees outside and any extra heat they could give me was better than plain heat).The one dollar clam chowder was steaming hot, but lacked some clams. For a buck, I couldn't complain. Then we had whole-bellied fried clams. Usually they're perfect, but they were a bit salty that night. My husband ordered the Bouillabaisse. Usually it's prefect, but he said the broth was too salty that night. I had Grilled Rainbow Trout. Again, not wanting to sound like a broken record....usually perfect, but a tad too salty that night. It was apparent the cooks were salt-sprinkly-too-happy that night. My Ginger Martinis were the highlight of the evening. Kudos to the bartender who made them for me. Strongest drinks I've ever had in my life. It made the room so much warmer, and my salty trout way more eatable.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"269,4,"The Assembly Square area is chock full of new restaurants and shops, so it's a given that Legal Seafood would open an outpost here facing the Mystic River. Â We stopped in for lunch after catching a matinÃ©e at the AMC around the corner and there were plenty of tables to accommodate us without a reservation. Â The open space with an island bar in the middle and open kitchen towards the back looked semi-industrial, I'm guessing is a throwback to the roots of the area.When you're in Boston at Legal, Clam Chowder is a no brainer. Â Get a mug for everybody, because I hate sharing my soup. Â They have whole belly fried clams also, so gotta get that. Â They're a little on the small side but good, nonetheless. Â Might as well round out the appetizers with scallops and baked oysters and skip the entree for me. Â Around the table we also had the seared salmon tacos for my wife which came with a side of red beans and rice. Â My son was very satisfied with his scallops au gratin special of the day.

I went with my family on a Friday night and it was quiet busy. There was seating by the windows, bar, middle dining and outdoor area. Luckly I made a reservation on OpenTable and requested for a window seat. We were seated immediately upon arrival. Our server was really nice and was able to recommend some great options for us to try. For drinks we got the Sex on The Beach Sangria, Santa Margarita and a half bottle of wine. The cocktails, recommended by the waiter, quite delicious and a good portion was given for the sangria. We started off with the Legal's Signature crab cake, New England clam chowder and 6 of two different types of raw oysters. They were all delicious! Only thing was the crab cake was a portion for two instead of three people. We ordered the seafood lover pizza, Shrimp Fusilli, and Seafood Au Gratin with a ""premium"" side of asparagus for the main entrees. I was not a huge fan of the seafood lover pizza. I guess I couldn't expect much, but it was not loaded with seafood and it has mostly cheese. The shrimp fusilli and seatood au grain were very good. We would definitely order that or recommend that if you want a pasta dish or seafood casserole with a side. Our waiter was pretty busy and came by occasionally. The reason why I am not giving it 4 stars is because there were multiple flies and fruit flies all over our table (see photo). We sat by the window near the river side and we noticed that they left the main door open. Flies almost got into the food, but one sat on the straw of our drink. Luckly I had caught it and showed it to the waiter, but just replaced our straw. I mentioned it to the waiter initially and the manager after the bill was. Neither person didn't really do anything about it, which I sort of understand because it's not like they can be catching flies or something. However, the manager noted that the windows normally open up and today they were closed. If anything I think they should have at least opened the windows the let them go since it was pretty windy outside. Even though I did enjoy the place and most of the food, I wish they were sanitary in regards to the insects hovering our table. I did enough the drinks and the food, but I recommend sitting by the bar or outside if there's a breeze.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"271,1,"The food was OK. This 1 star review is from what I observed of what was going on in the background (near the kitchen) of where the food was being prepped.As I sat in the corner (near the kitchen area) waiting for my food. I noticed the tattoo gentlemen (full sleeve on both arms) grabbing the dishes of veggies (brocolli and spinach) with his BARE hands and portioning them out on each of the plates that were getting ready to be hand out to the customers. It was gross. His entired bare hands touched the veggies. I saw his hands touching the cashier machine, shaking hands with his employees and etc. He did not used any food gloves. He definitely passed some germs on those veggies. I really hope those poor customer will not encounter any food poisoning. Anyways, after a few minutes of observing him, the manager came by his area and I noticed he quickly grabbed gloves and placed them on.I will not be coming back. It was disgusting.

Let me start by saying that I have drinks here at the bar all the time and I have been a loyal customer and always enjoyed being here. My friend and I arrived for a nice dinner after a long day. We ordered our food (shrimp fusilli, bang bang cauliflower, and swordfish tacos) with two drinks. We also ordered one shrimp fusilli with linguini instead of the fusilli to go for the end of our dinner. The waitress, Margaret, said she would check to see if they could even do linguini. Towards the end of our dinner, we had assumed everything was okay and she came over the a bag then stated she forgot to tell them about the linguini option. She went on to say I hope it's okay but I threw in some extra rolls. There was no option given. At first we said okay...I think it should be fine but my friends bf that we ordered for really didn't like fusilli and stated please change it for the linguini. We asked Margaret and she discussed it with her manager. Her response when arriving back was that the fusilli is freshly made at their location but the linguini hasn't been served here for over 9 months. THIS WAS A COMPLETE LIE DUE TO THE SIMPLE FACT THAT MY FRIEND'S BF HAD IT TWO WEEKS AGO FOR HER BIRTHDAY. We stated that to Margaret and she kept saying she understands and really believes us. She kindly* suggested that we ate it instead of him and use it for left over--- how sweeeet of her. I just need to state that this pasta dish is $25 dollars. We told her that it wasn't for us and it was for someone else and she kept asking if we were all set? How can we be all set when we are discussing the options she didn't leave us. I'm not sure if what she told her manager was the truth. At the end we decided to not take the food to go but got the same dish somewhere else for way less. All in all, this situation doesn't seem that negative, however it was presented to us as if we had been in the wrong. Even though we had clearly stated our preferences from the beginning. They made us feel like we were being difficult and had us leaving the restaurant not wanting to return. Don't get me wrong the food itself was terrific and so were the drinks. I just wish we weren't handled like some old Asian women trying to get a discount.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"280,5,Such a perfect way to spend a hot afternoon!

At first there was only one bartender, but again it was quiet. She was lackadaisical and Â quite disinterested in helping people. It took me about 10 minutes get a drink and the only reason I was able to order my food after 20 minutes of waiting, was because another bartender came in to take over half the bar.

We went on a Saturday evening and there was a live band playing the best music you remember from your college days, a plethora of different slumbrew options, and a pub style menu. I had the pretzel (-1 star). The pretzel itself was ok, if a bit small, but the dipping sauces were terrible. The mustard was weirdly sweet and gloopy, and the cheese sauce was watery and flavorless.

I was staying with my cousin this weekend and we brought her kids here for dinner on Saturday night. It was packed and we did have to wait a minute for a table, but everyone here was so friendly and gracious. We noticed two gentlemen having a lean on a table and asked if we could snag it from them, to which they agreed without a second thought. Later we found a larger table and so we handed the tall table to the next people waiting. I love this concept. It's outside, open, and totally chill. The food is affordable, filling, and good value while still being pretty basic. The beer is great, too. I love the toy room and the fact that kids just wander around and no one is concerned. It feels like a neighborhood block party.So I was sad to learn they are closing down this location and opening up a brick-and-mortar elsewhere with a totally different concept. My cousin's 4-year-old was devastated as this is one of his favorite places to go. Hopefully they will have enough feedback from current visitors to realize they need to incorporate as much of their current feel into the new place as possible.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"286,4,"Whether enjoying the summer nights or waiting for a showtime at the AMC next door, I almost always stop into American Fresh to grab a sour or whatever new and/or interesting beer Slumbrew has available.They have some food available (the mustard with the pretzels are killer), board games, giant Jenga and occasionally live music. Puppers and kids are also welcome which helps me rope my friends who are parents into having an evening out.Surrounded by an expanding manufactured environment (East Somerville gentrification weeee), American Fresh holds true to its identity and definitely wins Best of Assembly in my book.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"287,3,"I LOVE Slumbrew beer, and I always have a blast coming out here for Monday night trivia. However, I can't in good conscience give this place a rating of any more than three stars, since my food experiences as of late have all been of below-average quality (while unfortunately also being a bit overpriced); additionally, I've had multiple experiences of them being out of the beers that they were advertising, which was a bummer.To start with the good - Happy Sol has become one of my favorite local beers, and is generally what I recommend to first-timers here who are looking for something that will go down pretty easy. I also do appreciate the focus that they place on bringing in events like trivia, live music, etc. - I don't know if we would have tried this place had it not been for trivia night!But, there are also quite a few things that American Fresh needs to work on. From my experiences, the food quality depends completely on the evening. While the cheddar ale soup (which comes topped with pretzel nuggets) is typically a yummy option here, the last time I had it, it was SO boozy and bitter that I couldn't even finish it. I had a good experience with their antipasto salad a few months ago, but when I ordered it again recently, it was half the usual size and missing a few of the normal ingredients. I also tried their herb and cheese pizza recently, and was very underwhelmed. I had seen folks order some of their other flatbread pizzas a few months ago, which looked delicious, but this one came out looking and tasting like a microwave pizza.I'm looking forward to visiting Slumbrew's other location in Somerville sometime soon, as it appears that the menu there is a bit bigger (and hopefully a bit more reliable) - and with the same delicious beer!",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"288,4,"Whether you will like this place depends completely on what you're looking for.What this place is: - A tiny outdoor beer garden with a pub-in-a-park atmosphere; some tables have umbrellas, others don't. Board games copious.- Baby quotient significantly higher than the average brewery. Lots of toddlers running around, kids on tricycles, a few dogs here and there (there were 2 very sweet and well-behaved Goldens there during our visit). - Can be crowded; seating not guaranteed - if you don't mind finding a corner to stand in for a bit until seats open up, then you're good.- They have tasty Slumbrew beer on tap, served in plastic cups. Selection varies: be flexible about your options in order to have the best time. Current Slumbrew options are available in 4-pack cans for purchase, too.- Very, very casual. Very casual. Did I say casual? Like a bar in someone's backyard. Service is on par with the atmosphere. If you go with that in mind, you'll have a good time.What this place isn't:- A reserved-seating, table-service place that can guarantee a certain experience for you and your group. Don't like little kids running around, dogs, or a super-casual atmosphere? This probably isn't the place for you.- A traditional bar. You can run a credit card tab, but still need to go stand in line again to order every round.- A restaurant. Don't come here to eat, come here to drink. The food is overpriced, microwaved, and not good. If you need a bar snack, that's one thing, but this isn't the place to go for a meal.Personally, I had a great time and really enjoyed this place. The casual, friendly atmosphere made it feel more like a traditional British pub than an American bar, but with cold IPA's, sunshine, and Connect Four instead of warm ale, wood paneling, and darts. There's a specific audience for this type of place, and it will do very well.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"289,2,"Came here last night for a date. The date itself was great, but our time at Slumbrew was unfortunately sub-par.We knew the bar was outdoors, but we did not expect that only around 3 of the tables would have umbrellas, or that getting those tables would be near impossible. It started sprinkling just after my date and I ordered. Since we wanted to sit down and enjoy our food, we decided that a little light rain wouldn't turn us away. Besides, the staff would surely bring out extra umbrellas or a tarp, right?WRONG. The staff did nothing about the rain. They remained in their covered kitchen, leaving the paying customers to fend for themselves. Did they fail Customer Service 101?The food and beer themselves were pretty good. We ordered the soft pretzel and the turkey sandwich with mac n' cheese on the side. I loved the soft pretzel, which came with nacho cheese and dijon mustard for dipping. The sandwich was a standout because of the delicious bread (they source from Iggy's!). I expected the bread to be chewy because of its thick crust, but it was perfect. The mac n' cheese was good insofar as pasta and cheese combos never fail. Nothing stood out about it, though.The rain eventually got to be too much to tolerate. We ended up leaving early to catch a movie.

Her tone and lack of detail appeared that she just didn't want to go through with the effort to do the special.

I had the beer cheese soup, which came piping hot and served with a soft pretzel floating on top. It was incredible. I also got the antipasto salad, which was peppered with pickled, spicy vegetables and served with a tasty homemade vinaigrette. It was more than enough food for me.

We asked the question whether they would continue to be kid friendly with a toy room, and were basically told ""no"" by one of the bartenders.If that's the case unfortunately I doubt we will return.

During the winter it is covered with a large heated tent, you do not feel like you are outside at all. They have live music and board games.

We parked a block away and braved the rain as we and made it over to this beautiful cafe where there was a massive line outside. I headed inside and was greeted by Mike who smiled and asked if I needed a table. I told him yes and that it was three of us, he asked if everyone in my party was present and we were, so he sat us right away. The inside of this place is small enough to be called a cafe but big enough that we didn't feel cramped and we weren't bumping into each other. The layout of the tables offer great space for moving or getting up for drinks (which are self serve for most). Overall we were quite comfortable at our table. The service was great as our server was kind and asked clarifying questions making sure she got our order right. It was quite busy this Saturday morning but we didn't feel rushed at all and the other servers seemed to be working seamlessly with each other to get the job done. Our food arrived and my pancakes (banana chocolate chip) were still smokin' hot! Literally steam was coming off of the pancakes as I lifted them layer by layer!! So delicious so filling and mouthwateringly good!! My sister got the famous macaroon and coconut French toast and I have no idea what my brother in law got but it was all so delicious!! I must add that I took a trip to the restroom and I'm always afraid to use public bathrooms but this bathroom was incredibly clean! It's tucked right next to the kitchen so I was relieved to see that it was clean even on a busy day! I want to thank Mike so much for the warm welcome and the fantastic greeting that is going to have me coming back for many years to come. I appreciate the chef for putting his best foot forward and making a delicious meal that warmed my belly and my heart, and to the servers who were so kind and efficient your hard work never goes unnoticed.

The place tends to get packed but thankfully we didn't have to wait too long to get seated inside (two people). I've been here before and have really enjoyed their pancakes and sandwiches on a croissant. To start we ordered the cappuccino which was alright, not the best quality espresso and I'd probably opt for the refill drip coffee next time. For our actual meal we got a side of bacon, eggs Benedict in English muffin with artichoke hearts (a super interesting menu item), and the glorious morning sandwich on a croissant which consists of fried egg with avocado, tomatoes, and onions. The bacon was super crispy and really tasty. The eggs Benedict were alright, I wouldn't order again as it's not really my cup of tea and I'd maybe go for their banana chocolate chip pancakes which are amazing!!! The sandwich was really tasty even though it was a bit greasy at the bottom. Overall it's a solid crosandwich !I really like this cafe and would probably order the same sandwich but this time try another type of pancake or one of their French toast options. The staff is super friendly and really attentive. We didn't have to wait long for the food either !",Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"302,4,"Love the almost sphere. Very relaxing. Self serve beverage center. I would definitely recommend the Famous coconut macaroon French toast. Servings are very big, but you can get half orders!!! Husband hand the Mexican omelette, which had no meat in it. Over the top on cilantro, so maybe ask to hold that back a little. He said the cornbread muffin was the best he ever had. Tried the banana stuffed french toast. It was good but nothing compares to the FCMFT they serve. I had a half order of the pepper and corn beef hash Benedict. I personally was not a fan of the hash, a little to mush for me, but that is just me.

It's a very small place, so if you go at the wrong time you will be waiting in a line outside for a table to clear (Saturday and Sunday mornings are rough)! When I go I usually try something different or a friend and myself will order two completely different meals and try each other's food. They have good pancakes and waffles and they offer turkey and veggie sausage, which is great because a lot of breakfast spots only offer pork. Their eggs always taste fresh, scrambled, omelet or however you order them. They have a section in the back near the kitchen where you can go up and get coffee and tea and other other drinks, and there's a huge variety for the coffee lovers.

Happy with the choice that my friend and I made for food. We shared the corned beef hash egg Benedict with the in-house grilled mashed potatoes (I believe it's called Omar fries?) as well as the banana nutella french toast. Both of them were scrumptious: definitely enjoy the moderately sweet, non-cloying french toast and the tasty homemade corned beef hash on an egg Benedict.

Be prepared to wait or come as a party of 2!There's ""all you can drink"" coffee, but honestly I only got up once to get my coffee. If you don't want to get charged the ""all you can drink"" price, get the paper cup and not the mug. Sweet pepper and corned beef hash eggs benedict ($17): Hollandaise sauce was unnaturally yellow and corned beef hash was very mushy, like it was mixed in the blender. Fit for a queen/king ($12.50): perfect for anyone who wants sweet and salty for breakfast. My partner ordered fried eggs with bacon and french toast. The french toast was picture perfect, but it was dry. One side of the french toast was dipped in the batter, but the other side wasn't. Very strange.Note: their home fries are grilled mashed potatoes, not roasted potatoes. I've been here before and BSC does a good job with the basics. I would not recommend the eggs benedict though.

Ball Square did JUST that.They have gluten free toast, English muffins, and even pancakes and waffles! I was baffled when I saw these options on their menu. The waitress was very sensitive to my needs and made sure I received a dish that I could eat (and enjoy!).My boyfriend and I ordered the French toast, the Moroccan eggs, a breakfast sandwich on a croissant, diced potatoes, and a side of French fries.The Moroccan eggs were amazing! As was the French toast. The French fries and the potatoes were also amazing (even though they were just sides!). Everything here is delicious, the servers are attentive, and the bottomless self-serve fresh OJ & coffee can't be beat!This place is very cozy and small, so you might wait a bit outside on the weekends, but they're very good about getting your food out quickly, so the wait is never too long!Will definitely be coming back.",Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"310,5,"Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast is the best breakfast bite in Greater Boston.

The ones that had been there before (or before Mike came out to tell everyone) all had steaming cups of strong coffee in hand. The java is self-serve. So while you wait just pop in and pour yourself a mug. It really helps.Once seated inside the small, well Tetrised space, you will get a menu filled with the best breakfast items you will find. All the omelets and egg dishes are served perfectly. The waffles and pancakes are light and tasty. The fruit is always copious and fresh. The Orange juice is always freshly squeezed. They even make their own veggie sausage.I always get omelets. This time I opted for the Mexican. Its 3 eggs stuffed with avocado, jalapeÃ±o peppers, tomatoes, scallions, cilantro and cheddar cheese. On top of that is a healthy dollop of sour cream. It's served with a grilled corn muffin. I got the side of grilled mashed potatoes and the veggie sausage.To say I left stuffed was an understatement.

One of the owners even gave me one of their shirts one day after I came in from a workout.Now I'm afraid as they are getting busier and busier they are paying less attention to the food as it leaves the kitchen.

One big theme was that the sauces were particularly great, and somewhat hidden in certain cases (you had to dig for them in the tomatoes and the squashes, but once you got there they were incredible). The sauce that came with the tomatoes was minty and perfect, and I would have ordered that alone as a soup if that was an option. And the actual soup (the gazpacho) was basically perfect -- I've never had burrata come in this kind of setting, but it was amazing and probably our favorite dish of the night.

I am not asking for fine dining experience but a decent customer experience. 1. Do not mix orders. Invest in a system where the kitchen gets the exact and full order and you don't have receptionist trying to remember all orders. It's frustrating to have your second momo come after 55 minutes of wait. Or to have your veg momo mixed with chicken momo.2. Time - if you know some days are going to be busy, then please keep an extra helping hand. Waiting 35 minutes just to get your samosa-chat is unacceptable.3. First come, first serve - it is unacceptable to have others who came after you get their food (same food) before you. Again, this may be related to #1 above.4. Offer people discounts or free food when things go wrong. For example, do not assume everyone is non-vegetarians in a group. If a group orders a bunch of things, please do not assume everyone is sharing everything. Have receptionist trained so they can ask customers what would they like first on busy days.5. Always send couple's food order together, at the same time. It is absolutely ridiculous to bring one persons order (non-veg) while the other person waits (veg). Again, see #3 above. Couples eat together. And couples may be veg/non-veg.6. Faster service - you are not McDonald and we understand that. But you should try to aim to get all orders fulfilled within 20 minutes. 30 minutes is absolute max. I have waited upto 55 minutes at your place. This needs to be improved or you won't have people coming back to you who value time.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"342,3,I was craving for momos and we found this place near by. The reviews were great and thought of giving it a try. We ordered veg stir fry noodles and veg momos with bottled soda. The noodles were okay but momos were bad. They were bland and steamed too much. FYI- I couldn't find the restroom Â in the restaurant but do ask if you visit. They provide throw away utensils and serve you the food in take out boxes.

My meticulously packaged order came with two sauces, one spicy and the other mild and more tangy - a generous amount to go with the eight momos. The meat is moist and juicy, and the outer wrap soft but not sticky, they were both of the perfect texture! If you think one order is small, you are sorely wrong!

You're gonna be so happily stuffed after a meal at Momo N Curry! The chicken meat itself was a little dry, but the awesomeeeeee sauce more than compensated. It's creamy, without being too rich and heavy. And totally perfect for soaking up all the rice and naan that your stomach can handle!

Basically its a rough version of chinese dumpling. Pass. However these momos are amazing. The wraps are super thin and the fillings are very interesting. I got the spinach and peener and the lamb ones. They are both really really good. Its also an interesting flavor i haven't had anywhere else. The lame one has strong lame flavor which i like and not dry. The sauce is also really good, has a kick but not killing your flavor bud spicy.

The free chai is a nice touch. I liked both the chicken and lamb momo (7.5$ and 10$ respectively) a lot. Tasty and flavorful. The wrapper was a little delicate though -- I think around 1/3 of them had broken wrappers. I didn't think the mushroom curry (13$) was that good though.

They also always have Marsala tea available for free. Service: reliable, friendly, and attentive. Food: INCREDIBLE! Every dish I've tried have not disappointed me. You also need to ensure to try their breads. And try something else other than naan, my choice is usually poori (if eating there). All of their curries are fresh, flavorful and not greasy. I recommend your usual tikka masala or butter chicken. Momo's have many unique fillings to choose from - spinach paneer is wonderful. The dough is very light and the fillings are always flavorful.

The Tikka Masala was very saucy and spicy which are both definitely a plus. I did like that they had free Chai to enjoy while I waited and with the food.The Momos however both times were not that great. I assumed that maybe because that's the dish that is featured in the name of the restaurant that it would be really amazing, but they were just ok, not too juicy or special with the fillings.

The momo options and the rest of the menu are super vegetarian friendly -- we got the lamb momo which was delicious, but there was spinach/peer momo and chicken momo, too. It comes with a couple of sauces that are spicy and not-so-spicy. PLANTAIN CURRY -- a continuation of their vegetarian friendly dishes.

The menu ranges from curry dishes, Momos, rice dishes, and naan. Overall menu seemed a bit more expensive than other Indian/Himalayan/Nepalese places I've been to. We tried the Mixed Momos which let us taste all the different types of Momos. Momos looks like Chinese soup dumplings but taste like regular dumplings without the soup. I wasn't particularly fond of them and they didn't taste like any special.

Literally. I met one of my friends, Raunaq ""Naq"", Â through Yelp last year. After seeing his YouTube video on Bangladeshi food that was taped in Jackson Heights, Queens, I was beyond intrigued. I thought there was no one better who can introduce us to Bengali food than Naq himself. Fast forward last Saturday when Naq suggested we should meet at Royal Bengal. He was there with his lovely girlfriend and I came with my husband. This was the first time I had finally met him. The owner's mother greeted us, and Naq took over from there. Which was perfect because everything described on the menu sounded delicious to my husband and I. Naq also explained to her not to make the dishes too spicy because his girlfriend and I can't handle too much spice. The menu is extensive. They offer both Indian and Bengali cuisines. We specifically ordered from the Bengali Specials. We didn't have to wait for very long for our food to arrive. We ordered 4 entrees to share, Luchi (which is fried bread), and 3 orders of Basmati rice. I have 2 favorites from that dinner: Chingrir Malaikary (shrimp in coconut gravy) and Kasha Mangsho (sauteed goat meat). With all the interesting and delicious food in front of us, our conversation flowed effortlessly. The restaurant is small and I thought I counted 8, maybe 9 tables. If you have a large party, I would suggest making a reservation so they can set tables together before you get there. You can message them through Yelp for your reservation, which I did, and the owner responded right away. Of course don't expect a speedy reply when he's busy cooking. Make sure you do a Yelp check-in so you can get 10% off dinner. Parking in this side of Somerville is easy. Plenty of available street parking on Medford St and the corner street, which is School St. The restaurant doesn't serve alcohol, but you're in Somerville so I'm sure you can find a watering hole to go to after your dinner.

I get into those modes when I just really want Indian food, something savory. Anyway, the food cam super fast and still hot (Love fast delivery when I'm starving, Love when it's still hot cuz i mean....who doesn't) One thing I learned is...if you aren't good with handling too much spice, you need to ask for the most mild type of spice control when ordering. I was so hungry so I left it the way it was; on medium and it was very very spicy to me. I could only eat a little at a time but it was definitely really good! I ordered the Lamb and Potatoes in a curry sauce, that was the spicy dish. It was soooo good so I kept making myself eat more. Next time, I'll adjust the spice level to mild for that dish.

Because you don't come here for outstanding service or charming ambiance, you come here for the best Indian food in town! I judge all Indian restaurants by how well they make my favorite dish: chicken tikka masala. I find it difficult to dislike this dish, unless it's done really terribly. At most good Indian restaurants, it's a creamy, flavorful delight.

Ordered via yelp and picked up. Ordered some roti and kadahi paneer which was their best vegetarian dish when i checked the reviews. The roti was a little too crisp and thin for my liking (which is why the 4 stars) but the subzi was delicious. It was very spicy (i had asked for it) and flavorful.

Â My friend was convinced an Indian grandma made them - they were so satisfying. So far, this is the best Indian food my friends and I have had for awhile - we ordered the lamb saag, the aloo ghobi, the chicken tikka masala, and the lamb vindaloo. We got delivery so the review is based on that alone. Lamb vindaloo was the group favorite: tender lamb heaped in a spicy, tasty flavored curry. When I say spicy, I mean great heat, great spice profile.Lamb saag: tasty. I liked it better next day though.Chicken tikka: another group favorite, amazing for naan dipping.Aloo ghobi: a great complement to all the rest. Loved the curry flavor and consistency of the cauliflower, cooked just right, with enough crunch.I can't speak to the naan - we cheated and had Trader Joe's frozen naan (don't knock it till you've tried it! I will gladly save money on naan over time and order more curry and samosas from here).Lastly, I loved their masala chai - perfection. I haven't had a chai that good in at least 2 years - the spice blend was perfect, and I can't tell if they put sugar in it but it wasn't very sweet - I'm glad for that.

Green peppers and onions were crisp, fresh, and cooked to the right tenderness. Highly recommended. Nothing appeared pre-cooked, including the appetizer. The wait was not horribly long either.The tandoori Rotis, however, left much to be desired. The first round was well cooked but stiffened fast and hit the palate coarse (way beyond how a whole grain flatbread Â normally feels).

She seemed to be a really nice lady. 2 mins into the conversation, the manager of the restaurant (possibly, wife of the owner) started scolding the cook and asked her to get back into the kitchen. She yelled at her for talking to the customers directly. We felt a bit odd after this incident but didn't react. After about 10 mins, the same cook came out and said that one of the items we had ordered was not fresh so we should consider changing it. We were very appreciative of her concern and immediately changed the order. When the manager came to know about this, she went back into the kitchen and started scolding the cook very badly. She was so loud that we could hear every single word she uttered. We felt very uncomfortable and a little annoyed at the owner's reaction. We still didn't react and continued to keep quiet. At the end, when the waiter brought us the receipt, it didn't reflect the changes we had made to the order so I suggested that they should correct it. After making the changes, the manager yelled at the cook once again. The manager (husband of the manager) had also stepped into the restaurant some time ago. He also started yelling at the poor cook and was very rude to her. I was almost scared if he was going to hit her. We didn't see anything but could hear everything.

Your waiter is a young marijuana-addicted hippy who can't tell the difference between an avocado and an adolescent beet.Then there are places like Don Julio.Your empanadas are gooey, yet crunchy, but somehow not oily. Your fajitas are crispy and peppery on the outside, and still juicy on the inside.

The empanadas (filled with chicken) were perfectly fried and not greasy. The tacos came on just-cripsy-enough corn tortillas, with juicy (but not greasy) meat.

The beans and rice were great as well. Â I was not too crazy about the sauce on the side though. It was spicy (which I typically don't mind) but it had a strong fish smell and taste.

I would still definitely come back next time I'm in the area! Can't dock a star for that, though, because the team as a whole was really friendly and have great smiles.Prices were reasonable, too! $6.50 for the pint of Rebel IPA, and only $4.50 for the coconut cake.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"401,4,"My daughter is doing a keto diet and so she needs lots and lots of meat. Brazilian to the rescue. Service here was excellent and the gauchos brought us lots of tasty stuff including sirloin and skirt steak and sausages and more. All of it delicious and cooked the way we liked it.There is also a decent sized buffet line with the sides you might like with your meal, including rices and beans and salads and veggies. I had a few pieces of sushi which were nothing particularly creative (salmon nigiri and california rolls) but were good. I loved the fresh beets and the big fresh mozzarella cheese too.Good service from our waitress who kept drinks refilled and cleared dirty plates promptly.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"402,3,"Oliveira's is a Brazilian steak house restaurant that has both buffet/AYCE and weighted options. The options aren't very clear and we had to ask and verify our AYCE option with multiple people, including the host and waiters. It might be because the staff aren't all fluent in English, but our option was miscommunicated a lot. If you're doing AYCE, here are some tips. Make sure you have the little red/green circle to indicate when you're ready (or not ready) for meat. They'll also bring the meat to you, but you can also get meat from the buffet. (The more crowded it is with people doing AYCE, the quicker the meats seem to come out.) They also seem to have a hard time understanding how cooked you like your meat; when asking for medium rare, I either got very rare or medium (more on the well done side).As for the buffet section, there are options such as Brazilian options, salad and fruit, and even sushi. To be honest, the options aren't great and some of it is pretty mediocre. We're also not sure if the dessert is included, but our flan didn't end up on our check. Some things I did like were:+CHICKEN HEARTS+PINEAPPLE WITH CINNAMON+SIRLOIN+FLANAll in all, the experience was just okay. While it is not extremely expensive for the amount of food that you can get, I wouldn't jump at the opportunity to go again.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"403,4,"Went to Oliveira's to celebrate the engagement of a fraternity brother and his fiancÃ©e earlier that day. The staff was able to accommodate our table as soon as we walked in. I'm sure the reservation helped, but that was still impressive. Many restaurants still take their sweet time setting up a large party, but they were really prepared. All You Can Eat is perfectly priced at $28.99. You start with grabbing your sides at the side bar. They have different styles of rice, plantains, fries, a lot of stuff I didn't recognize, fruits and salads. I'd recommend going easy on the sides, because you're going to want to save room for all the meat that's going to pass by you. When you flip your meal card to the green side, the meat will come in stampedes. Sausages, pork meat, lamb, top sirloin, bacon wrapped chicken, stripped sirloin, THE WORKS. I would've had PETA pissed if they walked in and saw my plate. Not to make fun, but the food was good. Another gem on the buffet is the cinnamon covered baked pineapple. Our table alone may have cleared two sticks of full size pineapples. SOOOOOOO GOOD! The only negative I'd say is that they were slightly being stingy with some of the meat. They'd cut you a small slice and ask you want more. Why ask? Just give. It's all I can eat. Let me eat. Regardless, you'd end up with the amount of food you want, but you may have to ask for more pieces/slices. Our waiters were cool! Checked on us regularly. This place was delicious and perfectly priced for the buffet. I left completely stuffed. I HIGHLY recommend coming here. 4.7 rating from me.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"404,1,"We went to have dinner today, I brought my salad plate and found this, see the pictures.

Â Aisles are tight with inebriated people at the bar backing their butts against your table and backs of chairs.

Â I have to give credit to the meat and table servers just getting around with no mishaps.You have the option of doing the sliced-at-your-table AYCE meat and/or the salad/buffet line with cooked food and BBQ meat by the pound.

I wish this place had a bigger selection of veggies / sides to pair with the meat because I felt that was very limited. Oh and funny thing is when you ask for the dessert menu, they literally bring out a plate of all their options for you to choose from. I've never seen that before haha. Additionally, the restaurant is ridiculously warm...you'll definitely break a sweat there. Back to the steak, they give you this place card - one side red and one side green so when you're ready for food, you flip the card to the green side & waiters will carry a huge slab of meat to your table.

We went with the unlimited option, and I ordered a coconut caprihena (?) and for him passion fruit. The food at the ""salad bar"" was pretty fresh and tasted good, wish they had more options then they did. Meat was brought around to us at the table and overall it was pretty good although there were some meats that were super rare and others that were medium. There was also no pineapple brought while we were here. Compared to Brazilian grills I've been to, there were less options of meat brought out. The coconut caprihena was okay there were lots of little pieces of coconut that got into my mouth as I tried drinking it, wouldn't order again. The boyfriend's passion fruit caprihena was better than mine, and he also had 2 mango mojitos which were delicious.

I stuck with the typical veggies and some of the veggies looked a bit old, but in general the dishes tasted alright. I'm a bit disappointed in the meats themselves, although they were cooked decently (medium rare), it was very inconsistent in flavors. For the most part, each of the cuts were flavorless. What I love the most about Brazilian BBQ is the charred edges and salt and spices coated on the outside of the steak but it was Beverly lacking at this place. The only one that I did enjoy was the top sirloin. The service was attentive and there was always servers either bringing a new meat or cleaning up our plates.

The atmosphere was relaxing. There's less people in the early hours of dinnertime, but as the night got on, more and more people piled into the place and that's when the place became more lively and more busy. I liked how we got to reserve our table on Yelp and just walk right in to our reservation. I noticed a lot of people reserved their tables because the place gets packed real quick. The food was good, but the meat cutters should serve us meats that we want, pertaining to how we want our meat cooked, instead of cutting us meats that were too raw or too cooked for our taste.

To celebrate my graduation from graduate school, my boyfriend and I knew that Field and Vine would offer the perfect atmosphere. The hostess and waitstaff were so kind and accommodating of us, as we arrived without a reservation on a busy Saturday night. While sitting at our table, we overheard a couple sitting next to us remark that this restaurant is a little oasis in the city, and this characterization could not be more apt. We ordered the focaccia, as always, which came with a lemon-garlic tahini spread, the spiced carrots, which were the favorite of the night, the sweet potatoes, and the cast iron cheddar cornbread with a dollop of the slow roasted pork shoulder. While the menu is quite seasonal, if you happen to visit in the near future, we would highly recommend these dishes. We could not be more pleased that Field and Vine is part of our neighborhood!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"421,1,"Would recommend if you wanna post fancy food pics on instagram. Would NOT recommend if you have high standards for food. I went with two friends and asked for menu recommendations from our host. We ordered 6 tapas - fluke ceviche, focaccia with homemade butter and cranberry chutney, apple salad, beef tartare, napa cabbage and mushroom, and braised oxtails. To put it briefly - they put more efforts into plating than the food itself. The first four were cold plates. They were fine, and rather unimpressive. The fluke tasted sour but the meat was not very fresh and rather bland. Focaccia was actually warm and doughy, which was probably the highlight of the entire meal. Homemade butter recommended by the host was unspecial but the cranberry chutney was quite nice. Beef tartare and potato chips was okay. Apple salad had way too much vinegar in it and we couldnt finish. We didnt find much cabbage in napa cabbage and mushroom and it was mostly mushroom. I found it refreshing to add walnuts to the warm veggie plate. But, it was too salty and we couldnt taste the mushroom at all. The same problem with the oxtail - way too much salt. Maybe the chef was feeling particularly salty today, but it just ruined our meal and palate. We all drank like a liter of water during the meal. The date and parsnip cake afterwards was a more solid experience. In general, we only found the carbs - focaccia, potato chips, garlic bread and the crackers that served w/ ceviche satisfying. One common problem with all the dishes was that the flavor of the sauce and condiments was overwhelming, and the original flavor of the food was too faint. You dont want the condiments/sauce to overtake the food. The quality of the meal was definitely not worth its price. Even though the atmosphere was lovely and the host was friendly, the content of the restaurant is still hollow.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"422,5,"I have been to Field & Vine twice in the past few months and both meals were exceptional.

I love that they locally source all their food, and I believe make most if not all of their ingredients in-house (which may be a reason their bread is out of this world), and the owners / chef really highlights the ingredients in wonderful way. You walk away really understanding and appreciating the flavor profiles of individual ingredients in such a novel way. By getting back to basics, they make the concept of farm to table something everyone should try to really understand food as it was meant to taste.I ordered the curried cauliflower, and a whole bunch of other plates that I can't recall because I was savoring all the food like a flavor-drunk fangirl.

I don't think they have anything bad on their menu.A few items that stand out for me are the blank bass crudo, Olives, fried chicken and the gnocchi. The prices are a bit high for the amount of food that's served. But it's worth it because all their items are fresh from the farm And served right to the table. They have a selection of oysters of the day but the offerings are limited and would recommend that you go somewhere else for oysters . Don't get me wrong I enjoy wellfleets and they had two others when o was there but for $3 each I would go somewhere else that has a better selection.For the food, ambiance and the service I am giving them four stars. I can't do five because although we got about 6 items we still left feeling hungry and I guess that's how it is sometimes when you're having farm to table foods.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"430,5,"Arrival: when my Lyft dropped me off, it wasn't clear where the entrance was, but it's actually down a little corridor to your right as you're driving into the parking lot/inlet. Look for a cute green door on your right. The interior is darling, lots of hanging plants, greenery, wood finishes, soft lighting, aka a hipster wet dream (in the best of ways). I was dining alone, so they offered me a seat at the bar, which ended up being a good thing as dining alone can be awkward sometimes and this way I had something to do - watching the kitchen team prep the food in their open kitchen. Now for the food:1. Focaccia, aka crack bread, seriously, the ratio of chewy to soft to salty was fantastic. I tried both the herbed creme frÃ¢iche and the house-made butter - go with the latter. The first honestly tasted a bit like a slightly thicker ranch or something. The butter is the real MVP here. 2. Next up were the grilled beets - omnomnom. The flavoring & texture of the beets and cheese were spot on (the cheese was a little more toasted in a few spots, aka a bit charred, but it was easy to pick around those bits). The basil was a little strange in the mix, but again, I picked around that & was fine. The peach purÃ©e was fire, I just wish there had been a smidge more of it. :)3. For the final act, I got the Cast Iron Cornbread - omg, so, so delicious. Everything complimented each other perfectly - the pork belly was cooked perfectly and pulled apart easily to pair in bites. The melding of the maple & chili flakes was a dance party for my taste buds. Do it. Get it.No dessert, sadly, as I was quite full by this point. Service throughout, from the hostess to server to the chefs, was top notch. Looking forward to visiting the next time I'm in the Boston area!n",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"431,5,"Loved our first visit to this spot. As mentioned, we started with the focaccia and homemade butter...yum! We were lucky enough to walk in without a reservation on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. Perfect view watching the chefs at work. Drink selection covers all the local brews and great wines. We had a maple chicken wing dish which left me drooling and split a broccli tart, a dish we can't stop talking about. We'll be back soon!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"432,5,"Absolutely wonderful! Got the burrata with sausage, beats with halloumi, littleneck clams, and miso-glazed snap peas. Everything was fresh and we watched them cook everything right in front of us. It was art. It was a little bit hot sitting by the wood fire where they were cooking things, so perhaps next time we won't go on a hot summer day. But we'll be back!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"433,5,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Boston. Everything we ate here, except for the clams, was exceptional. The ambiance is so warm and inviting and cozy. The food is incredible; there is a wonderful level of attention to almost every dish that makes the food here a delight to eat. Our favorite dish was probably the chicken wings, which are a Friday special. The next best thing was their hakurei turnip dish, which was the most exquisite root vegetable preparation I've ever had. The gnocchi was a tad too rich and cheesy for me, but I still enjoyed tasting it. The biggest and only disappointment were the clams; these were over salted and tasted awful. Unfortunately, they were perfectly prepared; juicy and not over cooked! We wish we could have enjoyed them.We finished the meal with the pot de creme which was so rich that it was perfect to be shared between two people. The turmeric and ginger tea with cinnamon and black pepper was also a delight. BTW Aesop hand soap in the bathroom... YOU KNOW THEY PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL! this place speaks to my soul.Overall, a really wonderful experience (minus the clams)... would definitely recommend to friends.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"434,5,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here with another couple who hailed it as quite amazing - and I'd say it lived up to the hype! The ambiance is very trendy-California with a sort of earthy vibe. Pretty good wine selection, but a little limited. The food is definitely worthy of praise - we ordered the focaccia and pickles to start. The bread was delicious and came with three spreads (house-made butter, tahini and an herbed creme frÃ¢iche) and the pickles were a nice blend of flavors. For mains, the menu is definitely best for sharing tapas style. As a vegetarian, there were plenty of meat-free options and actually one of those turned out to be a table favorite! We started with the delicata squash, carrots, radishes (with chicken liver pÃ¢tÃ©) and the chicken skewers. Then the second wave included the smoked sausage, crispy potatoes and the parisian gnocchi (which was everyone's favorite - so creamy!!!). Every item was delicious, but the standouts were the carrots, gnocchi and smoked sausage. I pressured everyone into sharing one desert and they were glad for it - the chocolate lavender pot de creme was just the right balance of bitterness and sweet to finish off the meal. Beyond the food, the staff was very attentive and friendly and it was charming to know that the owners are a married couple who were working together in the open kitchen. The wife came by to see how everything was and you could certainly see how her artistic personal style has translated into the food and presentation. A really lovely meal and we'll definitely be back again!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"435,1,"I haven't written a review in years but I can't help but express my frustration and disappointment with the experience I had here. Like every other reviewer, I went with my boyfriend. The atmosphere is cozy and it's conveniently located next to backbar, (convenient ALSO because F&V doesn't have a liquor license). Most of the dishes are served lukewarm or cold (granted, we started off with oysters). The greens in the kale salad were gorgeous but overwhelmed by boquerones: which are much more pungent than anchovies and very, very fishy. I'm not sure why the carrots were prepared ""roasted and chilled"" when they would have been better served roasted to begin with. The accompanying sauce gribiche was pretty much an undersalted pat of egg salad and drowned out the fried capers and arugula. The sunchoke hummus was runny and came with dry crackers. It was ostensibly supposed to include a roasted fennel & onion relish but they forgot it I guess? The garlic meatballs & broth were perfectly salty and tender but I honestly can't believe we were suckered into spending $15 for 4 meatballs. The lamb sliders at Sarma are a STEAL comparatively, and consistently great. Â As I helped myself to a hefty glob of Aesop hand lotion in the bathroom I wondered whether we had merely ordered the wrong things. Did we somehow enter a Shallow Hal type of wormhole that distorted our entire sensory experience? Were we supposed to be too distracted by the wisteria vines to notice how much we were getting ripped off?",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"436,4,"Went to Field & Vine with two friends and we had a great dining experience. Plan on booking way ahead as it is very popular and getting a table between 6:20 and 8:30 is not easy! Our reservation was 8:30, booked a month in advance, and our table was ready for us within minutes of arriving. The decor is hipster industrial and the vibe is cheerful, youthful, and friendly. Â Service was excellent and the wine and food were great. We shared cornbread with a lemony butter, brussels sprouts with cabbage, smoky tofu, and walnuts (yum!), duck confit, and seafood mousseline. All were exceptionally good. This is a small plates restaurant and the plates are on the very small side (compared with other small plates restaurants like Sarma), so order accordingly. They serve only wine, beer, and cider, so as a cocktail lover I was a bit disappointed, but no biggie. The wine and beer selections are excellent. Â And parking in Union Square is next to impossible, but that's just the way it is. We lucked out with parking right in front(!) in the back alley where the door is.This is a well hidden gem of a restaurant and we'll definitely be back.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"437,5,"The interior design is beautiful, inviting, cozy and lovely with a lot of carefully picked flowers and plants as well as delightful lights and kitchenware. The kitchen is an open space, you can see that the chefs use wood to cook and how they prepared and assembled your food. We liked everything we ordered - fresh ingredients, interesting recipes, pretty display. The service is fast and people are friendly and chill. I really like how chill and relaxed the chefs are which made the dining experience better.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"438,5,"We went as a big group the day after they reopened after Christmas break, first the ambient of the place was so cozy and beautiful, it has great tall ceilings and a big open space, the kitchen sits back of the room, the space is not too big that probably fits about 25-30 people and a few more around the bar/kitchen. The menu has almost a tapas feeling with a bit more portion. With first glance, the menu seems so fresh and lots of creative mixtures of veggies, such as parsley salad (have you ever had that as a main salad ingredient, and the dressing was just perfect). I think since we had a huge group we practically ordered everything on the menu. The 3 main meat dishes include the sausage, the steak, the pork and the fried chicken fried to awesome crispy and ridiculous flavoring without even any sauce required. The steak cooked perfect medium rare. The gnocchi was funky and delicious. For seafood lovers the tuna tartare was excellent again with some not too rich but tasty vinaigrette, also another seafood dish to consider the clam dish. Overall the experience was great, the food was so creative and innovative, for you veggie lovers (especially beets) you will love the place. And for everyone else the place has every kinda mixture that meet anyone's desire. And last but not the least, you have to try the pickled veggies...

I've been back something like 6 times in the last month. My girlfriend and I are properly addicted. (Maybe I should worry about mercury poisoning.) I always get the rice bowl with some kind of tuna. The tuna is so soft and delicious. Every sauce is wonderful. And every combination of mixins is good as well. But when in doubt you can safely go by the pre-made options on the menu. Making a custom bowl is more of an advanced maneuver so slow down kid. One downside: the line moves so slow. I would advise staying away at prime time or if you're walking by and see a big line.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"441,2,"The food is delicious, but whoever runs this place needs to listen up. You could be doing two to three times the business, daily, with two more reliable employees on the line at peak times. I waited in line for forty minutes, the food was worth it but I shouldn't have been standing there as long while watching people walk out because of the wait. You're losing business and half of your employees were either late or on their phones in the back.That being said, the classic Hawaiian bowl was worth every single second of that wait.

Because there's already $3.99 delivery charge, I only selected 10% tips through the App. The food arrived one hour and half later.

I live in Davis. And don't have a car. So when I get off the T/bus and want a healthier option that will fill me fast, Pokeworks is there.2. SPEED! Even if there's a line, you can walk through the door and out again with a bowl of fishy goodness in your hands in under 15 minutes.3. TASTE! The fish is so fresh, and you can pick the sauce that it's tossed in before it's added to your bowl. The toppings are varied and very well prepared. All of the flavors and textures mix together LIKE WOAH.3. STYLE! You can order from the menu or customize your bowl with a base, 2 proteins, as AS MANY TOPPINGS AS YOU WANT. A few like the avocado have an extra cost, but there are so many other options that come FO FREE that it's just fine. I like to do half salad/half brown rice as my base to lighten it up a bit, sushi grade salmon and tuna (with light spicy ginger sauce) as my proteins, and then GO TO TOWN with the dried seaweed, crabmeat salad, masago, seaweed salad, and even crunchy toppings like the lovely lotus chips (add one in for the pic, even if you don't want to eat it -- trust me!).4. AFFORDABLE! A regular bowl comes out to around $11, which I think is very reasonable considering the quality, quantity, and variety of all you can add to your bowl as well as the speedy and attentive service. I can usually make one bowl into two meals, so in this case it's especially a steal! If you plan on coming often, make sure to get a regards punch card because with every 12 bowls purchased, you get a free regular poke! And with that, Pokeworks has poked it's way into my heart.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"446,5,"Quick service, great prices, and deliciously fresh fish. The salmon here is so soft and melts in your mouth! Mango is juicy and flavorful, rice is so soft and sticky, and the nori wrap has a moderate presence but holds the burritos very well together. This is arguably one of the better places for poke in the Boston area and the line moves quickly (similar to Chipotle). There is a bit of seating indoors but there's a nice eating area outdoors if you take a quick walk toward the train station.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"447,4,"When Pokeworks first opened up, I've heard that the lines stretched around the block and that the wait time could go over a hour! Now that the hype has lessen some, I decided to try it out. There was no wait around 8PM on a Saturday night.Like most poke places, you can either pick from a variety of poke bowls on the menu, or build your own bowl from what you see in the counter. I opt for a Regular sized poke at $10.95 (Two choices of protein).Protein Choices available: Ahi Tuna (Fresh), Salmon (Spicy/Fresh), Shrimp, Scallop, Chicken, Organic TofuMine was a combo of: 50/50 Sushi Rice and Spring Mix base with ... Fresh Salmon, Hijiki and Ogo seaweed, Chopped Shiso, Fresh jalapeno, Cilantro. For flavor, I went with Sriracha Aioli. My bowl was topped with Seaweed salad, pickled ginger, green onions, garlic crisps and masago.I really liked how they had the proteins mixed separately in a metal bowl before topping it on your base at the very end. The salmon chunks were pretty unevenly cut, but were fresh nevertheless. You are asked if you want a light/medium/heavy dressing and I went with medium, which I think is more than enough sauce for the bowl. Ask them to go a little lighter on the crispy toppings if you want to avoid having a jaw workout during your meal. Will definitely return to try other flavors!",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"448,4,"Took the plunge and came out here (with the help of some good 'ol peer pressure from friends) for Sunday lunch.

Â The interior is very spacious and clean and the tables are nice and wide (though there aren't as many chairs for seating as you would think with all this space).

I wanted to wait a couple months after their opening to avoid that crazy line out the door. The regular size bowls consist of 2 protein options, and a large allows you to have 3. The bowls are definitely more on the pricey side, but they are quite generous with their portions, so in a way, it makes up for it. They offer mix-ins, toppings, flavor, and crunch! My boyfriend and I got similar bowls because we basically have the same taste. We each ordered a large bowl with 3 proteins (salmon, ahi tuna, and more tuna!!), along with sushi rice and a salad. We had the kale, cucumber, diced mango, and orange slices for our mix-ins. For our sauces (the ""flavor""), we asked for Umami Shoyu and Sriracha Aioli. Our toppings were crab salad, green onion, masago (fish eggs), and seaweed salad. And FINALLY, we added some garlic and onion crisps for that extra CRUNCH! As you can see, we filled our bowls to the very top! The only thing I wish they had was EEL! I like that Love Art Sushi offers eel as a protein option. Nevertheless, if I had to choose between Love Art Sushi and Pokeworks, I'd give my vote to Pokeworks because of their excellent quality and variety of options. Please open a store in Chinatown/Downtown :)",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"451,5,"I wanted to come back and give some more details on why Pokeworks is amazing~ I've tried so many poke places in the area and I've gotta say Pokeworks is still one of my favorites. I always get tuna or salmon here as my protein and their tuna/salmon is consistently fresh. For those who want other options, there's shrimp and spicy salmon as more unconventional protein. Great unlimited toppings with classics like seaweed salad, crab salad, and more. Typically, going through the line, I'll get salad/greens with edamame, mango, both seaweeds, seaweed and crab salad and onion crisps. Finished off with a medium amount of bright ponzu sauce!

Not sure why the chicken kabab doesn't have a ""works"" version with fries, but there was plenty to share regardless. The beef shawarma was even better than the kabab, and had just the right touch of saltiness. Fries wise, pretty good.

I got the chicken shawerma plate for dinner. It was just the right size with just the right variety of options: it included the chicken, fries, salad, pita, and a generous portion of delicious garlic cream. The chicken was cooked perfectly and there is some amazing seasoning on there.

Overall a great spot!",Noor Mediterranean Grill,"136 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"476,3,"Noor is a convenient option when you want your Mediterranean food fix - fast. However, I've had better in the area. We arrived at 9pm on a Thursday night. When a chicken shawerma plate was ordered, the man informed us that the chicken had already run out for the day. We could get beef shawerma or kebabs. Beef it is then. We also got a falafel plate. Maybe it was an off night, but both the beef shawerma and falafel balls were a bit off. The beef was dry and lacking flavor. The falafel were overly fried, making them heavy and very hard to cut. The fries and salad were nothing special. The rice was pretty good, as were the hummus and YES to the tangy garlic sauce (although be warned: your breath WILL still smell like it the next day). It was also very hot inside, as there is no A/C and just one fan running in the back. And there's no tap water available (you can only buy bottles), so I wouldn't necessarily eat inside again. A good option would be to get it to-go and eat outside in Powderhouse Park. But a better option would be to just go somewhere else.",Noor Mediterranean Grill,"136 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"477,5,"The food is tasty, fresh and feels healthy. It's always pretty consistent, I've had the steak shawarma, chicken swarma, and chicken kabob. All are good options depending on what you're in the mood for. Â Sometimes the swarma can be a tad dry, but still tender and flavorful. Extra star for great customer service. They made a mistake on my delivery order and it took over 90 minutes to arrive.

Conde Nast had this spot on their ""best in the world 2015"" list and it consistently ranks highly as a top spot for vegetarians. I can see why. For starters, make a reservation. The place isn't very big and it's pretty popular, especially during the summer, because they have a pretty extensive outdoor eating area. We went on a Wednesday night around 7pm, and waited for about a half hour prior to getting seated. They kindly got us drinks and some small plates while we waited for our table. They don't serve hard alcohol, but have a very extensive list of wines and champagne, and also make fun, seasonal, wine-based drinks.I believe the menu rotates, but I think some of the popular dishes are always available. We probably ordered about 3-4 plates per person (table of 6) which came out to be a bit much, and resulted in food getting wasted at the end of the night.Everything was EXCEPTIONAL. The standouts were definitely the Whipped Feta, Fatteh, Lemon Chicken, and Lamb Lamejun. The pita was great as well. My personal favorite was either the stuffed shells or the falafel. I LOVE falafel and this might be the best I've ever had. Warm, crunchy, tasty and soft, all at once. That is a must-have.Bottom line: I haven't been to Giacomo's, in fairness, but I have been to Lolitas and Atlantic. This place takes the cake for me as best in Boston. 200% will be back.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"482,3,"This is my favorite restaurant. Start with the Feta and Pepper Spread. Always go with the Vegetarian Dinner. I'm not a Vegetarian, but the dishes included in this dinner are always spectacular. If you can save room for dessert, the Baked Alaska is phenomenal. The passion fruit touch is genius. The service here has never been anything less than professional, yet at the same time, warm and gracious. Updated Review 07/31/18A friend of mine was visiting Boston last week. I highly recommended Oleana, and they decided to visit on Tuesday night 7/24. They only had time for one ""date night"" during their visit. They trust me with my Restaurant recommendations, and I even advised them to order the vegetarian dinner, as I had always ordered it and it was beyond fantastic. When they returned from their trip, I asked about their dinner. They hesitated, and told me that their dinner was a disappointment. Their food was very ""Ok"", but nothing beyond that. I was flabbergasted and embarrassed that I had recommended it! They could have gone anywhere. I was perplexed by this, and couldn't imagine how their dining experience could have been so mediocre. I realized that it had been a few years since I visited the Boston area. In that time, could the restaurant have gone downhill? Surely Ana Sortun couldn't possibly have been cooking that night! One of the waiters suggested to them that it depended on who was cooking. Really?!?? Is it the management of the place? What has happened to my previously very Favorite Restaurant???? I know this. I will be hesitant to recommend it in the future. I'm so sorry that this restaurant is obviously experiencing problems concerning quality. Such a shame",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"483,4,"Had reservations for 7 P.M. We arrived a little early and were quickly sat in a nice, secluded table in the corner. The special ran out at 7, a few minutes after or waitress told us about it. That was a gut punch. The house bread was seasoned with za'atar and came with olive oil. It is an acquired taste. Some may not like it, especially since it is cold. It had a similar texture to cornbread. We were served three pieces but only ate two. The food started coming out soon after or order was taken. Our water was filled repeatedly, and we were checked on several times. The way the dishes were explained to us as they came out one after another reminded me of omakase sushi. The first dish that came out was the fatteh. Caramelized Onion, Cauliflower, Crispy Mushrooms, Pinenuts, Yogurt. It was nice and warm with a variety of textures and flavors. It contained many ingredients that were skillfully combined and worked well together. This was my favorite dish of the night. Next came the spinach falafel. Tahini Sauce, Beet Yogurt, Cress. We were asked if we wanted four falafel sandwich instead of three since there were two of us. That was thoughtful. This wasn't as good as the fatteh, which was a very hard act to follow. The pickled vegetables added to it by breaking up the taste a little. I got this due to the very many positive reviews about it on yelp but was not impressed. Next was the squid Kokorec. Garlic Bread, Green Chile, Cherry Tomato, Cumin, Oregano. The squid was perfectly cooked. I liked it a lot, and I don't really like squid or pesto. I would get this again. Finally, we had the Sultan's delight. Tamarind Beef, Smokey Eggplant PurÃ©e, Pinenuts. This one took a long time to come out. When it was brought out the server had three more of them to deliver to other diners. Perhaps there is something about the way that it is prepared that takes time. It reminded me of bbq. Very tender, melt in your mouth. There were some super tasty fatty parts too. I would also get this again. This was another dish that many on yelp recommended. Our server then patiently explained the dessert menu. Went with the goat milk ice cream. Roasted Strawberry, Persian Love Cake, Almond, Strawberry MarasMallow. I liked the taste of the ice cream. It was quite refreshing. The almonds were good too. Don't eat this yourself. It is suited for two. The cake part of the dessert seemed a little too sweet. I would not get this again. Based on other yelp reviews and my own personal experience, dessert may be their weak point. We really enjoyed our experience at Oleana. The service was second to none, and the food very tasty and daring. I recommend doing what we did and just ordering mezes. We got four and a dessert, and that was more than enough for us.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"484,5,"Oleana Restaurant was the most expensive restaurant I visited during my short weekend trip to Boston and I gotta say it was worth every penny. Executive Chef Ana Sortun is a six-time James Beard semifinalist for Outstanding Chef & also won the Best Chefs in America award in 2005. In addition, Executive Pastry Chef Maura Kilpatrick is a seven-time James Beard semifinalist for Outstanding Pastry Chef. You heard it - two James Beard nominees all under one restaurant! I booked a table through the Reserve platform three weeks ahead of time and got 8 PM time slot, but their bar seats and garden patio are first-come, first-served. After we arrived to the restaurant, the staff seated us within the next five minutes. You know the restaurant is really popular when chefs write and sell their own cookbooks (e.g. ""Soframiz: Vibrant Middle Eastern Recipes from Sofra Bakery and Cafe""). There are so many items on the menu that I felt pretty overwhelmed, but luckily the bottom of the menu got a glossary to explain certain dishes and Yelp review highlights were also extremely helpful.***Complimentary bread: Tasted slightly funky, and I am not exactly a fan. However, save some bread just in case you are still hungry at the end of the meal. Save your stomach for their Ã  la carte items!Spinach Falafel (Tahini Sauce, Beet Yogurt, Cress - $13): You get three of these heavenly falafel! This dish simply took the entire flavor profile to the next level - creamy texture combining with very distinct aroma = one delicious experience!Sultan's Delight (Tamarind Beef, Smokey Eggplant PurÃ©e, Pinenuts, $15): The level of tenderness and melt-in-your-mouth level were absolutely unreal. I could probably finish the entire dish in two bites, but I did the exact opposite - I savored every bite.Lemon Chicken (Za'atar, Turkish Cheese Pancake, $27): The quality of chicken was unbelievable - moist and tender chicken!!! Yes cream cheese tasted a bit greasy, but the entire chicken skin was covered with a layer of Za'atar and Za'atar created this unique flavor profile that you simply can't find in most other Mediterranean restaurants.Grilled Pita (Red Pepper, Pomegranate Molasses, Nigella Seed, $3): A bit like mini flatbread pizza without any cheese and toppings.Warm Buttered Hummus (Basturma, Tomato, $6): Potato-like texture with a hint of star anise flavor. I thought hummus was okay and it was the least memorable order of the night.***Overall it was an eye-opening dinner and I feel like each dish had its own unique characteristics and personality. The three dishes (Spinach Falafel, Sultan's Delight, Lemon Chicken) are essentially must order items and don't commit too many orders because lemon chicken was very filling (consider sharing just one entree so you'll have room for desserts). Sadly I was too full and did NOT get to try their famous Baked Alaska (with Coconut Ice Cream and Passion Fruit Caramel). This is hands down one of the best Mediterranean restaurants that I have ever tried.P.S. - Oleana also has two sister restaurants called SOFRA Bakery & Cafe and Sarma in the Boston area.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"485,5,"I went seafood crazy on this trip to Boston, but this was a nice break from lobster rolls and oysters. It is a celebration of Mediterranean and Arabic cooking that takes you all over with a great assortment of mezze. We had a cute corner table near the wine bottles in the corner and shared 4 plates and a dessert. The server suggested 4-6 and I would agree. The olive oil laden bread with za'atar was wonderful and the quality of the oil was spectacular. I was excited for the meal. They had a shrimp mezze that was sold out, but I opted to sub the kefte-I was not disappointed. This was the shining dish of the night despite the rave reviews for sultan beef and spinach falafel. It was tart, soft, crunchy-just an unbelievable dish. I wanted a second one, but more was coming. The falafel were nice in texture and the beet purÃ©e was sweet, but it wasn't my favorite and tasted lightly seasoned after the kefte flavor bomb. The next item was the squid. This squid was delicious with a light sauce of olive oil and saffron with cherry tomato. The sauce was heavenly and the texture of the squid could not have been better. The sultan beef dish followed and it was the most surprising. It tasted like sweet beef barbecue. Seriously. It was soft and coated in a sweet/tangy glaze and was melt in your mouth tender-but it tasted like a really good bite of BBQ beef. I will let my bf handle the dessert review, but I will say-if you see something with goat cheese ice cream, get it. So delicious.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"486,5,"Delicate appetizers and ambrosial main courses.We had the lamb tarts and the beef one to start with(I can't remember the name). The beef appetizer is great. The beef itself is very soft. It is not like a ""steak"". You don't need knives to slice it. Just pull it apart with forks.The lamb tarta has a little spicy taste. In addition, they add some flour product inside the tarta. It tastes like small pieces of pasta which makes the lamb meat more outstanding.For the main course, scallop is definitely a good choice. Most places overlook scallops so that they become chewy and hard to swallow. However, the scallops here are like soft jellies. We had the classic dessert ""Baked Alaska"". The well scorched marshmallow contains a scoop of ice cream and a piece of cake inside. They use passion fruit sauce at the base to provide a sour taste in order to neutralize the sweetness.The only deficiency is that the bread and the veggie side we had are too salty and bitter.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"487,5,"Oleana is such a beautifully done restaurant with wonderful food and service. To be honest, it was the first time I've had this type of Mediterranean food and I was pleasantly surprised. The menu has a combination of small tapas-style plates and entree plates. We opted for the small tapas (meze) to try more foods.They suggested 2-3 a person and we were happy to oblige.+SULTAN'S DELIGHT: Â The beef is incredibly soft and flavorful. It comes with a basil leaf on top and I would definitely recommend having parts of the leaf with the beef. It goes so well together.+FATTEH: A really great combination of flavors. I especially like the crispiness of the ""bread,"" and in combination with the other ingredients make it quite texturally pleasing. The crispy mushrooms and caramlized onions give it a savoriness that compliments the yogurt. +SPINACH FALAFEL: The falafel is so moist and crispy on the outside, and the tart beet yogurt is a perfect condiment.+VERMONT QUAIL KEBOB: Softest quail I've had, though I should preface I haven't had many. The rice is slightly crispy on the bottom which adds a nice texture.-BAKED ALASKA: I haven't had too many but not sure if you could go wrong with this. While the menu says the ice cream inside is coconut, it didn't seem that way to me. Furthermore, the passionfruit syrup tasted almost too sweet but it worked out okay with the rest of the dish (just don't eat it on its own). I'm a fan of different temperatures of my food and this was no exception with the warm meringue and cold ice cream. -WARM BUTTERED HUMMUS: My least favorite but it wasn't bad. The hummus is not the hummus that I'm used to, and on the drier side (kind of reminded me of bean paste texture of Asian desserts). The restaurant seems popular and I would recommend reservations, though it seems that people can get lucky if you go right at opening. As for the restaurant itself, the tables are a little close together, and the bathroom is small, but not in an off putting way. They also have an outside area that's open when weather-permitting. As a walk-in, we got seated here, though a warning that it gets pretty dark out there. All in all, Oleana was a great experience and I would not hesitate to return. Definitely a gem of Boston!",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"488,4,"We dined at Oleana on a Thursday night and it was packed! Reservations always recommended here.My biggest let down is that they don't have a liquor license so they only serve beer and wine. However, our waitress was very pleasant and the food was great. We weren't overly hungry so we chose 3 mezzes to share. We had the quail kebabs which were awesome, the moussaka which was even better, and a special carrot soup with a fish cake. Those 3 were plenty to fill us both and it was all delicious.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"489,5,"I can never praise Oleana enough. My husband and I rented out Oleana last May to host our wedding. Throughout the entire process they were extremely accommodating, communicative, and knowledgeable. More importantly we have an extremely limited budget, and found Oleana, one of the BEST restaurants in the Boston area, to be more affordable than many other venues and caterers. Space Fee is $1,500. Family-Style Menu is $65 per guest. Â All of my guests left complimenting the food. So, needless to say if you haven't dined at Oleana yet I'd recommend making a reservation and getting in as soon as you can. The garden patio is my favorite spot in the summer. If you are food curious, I'd recommend making a meal out of Â mostly mezes (think tapa size) with perhaps just 1 entree for a protein option. The menu changes a bit throughout the seasons. Â However my favorites are the Spinach Falafel, any octopus/duck variation, Sultan's Delight, and any borek. Even for tradition items that might not excite you give it a try at Oleana because I've found they prepare the dishes with really interesting twists and surprising combination of flavors.

That way, I can enjoy as many different flavors as possible. The Sultan's Delight and the Lamb and Grape Leaf Tart are two of my favorites.If you're there in the summer, ask to sit in the backyard!

Our waitress walked us through the different ways to order (e.g. all small plates vs 2 small plates per person and a shared main course vs. each get a main course and share an appetizer), and since all the appetizers sounded so amazing, we decided to go four 4 small plates and then share a main.We tried the sultan's delight, lamb and grape leaf tart, octopus, and a soft shell crab special, and then split the chicken. Everything was fantastic, with multiple layers of complex flavors ranging from sweet to savory. The sultan's delight and soft shell crab stole the show though - the sultan's delight was a tender, fruit glazed short rib, paired with a fantastic whipped dip, and the soft shell crab had this incredible fruit and tahini salad that it came with. Delicious. We were practically licking the plate. While the octopus and lamb and grape tart were good, they just didn't have the same effect on us. The octopus was actually a little salty for my liking, and I love salt.The lemon chicken was also delicious, and the zaatar seasoning was great. The meat was served on top of a rich, feta stuffed crepe that still tasted light and refreshing despite being anything but a ""light"" component.The only thing that left us a bit unsatisfied was the service - while it was great at the beginning, we started feeling very rushed and as though we were being shoved out the door by the time we were finishing up our main course. While I understand how busy the restaurant is, when you have people paying a decent amount to dine at your establishment, you shouldn't be grabbing plates left and right and hustling for the check to be paid so that you can get the next people in...NOTES:(1) Be sure to make a reservation because theres always a wait even after.(2) If you are a vegetarian this place is for you. Â They have a vegetarian tasting menu.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"499,3,"Four of us had dinner here recently and overall I feel a little disappointed. Based on the reviews I was probably coming into it with unrealistic expectations but as my review will detail, I have my reasons.My wife and I got there about 15 minutes prior to our reservation time, and were waiting for our friends. While we waited it would have been nice to have a drink at the bar, but apparently they only allow people in the bar area based on the number of seats, so we were told we could wait on a bench that's next to a server station. They did get us drinks from the bar, so it wasn't too bad. One thing I didn't know was that they only serve beer and wine - no hard liquor. We were sat at a table and soon had placed orders for a number of mezes, followed by a couple of entrees. The mezes ranged from delicious to merely meh. The grilled pita with red pepper, pomegranate molasses, and nigella seed was a soggy, cold plate of pita covered in red liquid that didn't seem grilled or taste of pomegranate. The warm buttered hummus was very good, the quail was ok, the moussaka was excellent. It should be noted that these mezes are really small, about two bites, other than the pita, so you don't have much to share. We also got one of the specials of the night, which was left unfinished.Entrees were scallops and gyros. Small, nicely plated, but underwhelming in flavor. I think the restaurant is a bit full of themselves. There's a lot of very good food, but it seems to be matched by dishes that aren't very good. It may be the execution or the concept of some of these lesser dishes, I'm not sure which but with the expectations set by the restaurant itself and the reviews, it all seemed like a bit of a let down. Service was ok. Some servers were better than others and it was a bit scattered as far as who was taking care of us. At least 4 different people brought out plates or removed them. We had to point out several times that the empty beer cans could be taken, which seemed obvious as they were crowded together on the edge of the table.One other thing, which wasn't an issue for us but could be for anyone in a wheelchair, is that the bathrooms are tiny - absolutely not ADA compliant.

We highly recommend ordering this. We also ordered the carrot salad starter also quite good.For entrees we both ordered the m-roustia. A lamb shank tajine with almonds, raisins, sesame seeds, and spices. Â Again it was fantastic. We ended up breaking up the bread and soaking up the sauce in the tajine. I would definitely order again.Staff are very friendly. I will point out that they do not have many staff members. If it is busy and you are in a big hurry, this may not be the place to visit. We will definitely be back when in the Somerville area again. I highly recommend if you are in the mood for Moroccan food.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"503,5,"Oh I'm so glad I found this place.

Without knowing exactly what would be authentic, this certainly feels authentic to me, in decor, food quality, and hospitality, not to mention being a very relaxed atmosphere.Your meal begins with nicely steeped mint tea, bread, and a dish of brined cabbage. The food, which came out quickly this evening, was what I expected in terms of texture and taste. Our chicken bastilla appetizer had that combination of texture including ground almonds, the fruity undertones, and the powdered sugar on top. Â The meat in our entrees was equally complex in taste, and the lamb on the lamb shank for the M-Rouzia entree came right off the bone. Save some bread for sopping up the juices.

It feels cozy and the couch with pillows is really inviting. There were not too many people so it was nice and quiet and we could really enjoy the food.For appetizers, we got the Chicken Bastilla (amazing) and the Vegetarian Cigars (so crispy and good!) The Chicken Bastilla is an absolutely unusual dish, flavors which I never had before combined together. It is like a baked chicken pastry, topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. The flavors go together superbly well, the sweet and savory are very well balanced. The Vegetarian Cigars were also really good. There's a slight hint of citrus flavor in the filling which I liked. But what really stood out was the dough - it was baked completely perfect, and very flaky, hot, and delicious. I noted to my finacee that no matter how many times we might practice making something like this at home, there is no way we would ever get it to such a level. Really amazing.The entrees were a real treat as well. We had the Beef Tajine and the Lamb Tajine. The Lamb Tajine is absolutely unreal. It fell off the bone and the flavors with the ginger sauce and almonds were fantastic. I would go back here just to have this dish again. The Beef Tajine was great too - cinnamon flavor sauce with tasty onion and tomato.All in all this was an amazing dinner and I look forward to eating here again!",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"507,5,"This was the second time I've come here.

I do not doubt that. What I will say is that I made a trek to this place only to be greeted by someone very rudely, with seats clearly opened, telling me they didn't cook enough food for us. Their plan is taking reservations and basing how much food is cooked on this, according to the person that greeted. Now if nothing else, this doesn't sound like good business. It's certainly horrible customer service. I also called them ahead of time to ask if reservation was needed and I received no response.I'm sorry but I've been to some great great restaurants in this city and never heard this. I guess they're secretly the greatest restaurant in history to have such pride.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"511,5,"This place is so delicious and filling for your buck!

Â Come give it a try!",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"512,2,"My family is a huge fan of Moroccan food--the beautiful bastillas, the couscous, the wonderful tajines. We once went to a small Moroccan restaurant in a strip mall in Southern California where the owner sprinkled rose water on us at the end of a wonderful meal. We have dined on Moroccan cuisine in Paris and London and have never been disappointed. Plus, I have never met a person from Morocco who was not the epitome of hospitality. I'm on a perpetual quest for great Moroccan food. I was so hoping to like this place. Small, local and run by a family rather than a restaurant chain. And it was not very expensive and I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, we won't go back. I heard they moved from Malden to Somerville so hopefully they will find some fans and improve. First off, food wise, the only item that was tasty was the chicken bastilla. The chicken M'hammer was nothing special. The chicken itself was dry and largely tasteless. The lamb rouzia was okay but there was not much meat for the dish. We ordered the roasted eggplant salad which came with some bread but the waitress did not suggest we order any couscous. We did order couscous but it was a tiny side dish which 3 people share. Â  The food overall was unremarkable. Second, the restaurant is so dark! No candles on the table to help you see just a bit. There are wall sconces covered with red or orange glass so it makes it super dark. The music and the sound system was pretty dreadful. I think they were streaming from a tablet or cellphone and it was traditional Moroccan music rather than the more contemporary music that is kind of poppy. Why? Seemed so dated and unnecessary.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"513,5,"Great, attentive service, authentic and intimate ambiance, and portions were plentiful and tasty - would recommend for a change-of-pace date night or small-group dinner, especially on a weeknight!",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"514,5,This place is gold.

I'm coming back every time I get a chance.LOVE LOVE LOVE!,Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"515,3,It was my first time eating Moroccan food so maybe we didn't know the right combinations to order... The only thing I would recommend is the lamb dish and everyone at the table agreed. The chicken bastilla was sprinkled with powdered sugar and the couscous had sweetness from the raisins. The food just wasn't to our liking because everything was TOO sweet. The service was good and the atmosphere was excellent though!,Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"516,4,"So, I developed a thing for Chicken B'stilla ever since I first enjoyed the appetizer at Tangierino in Charlestown. Â A wish to recreate my memories of that tender, flakey, savory yet cinnamony dish led me to Baraka CafÃ© in Central Square. Â But hopes were dashed as theirs did not compare.I first became aware of Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant when I did an online search of chicken bastilla in the area, back when they were located in Malden. Â So once they moved to Somerville in 2014, I became ever more hopeful of the opportunity to one day visit them and to sample their chicken bastilla.Well, one day finally came. Â I grabbed a cohort in consumption and headed on over early one Friday eve. Â Their menu was unlike the one found online, but at least the longed for chicken app was still there.The Almond Shake (with orange blossom water, raisins and dates) $5.99 resembled a milk shake with its frothy top. Â It arrived in a rather small goblet, but the flavor made the portion plenty. Â I'm glad I tried it, but it wasn't to my taste. Â Maybe I'm just not an orange blossom water kind of girl.A nice sliced yellow bread arrived with an olive spread along with the Chicken Bastilla $7.99 (chicken and almonds wrapped in phyllo dough baked to perfection), a domed phyllo wrapped concoction decorated with a dusting of powdered sugar and cinnamon. Â The phyllo was crisp, thin, and delicate, the filling dense and tasty. Â My DC loved it, as did I, though I suspect still that Tangierino's version might still be number one in my heart of hearts. Â It was plenty to share as an appetizer for 2-3, though I could have been happy consuming it all on my lonesome.For our entrees, we elected to share a hot dish and a sandwich. Â The Brania sandwich $7.99 (slow cooked braised beef served in Moroccan flat bread and fried eggplants) arrived as a half loaf of the same bread, sliced open into a pocket like a pita, and filled with tender beef and soft eggplant. Â The Lamb Couscous with Vegetables $16.99 was a generous portion. Â A meaty leg and large chunk chopped vegetables topped the plate of couscous. Â The lamb was tender but rather gamey, the vegetables retained a nice bite, but it wasn't the most flavorful dish.Dinner was good, but we were in agreement that the sole dish worth a repeat was the chicken bastilla. Â Sadly, they do not offer dessert.Service was personal and friendly. Â The dining room warm and inviting, and cushion-filled.The walk from the Porter Square T stop was convenient on a nice day, as was street parking just outside the restaurant.3.5 stars.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"517,4,"Went here on a snowy Friday night and ordered a number of dishes whose exact names now elude me. Everything was delicious (especially the hummus served with the bread, and the beef makfoul) except the roasted chicken, which although not bad was surprisingly bland in comparison to the other dishes. The atmosphere is great-- very cozy. If they only offered wine though! Still, it's a nice little place tucked into a corner of Somerville that is otherwise something of a restaurant desert. Check it out.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"518,3,"I have been in Moroccan Hospitality twice in the span of the last 2 years. I am Moroccan, born and raised in Morocco and have family who are in the business of cooking and hospitality back home. For a place called Moroccan Hospitality, it was not hospitable at all. The woman running the place is really rude. The first time I went ( during the fasting month of Ramadan), she offered me the Ramadan fasting menu to start with (13 dollars). I came with a friend who wasn't fasting so we decided to just order ordinary dinner dishes... She refused to serve us the regular menu (while all the other people in restaurant were having regular dishes from the menu). She said she has to first serve the Ramadan menu and that the dinner menu will not be available till an hour later, so we better order both..I told her then I would wait an hour and ordered an appetizer that she said will only arrive in 45 min... After 15 min we had our appetizer and 10 min after that our dinner dishes... This goes to say this was just bluff to get us to order both menus ... As to the food, I find it to be irregularly good, my friend's chicken tagine was good, my couscous's chicken was bad (I was given chicken wings with no meat on, instead of a typical chicken leg or breast). I also would never describe it to be fantastic, when it is in its best I would give it a 7.5/10 I also think the food is pricey for what it is, and specially for the non hospitality of the owner...",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"519,5,"Family owned restaurant serving authentic delicious Moroccon food at a very reasonable price.

Carl Dooley, Top Chef finalist, has been here most of the times I've visited. It's prix fixe and the menu has been very different every time. Good: the dishes are mostly hits, the consistency is there, the price is beyond reasonable. If you want a high end, multi course meal that is impeccably prepared, Dooley has you covered.Average: the service is mostly attentive but not that notable. The wine list is limited and leans obscure. Most of the bottles are pretty well tuned to the cuisine, though. The decor isn't anything special.Bad: one thing I've disliked is the consistent use, or borderline overuse, of cumin in the dishes. I like cumin but it's omnipresent, at least in every visit I've had, and sometimes feels out of place. Â For the price you can't beat this place.

The restaurant is warm and inviting, reservations are easy on OpenTable, and the service was outstanding. We had Christian as our server and he was excellent; explained the dishes well and so personable. The seasonal, ever changing menu was curated to perfection--each dish balanced purposefully, like its own work of art. There were two options for each of the four courses so I recommend coming with someone and ordering one of each, it was fun to try 8 unique items. Well worth the price (and more!) for the intimate, delicious experience!

Nothing special but glad we went there. The Table is a small quiet place with a friendly service. - Oyster with pineapple was a great start. 4/5 I couldn't really taste the oyster since the pineapple was strong.- Cornbread 4.5/5 I really like it but I had a cornbread in the south that were better. - Mussels and Chorizo in a cold broth. 4/5. Â It was a bit too spicy for me but nice a light.-Pork Larb Lettuce Wraps 4.5/5. Very good taste like the authentic Thai Larb.- Lamb shoulder ragout 3.5/5.

Â But with food and wine this good who cares!We chose to order each item between us so we could try all and also do the wine pairing, and so glad we did.

Â So ya, worthy of all the hype and praise.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"525,5,"If I could give this place five or six stars I would. Â Everything about the evening, from the food and the service to the pacing and the ambiance, was sheer perfection. Â The intimate and beautifully decorated space was warm and welcoming, exuding a cozy and homey atmosphere that could not have been further from the cold and pretentious vibe one tends to associate with fine dining experiences.I knew going in that the four-course, prix fixe menu offered two options for each course, but was pleasantly surprised to find that many little extras were included between the courses as well, such as a tray of oysters to kick things off, homemade granola bars to bring home at the end, palate cleansing sorbet before dessert, plus a couple more surprises along the way. Â The attention to detail throughout really impressed me, and we ended up being served more like five or six courses' worth of food before the evening was done.As for the food itself... words almost fail me. Â Between the three of us I was able to sample all eight of the courses in addition to the extras mentioned above, and there was not a single thing that was not spectacular. Â I was especially blown away by the sesame meringue with tahini cream and grape sorbet, and the cured swordfish with pistachios and sultanas. Â And the rabbit leg khao soi. Â Please don't make me choose favorites among these dishes; they are all my children and I love them equally!If dining here I would highly recommend adding the wine pairing option, which for our meal included five expertly selected glasses and truly enhanced the experience every step of the way.We came here to celebrate a special occasion, but I may need to add another line in my monthly budget just so I can return to the Table more often. Â They have a standing wine bar where you can sample some of the food without shelling out for the full dinner service, but honestly I think that would be too much of a tease for me. Â I would definitely want the whole nine yards again.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"526,5,"Where to even start? The interior is very welcoming and cozy. The staff and chef were friendly, engage you conversation, inform you about the details of each dish and very attentive. The food was amazing, the pairing of ingredients was great. We got complimentary oysters from Rhode Island as well as toast with butter. First dish: marinated hiramasa & white kimchi. I really enjoyed the fish and Chef Dooley shared that it actually came from Maine. I liked how the fish was paired with Asian pair which brought a subtle sweetness.Second dish: glazed turnip ravioli & Maine mussels. This was my favorite dish of the night! The chewiness of the mussels with the light crunch of the brussel sprouts and breadcrumbs with the cheesy cream of the ravioli was a perfect combination.Third dish: roasted beef strip loin & short rib ragout. There was a very interesting aroma to this dish (in a good way), it wasn't the beef strip or the short rib. Both were flavorful and good though. Dessert before dessert! We got complimentary apple sorbet :) delicious. Fourth dish: chocolate cremeux. The pumpkin ice cream, mole roasted pumpkin and tortilla streusel bought a combination of textures together(creamy, jelly and crunch).I highly recommend this place, worth every penny.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"527,5,"Wow. Where to even begin for this place. This is the first time where I wish there were more stars on Yelp to give because this restaurant deserves ALL of them. I was a little hesitant about even going to this restaurant at first because of the price (and honestly didn't think any meal would be worth almost $100/person) but after one of the best two hour experiences I've ever had, I'm convinced that it was indeed worth (plus the price includes tax and tip!).Parking: Plenty of street parking all around. You can now pay the meters on an app if you give them your zone and licence plate so no need to bring quarters!Ambiance: This is a really small restaurant so a reservation is a must. We were lucky and able to snag a table on OpenTable like two days before but I think if you want prime dinner time (~7:30), definitely book far in advance. As soon as we walked in, we could tell this place paid attention to detail. The tables were fairly spread out so you didn't feel like you were touching elbows with the couple next to you. The chairs and booth were also very comfortable. The bathroom had soap and lotion (both smelled amazing) and instead of paper towels, had real towels for hand drying. Attire was dressy casual... so like dark jeans/nicer pants but no need to get super dolled up. My boyfriend really liked the old school soul/brass music that was on in the background and apparently the album they were playing came out 9 days ago lol. Guess whoever's in charge of tunes is on top of the game. FOOD: Simply said, it blew us away. Every dish was rich and complex in flavor. Different ingredients hit my palate at different times and I felt like Gordon Ramsay in all his cooking shows. The menu rotates every month so it's super impressive that Chef Dooley and his team can create such detailed masterpieces so often. For March 2018, our favorite course was the first one - the steak was tender, and the fish was fresh. Our least favorite course was the third - I thought the sauce for the rabbit sausage was a little sour, and my boyfriend thought that the monkfish was a little too salty. However, the worst course here was honestly better/at par with a lot of other restaurants we've been to so we can't complain. In between courses we also got a slew of complimentary treats. Oysters to start, fresh sourdough bread in between our first and second course, an amazing blood orange sorbet as a palate cleanser before dessert, and wrapped granola bars to take home. With prix fixe menus, we are always a bit wary at the portion size, but both my boyfriend and I left utterly stuffed. Service: Wonderful. The wait staff were so nice and would explain each dish that was put down. We had a bottle of water on the table, yet never once had to fill our glasses ourselves. My boyfriend left for the bathroom briefly, and a waiter came to fold his napkin so it would be ready for him when he came back. Our waiter also brought us fresh silverware in between every course. The head chef himself brought some of our dishes to us and he seemed so amicable and real. Misc: Every dish (like actual plate/bowl) was super hot when brought out. I don't know why but be careful not to accidentally burn yourself lol. The tables also seemed to be wood (fake? real? idk) but ours had a large bump where we couldn't put anything on. Not a huge deal at all but just something we noticed. Overall, I'd come back here in a heartbeat. I'm already on the lookout for the next iteration of their menu.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"528,5,"We had an incredible dining experience here and still talk about it over a year later.

I was left wanting more of every single course. The decor in the place is quite cool. Haven't seen a $$$$ place set up in this way. The restaurant itself is quite small with about 10 tables maybe. You need to book well in advance to be able to get a reservation. Tables go very quickly. If I remember correctly we reserved ours about 2 months in advance.

Â When we heard about Carl Dooley having a restaurant we had to give it a try.Overall we thought it was really good, but just a couple things kept it from 5 stars. Â  The place is small, cozy, open kitchen, friendly. Â We were greeted with a smile and promptly seated. Â Servers etc all very friendly, perhaps a few seemed new to proper etiquette but overall a decent job.We were given a cold carrot soup that to be honest neither of us cared for at all. Â It was a really bad way to start our meal, as it didn't taste like carrot or have much flavor at all. Â We were worried this was an indication our meal would be the same, thankfully we were wrong.Since it was the prixe fixe menu it worked out well as one of us did not eat meat but seafood was ok and the menu was accommodating. Â The first course was squid or lamb. Â The squid was really, really good, so much flavor in each bite. Â It was a smidge overdressed but still delicious. Â The lamb carpaccio was also really good but was overpowered a bit too much with the olive flavor.We thought it was very odd and to be honest in poor taste to give us somewhat burnt bread. Â The menu listed house-made sourdough bread and who doesn't like homemade bread? Â But when you are toasting bread and sending it out to your patrons why would you send out burnt bread? Â We were trying to think of why you would allow that to leave the kitchen as half the bread was just unedible?The next courses, gnocchi, congee, hake and quail all were really, really good. Â I mean everything had so much flavor. Â We each would have ordered that as an entree just to have more. Â The gnocchi just melted in your mouth, the congee, a lil too much sambal for my spice level but the shrimp sausage, yummy. Â The hake with the morel mushrooms were a perfect match and the hint of sweetest from the peas made it a perfect bite. Â The quail was a lil under and the tikka masala flavor was a little lacking but still all good dishes.Dessert was just as delicious. Â The mint ice cream might have been a tad too strong and a little too much vanilla bean in the custard but we would have eaten 2 more helpings. Â I would definitely recommend this place for someone looking for bold and interesting flavor combinations, you wont be disappointed. Â As always never take my word and check it out yourself.

I had shared with the host on the phone that I had an allergy to raw shellfish. The staffs attention to detail with this information impressed me. As soon as we sat down the server came over to my seat and provided me with a separate menu that had no raw selfish. They must have noted that it was me with the allergy because they didn't even question it when we sat down. Â Every course was delicious!

I personally loved this, but might need a warning for anyone who doesn't like.- The waiter suggested since there were 2 of us to just get everything and share. This was a great idea in theory, but 'redder'/darker spicy options were so hot-spicy that the lighter, usually whiter, fishier option often seemed extremely bland in comparison. My dinner mate also got sick partway through, wondered if something in the spicier dishes didn't agree with him. I felt a stomach roll after the spicy flank steak without knowing why, before watching my dinner mate completely fade and disappear to the bathroom. (Think it may've started for him with the extremely seasoned larb.)Best parts of our night:- Zero knocks to the attending staff: they were incredibly accommodating, attentive, friendly, and helpful even though half our table got sick halfway through the meal, and the other half trying to be friendly about steering clear of major gluten ingredients (without being over the top about it). Volunteered accommodations included corn pasta, a popover, oatmeal crumble for dessert, and packing up the rest of our meal to take home (sans ice cream).- All of the redder options of the meal (flank steak, larb) were hot and delicious, even with the heat+spice. The swordfish(?) entree was also unusually amazing, perfectly textured.- The strawberry rhubarb crumble, fresh granola, fudge, and cherry (sans amaretto) desserts were all quite tasty.Overall, deeply appreciated the staff's friendly professionalism, but not a great-value night for the cost.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"536,4,"Really 4.5 stars.

Everything was balanced and delicious. We were definitely stuffed at the end... ( 4 course with two extra complimentary dessert bites).Instead of commenting about every dish. Our favorite of each course:-Focaccia bread was the best ever. It was extra crunchy on the outside and such soft on the inside. I can hear my bf bit into his bread. It came with a side of burrata with olive, also yum! -Jonah crab & corn lettuce wrap: We liked it because it had a very very strong crab flavor. Basically like a cold crab salad. -Ricotta & corn ravioli was really interesting. The Pancetta was super fatty and moist yet dry on the meat side (as you would expect). -Scallops & pole beans: The scallops were cooked so perfectly. It had a nice butter seat on the outside and super tender inside. You can smell them as you're waiting for your dish. (My bf loved it although he doesn't prefer scallops!)-Complimentary peach sorbet was on point. -Smoked Vanilla Ice Cream Bar surprised me by how strong the smokey flavor was.

We started with a dozen fresh oysters on the half-shell, and they were as good as oysters get. My wife then had the mussels as a main, while I had the pan-seared cod. Both our mains were amazing. Our wine was a very nice and moderately priced Alto Adige MÃ_ller Thurgau.This was a second five-star dinner in as many months at the Foundry. My previous entree was the pork loin, and it too was amazingly scrumptious.We are particularly impressed by the sides, that were as lovingly prepared and presented as the centerpiece of each entree.The service was prompt, attentive, and well-done -- especially for a Saturday night.All in all, a five-star dinner at what is, for us, the best restaurant in Davis Square.",Foundry on Elm,"255 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"541,4,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews!

However, the hostess made my friend feel unwanted immediately due to inappropriate assumptions made about keeping hair out of the buffet, instead of just asking questions. You see, my friend has a visual impairment and has a trained guide dog. According to ADA, service animals are allowed to enter public establishments with their handler, including those with self-service food lines. The hostess told us it was a buffet brunch and said that my friend would have to keep the hair out of the food. She did not welcome us into the restaurant as she starred at the dog. She did not tell us there were other menu items besides the buffet. She did not ask my friend any questions about needs or procedures of a service animal such as: Where does the dog sit during your meal? or If you choose the buffet, will you need assistance getting your plate? Or even simply, I'm not familiar with service animals, will you need any assistance from us while you dine? Although highly unlikely, perhaps the hostess asks every person to keep their hair out of the buffet?I hope you will consider providing education for your employees so that future customers with and without disabilities are treated with respect and made to feel equally welcomed.

It's also easier to get a spot on their extensive bar area for drinks compared to other places when you forget to make a reservation. I've tried a few things here and everything has been generally good. I keep coming back for the burger though. At $15 it's not inexpensive, but it is so good it is definitely worth it.

I pass by frequently, but felt that it was too rich for my blood, and cheaper options nearby were good enough for me. A friend encouraged me to go, and so I decided to live a little. I was not disappointed.Yes, the service was friendly, and helpful. It was all I would expect of a nicer casual dining restaurant, but the food is what blew my mind.The first thing I noticed is that the food is just a normal price for a casual dining restaurant. It is not unusually expensive at all, so that was an initial relief. After cruising the menu she ordered a burger, while I was like, ""YOLO! What's a spaetzel?"" What came back was absolutely delicious.The kitchen reasonably accomodated my nut allergy, and cut that out of the spaetzel. What was left was an absolutely wonderful plate of kale, squash, and green onions. I am not the kind of person to say that vegetables are tasty relative to other vegetables. This plate tasted great in general. It was bar none, hands down tasty. Then my friend could not finish her burger, and I got a piece of that, and was impressed with how soft, and juicy the beef was. Wendys was a good burger to me before, but I have since learned my lesson on how burgers are supposed to be done. Upgrade the french fries to a poutine, and that is a wrap, folks.Do your self a favor, and get to Foundry for dinner one of these days. You will be pleasantly surprised.

Two of us got the beer dinner and the other three ordered off the regular menu. We've been to Foundry in the past for the beer dinner and typically it's two smaller plates accompanied with two beers. Tonight's menu showed two plates with three beers. We thought it was odd, but our server didn't mention anything so we just assumed the menu was correct. After the second course/second beer our waiter came back and asked if anyone else wanted anything to drink. The others ordered another beer and the two of us who ordered the beer dinner were waiting for the last beer, a session IPA. When we asked the waiter about it he looked at us as if we were crazy and said the last two beers listed were a choice, not both. Had we known we would have asked for the session IPA, not the fruity strawberry-blueberry wheat beer or whatever it was. My friend and I were never asked which beer we wanted, and the beer dinner menu didn't explicitly say one OR the other. I've had this particular waiter in the past and he's never been great, but tonight he was unnecessarily rude to the point that I have no interest in coming back to Foundry when there are a handful of other great restaurants around Davis that have great food and friendly waiters.

You can read all about the infamous waits in the other reviews - what I can add is if you do decide to dine here, to only partake in the raw bar OR the crudos.The hot lobster roll here is heavy on the bread and butter - so it's tough to gauge quality, or name it the best that the area has to offer.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"562,4,"Solid restaurant, though not worth the wait/hype... We came around 7pm on a Wed night and there was already a 1.5 hour wait.

That being said, definitely plan to go early to put your name down, as after a certain point in the night they'll stop taking names altogether. We started off with some of the oysters, which were delicious and tasted very fresh. Then I got a lobster roll while my sister got the cioppino. Would have liked to try the pasta I'm a huge fan of lobster rolls, and while I appreciate the generous portion of lobster (which makes up for the $30+ price tag) the roll itself could have been better. There was so much lobster piled on it was difficult to eat and made the bread really soggy. The cioppino was also solid, but not extraordinary.Overall I had a good experience and the service was great.

I only discovered this place because my friends lived in the area and told me I HAD to come here instead of the other well known place (not important enough for me to remember the name apparently). Well, their recommendation did not disappoint.Very cute and quaint place, although I've heard they're always full/packed. My friends and I arrived a little after 2 so the usual lunch storm should have settled, but we still ended up having to wait. No issue, we just put our name down and hopped right into a few of the other shops near by, even popping in for a quick aperol spritzer. The wait was totally worth it! The amount of lobster in our roll was ridiculous. I had to eat some of it with my fork because it was stuffed so full. The traditional version, I've heard is good. But definitely go with the warm buttered version, even though I'm biased and eat the majority of my seafood with butter...you won't regret it!I opted for more carbs and went with fries as my accompaniment, but my friends got the salad, which had a delicious creamy balasamic vinagrette!Definitely come to Neptune Oyster, even though there'll definitely be a wait, it's so worth it!",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"564,5,"This place is amazing, which obviously comes through from the sheer number of reviews and high ratings. Oysters, cioppino, lobster roll... Everything is top notch! I was hesitant to pay for such an expensive lobster roll here since there are so many in Boston, but trust me it's worth it. They give a VERY generous portion of lobster and the hot, buttery roll can't be beat.Pro tip- the wait is always long, so be prepared to put your name down and go explore the city for an hour. I usually eat a light snack and then put my name down so that I'm not hangry by the time I get a seat... They will call you 10-15 min beforehand.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"565,5,"If this were colonial Boston, pilgrims would very likely accuse Neptune Oyster of witchcraft for bewitching the masses with their wickedly good food. Maybe they would claim link to pagan superpowers with Neptune himself? Okay that's taking the metaphor too far, but in any case, Neptune Oyster lives up to the hype. We each started off with a clam chowder, and it's not what I expected--it was better. I'm used to creamy, chunky clam chowder that's heavy on potatoes, and Neptune's version was lighter and with a consistency halfway to that of a soup. It's a surprise after mentally preparing yourself for something indulgent, but you can actually appreciate the subtle flavors of the clams instead of a Campbell's cream of potato. They were also very generous on the portion of fresh whole clams. Similarly, the hot butter lobster roll was no less than epic, even though it was again different from the mayo-based lobster salad rolls I had pictured. Neptune's embraces lobsta rolls in its purest form: an overwhelming serving of pure lobster, minimally dressed with a thin layer of butter, sandwiched in a fluffy brioche bun with just enough carbiness to complement the lobster which stole the show. The fries completed the feast.Tip: The food was delicious and the portions were big. I split with a friend where we each got a clam chowder and shared the lobster roll, and it was the perfect amount of food (with just enough space for a cannoli afterwards). The other seafood looked amazing as well, and I don't think you could go wrong with anything.Tip #2: The space is fall and this place is infamously popular, so I suggest getting here early (i.e. by 5pm on weekdays, and even then expect a wait). They do have a nice system where you can leave your cell phone number and they will alert you when the table is almost ready, so you can wander around the quaint neighborhood and soak in the rustic Italian ambiance while waiting.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"566,4,Came here on Tuesday night at 5pm.

It def taste good. But i have to say its a little bit too greasy and heavyThe server was super friendly and she said they are famous for their butter lobster roll.

We waited to be seated and started off by having the Spanish Octopus, Dayboat Scallops Crudo, Uni Toasts and the Chatham Blue Mussels for appetizers. Followed by the Kumamoto and Beausoleil oysters. The highlights were the charred, tender octopus, the zesty, succulent scallops and the oysters are always good. The Kumamoto was a safe choice and the Beausoleil was recommended by another customer. We would definitely get all of the listed again. The mussels were good and slightly spicy, but nothing extraordinary. The uni toasts didn't really have much of an uni taste as it was overwhelmed by the buttery taste. It tasted like a nice buttery, toasted bread which was yummy but not what we were expecting. Ordered the cioppino and lobster and sea greens salad. The cioppino is always good - it had was delicate but full of seafood flavors in the broth yet feeling so light. It wasn't heavy in tomatoes like other versions. The lobster salad was basically lobster with seaweed, micro greens, nuts and a citrusy dressing. Nice and light if you're looking for something light, but it is mainly lobster and seaweed. So, don't try if you don't like seaweed. Overall, we had a great meal and our friend had the lobster roll, which was nice and yum. The buttery bun was very light and fluffy with a generous mound of lobster. We definitely will come back.

Once your name is on the list, your wait will likely be 1.5+ hours. The wait time when my husband and I visited was a whopping 2.5 hours. I recommend coming here NOT hungry and plan to let the wait build your appetite. Or maybe get a snack at one of the many options in the area. When you are finally seated, expect to get comfortable with your neighbors, as you will probably rub against them as you try to eat. This is especially true if you're seated at the bar.

Some may feel rushed, but you might find you want in and out after having waited 2.5 hours. The oysters are delicious and there are many varieties to choose from. My husband and I also ordered the clam chowder and hot lobster roll. The chowder was phenomenal: creamy, flavorful, abundant in clams, and slightly spicy from black pepper. As with the lobster roll, it was heaping with huge chunks of sweet lobster and the bun was perfectly toasted. It was served with a generous serving of fries that were also delicious.

I certainly walked around the block to build up an appetite. I have to say this cozy restaurant had the most unbelievable lobster roll. It was $31 made with a very meaty melted buttery portion in the most delicious roll they get from Iggy's which is known for their bread. I had a choice of having it with fries or an arugula baby salad. It was a smart move having salad. Prior to that, I had the most delicious selection of oysters from all parts of New England mostly Massachusetts and Maine. they have a really good selection of white wine and all I can say about their Seafood is FRESH! I'm not certain if I would wait that long again but eating here was definitely something that I wanted to do for the past few years!Because this place was popular, sometimes you're seated with people at the regular tables. It was so funny, we've chatted with this young couple who was on a first date... Certainly made dining experience more entertaining. They obviously previewed what we are eating so they ended up ordering the lobster roll, but with fries. I believe they were fresh cut fries but I can't confirm that.

Warm Lobster Roll with butter and a side of dressed greens-- pretty amazing! Also amazing, we stood in line before the restaurant opened on a Saturday and got in for the first seating!! FYI we were about #15 and 16 in line.. we walked past this place in the morning and there were already 2 guys standing by the doors at 10:45 (they open at 11:30). I was trying to count how many seats there were in the actual place, it's about 34 including the bar seating. My husband and I had seats right by the guy shucking and prepping the oyster platters which was fun to see. The Lobster Roll itself was so fresh and stuffed full with a generous amount of lobster meat. For $31 this was like a one time experience. I absolutely loved the roll but not sure I could fully appreciate the nuances that made this the best ever. Given, neither of us eat raw oysters which is the main specialty this place is known for.

At the end of the meal, we checked the bill so we'd learn her name and since it read ""Pickerel"" we assumed some kind of mistake. Nope. Turns out all the waitstaff have ""fish names"" which is the greatest thing I've ever heard. Putting aside the need for an online waitlist tool (and the fact that some pushy people cut in front of us to put their name in), we still had an amazing experience thanks to the stellar service and the crazy delicious things we consumed:Oyster delights:-Wellfleet (from Wellfleet, MA): Medium size, very high salt, sweet butter finish-Savage Blonde (from Bedeque Bay, PEI): Medium size, medium salt, nutty finish, definitely my new nickname-Beausoleil (from Cape Spear, NB): Medium size, medium salt, hints of champagneNot to be missed:-Maine Lobster Roll (obviously we chose the ""served hot, with butter"" option)-Neptune Johnnycake (it's like a dessert, but with fish and caviar, I know it sounds weird but it's amazing-Clam Chowder-FISH NAMES YOU GUYS",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"573,5,"1st Place North End Lobster Roll Throwdown: Pauli's vs Neptune OysterNeptune Oyster is an upscale small diner, dine in only. It is very popular and the line wrapped around the corner just before the 11:30 AM opening. Lobster Roll Throwdown Scoring:Bun: this was a nice grilled medium large brioche style bun 4/5Lobster Taste: this was very fresh, sweet lobster 5/5Lobster Texture: tender with the right amount of chew. 5/5Value: the cold lobster roll with fries was $31. It seems like alot but you get a substantial amount of high quality lobster as well as fries which were also good. You are definitely not going to leave hungry. 3/5Neptune Oyster lives up to the hype. This is one of the top 5 lobster rolls I have ever eaten. It was heavenly. Good lobster rolls are going to cost you and if can afford $31 for a sandwich, this is the one to get on the North Side.

Â My husband and I wanted to go where the locals go. Â The concierge's recommendation... Neptune Oyster Bar. Â It was our first time to Boston and we were blown away by their lobster roll and the spicy Cioppino. Â For four years and 295 days I dreamed about this lobster roll, and finally, I got to return to Boston.I'll give you one guess where we ate our first meal. Â Now, Neptune Oyster Bar isn't a big place, so be prepared to wait. Â Even at our early dinner at 4:30 p.m., we had to wait a few minutes. Â I was with my mother on this trip and she wasn't keen on the Cioppino so she ordered the daily special which was lobster spaghetti. Â It was delicious! Â I'm sure it had a more formal name, but I never looked at a menu. Â I knew what I wanted, a lobster roll. Â  Â Have you ever built something up in your mind? Â Maybe the memory was better than the reality? Â Not so at Neptune Oyster Bar. Â Their lobster roll was just as delicious as I had remembered. Â That buttery roll was STUFFED with lobster. Â My only thought now is that I don't want to wait another 4 years to return!If you're in Boston, make sure you go to Neptune Oyster Bar. Â And if you're not in Boston, it might be worth your while to get there soon!",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"575,4,"*** Disclaimer: I got cold lobster roll with mayo, not hot with butter ***There is no doubt that Neptune Oyster is one of the most popular seafood restaurants in Boston. This seafood restaurant started in 2004 and the restaurant was ranked #79 in ""Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the US for 2016"".I mean holy cow ... the door wasn't even open at 11 AM on Monday and the line had already formed! In fact, the line even went around the block by 11:30 AM! I was the 20th person in the line at 11 AM and was also among the first wave of customers (generally speaking the first wave of customers are the first 30 people in line).Let's get straight to the point - Neptune Oyster's signature item is HOT Maine lobster roll with butter (with an option of fries or salad for side dish). Unfortunately, I should not overhear and listen to the lady who sat right next to me at the bar seats because she influenced my decision and ultimately made me order traditional cold lobster roll with mayo instead. Five minutes later I tried to fix my mistake by asking my waitress whether I could switch my order from cold to hot lobster roll. And the next thing I knew, cold lobster roll came out and she simply said ""oh your order is here already"". The staff was definitely busy handling waves of customers, but I am still in shock that she couldn't even handle my simple request considering how many hot and cold lobster rolls they serve to customers.Oh if you are allergic to seafood, you will only find two non-seafood option on the menu - rib eye steak and burger with fried oysters (okay so burger is not exactly a non-seafood option). Since it is also an oyster house, you will also get a ordering sheet for various oysters from different regions (with detailed descriptions on salt level and flavor profiles). I did notice that saltier oysters were more expensive than oysters with less salt.***Maine Lobster Roll (toasted brioche roll cold with mayo, market price $31): I got the traditional lobster roll and honestly it was a great lobster roll (better than the one at Red's Best Seafood) - just meaty lobster with toasty brioche roll. Salad tasted alright and nothing to write home about.Savage Blond (Bedeque Bay, Prince Edward Island, Canada - $3.30) and Kumamoto (Shelton, Washington - $3.50): Personally I like Savage Blond better than Kumamoto. The flavor profile for Kumamoto described it as low salt, but it still tasted slightly saltier than I expected.***Very solid cold lobster roll (even though I regret not getting hot lobster roll) and overall I would give 4.5-star on their food, but I have to round down to 4-star due to non-attentive bar service, long waiting line, and hefty price.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"576,5,"Everything I dreamed of and more!This was our first stop in Boston, but when we arrived there was a 2 hour wait time. We put our names down and went to Bricco to kill some time. We received a call within 1.5 hours from Neptune. NOTE: You have 10mins to make it back to the restaurant or they will give up your seat!Ordered:x Spanish Octopus - this was probably one of the best octopus I've ever had. It was so tender and juicy. All the ingredients complimented each other so well. My boyfie's sister had octopus for the first time here and really liked it! Do not be scared to try octopus here!!! It's SOOOOO GOOOD!! x Clam Chowder - great clam chowder. Little to no heavy cream so it was lighter than what I'm used to. Generous amounts of clam :)x Hot Lobster Roll - WOW, such good lobster on this roll. I think I may like the lobster at Jame Hook better, but this was SOOO good because it was bathed it butter. I didn't get to try the bread part because I was so full, but the lobster portion was very, very good. Get the hot one, not cold!x Variety of oysters - Tried some medium oysters and small oyster. Obviously, enjoyed the small ones better, but all were super good and fresh. No fishiness at Neptune :)This place is worth the hype IMO. Fresh seafood and a great variety to choose from. If I'm ever back, I will definitely try the ciopinno.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"577,5,"No one gets in the way of my absolute favorite restaurant in all of Boston. Â Nestled in the North End, and usually with a queue out the door, Neptune is still worth the wait. Â Try to get there right when the doors open for the initial seating. Â You must order the warm lobster roll (with hand cut fries or substitute for a salad). Â The warm lobster roll is prepared with, oh - a ton of butter. Â The warm roll is lightly toasted with, oh - a ton of butter. Â It is the most divine lobster roll I have ever had.

The oysters are a bit pricey (at $3-$4 a pop) but I love the variety of oysters they offer! Some other dishes we had included the scallops and the appetizer with the watermelon and fluke! Both were really good! But my favorite was the Black Squid Ink Risotto with Lobster! This was their Friday special and WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!We had originally thought there was only going to be a few pieces of lobster. BUT EVERY SINGLE BITE had a CHUNK full of lobster!!! It was SO good! Highly recommended!(the 2 hour wait was definitely worth it!),Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"580,4,"A delicious find! My friend and I dropped by for dinner on a Sunday night and left happily stuffed! We shared an order of the Momos (half fried and half steamed). They were quite flavorful but a little dry inside. I was expecting some juice to spill out from the first bite, but it was instead dry and a little disatisfying. The Pumpkin Curry was bomb and super super tasty! I'm normally a carnivore, but would happily order this dish again for its spicy kick and creamy base. Pairs amazingly with rice!! We also ordered a Noodle Soup dish with chicken and lots of veggies. It was simple and satisfying. It wasn't amazing, but definitely reminded me of something homecooked with love! Overall, Martsa is a great spot for some tasty, belly-warming, Himalayan feastin'!",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"581,3,"Went to this place with good expectations. We started off by having the Tibetan chai. It's not something we were used to having as the tea Is mixed with salt, milk and butter. We didn't really like it. We then tried the chicken momos. They were really good when had with the chili sauce. We tried the chocho noodles next with the chili pork belly. I felt the noodles were just a little bland and the pork belly was too much on the salty side. Overall it was an average dinner experience for us.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"582,4,"I have to agree with everyone here- food is awesome, service is pretty bad. This was my first Himalayan food experience and it really was delicious. We got the veggie momo, half steamed half fried which really are amazing as others have said. The pumpkin curry was amazingly flavorful, spicy, and sweet and the tofu and bok choy, while definitely on the oily side was great as well (tasted like a fairly typical Chinese stir fry dish, not bad by any means but not as interesting and flavorful as the momo and pumpkin curry).On the other hand, there was one singular server for the entire restaurant. The food didn't take a long time, but getting water refills took forever and it took us about 10 minutes to flag down the waiter to get some extra rice when we asked. He was a perfectly fine nice man, just overworked. I don't know why they can't have more wait staff, the restaurant was full on a Tuesday night and doesn't seem to have an issue getting customers.Overall, food 5 stars, service 2, but rounded up to 4 since the food really was great and imo worth the poor service.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"583,4,"Delicious food! Wonderful and tasty restaurant in davis square. We had chicken momo, cocunut eggplant and lamb delight... everything was delicious. It is also BYOB so we brought some beer. Only negative thing we can say is that we wanted to keep the hot sauce that came with the momo to use with the entrees and the server said we could not keep them because another table needed it. Perhaps have more sets of hot sauce containers? Just a suggestion and some constructive criticism; the food is so good we will definitely be back!",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"584,5,"Great place to dine and enjoy the tasty dishes!

The restaurant closes at 10:30 so I was unsure if the food quality would be not as great but this place did not disappoint! Must haves:-Chicken Marsala curry dish. Seriously excellent complex flavors. I've grown up eating a lot of curries and this is def the best I've tried so far in the area. On the spicy side so beware or get a mango lassi to help cool your tongue! -Beef momos (steamed). Try them with the spicy sauces that come on the side.The chocho (wok fried noodles) with chicken was solid and exactly what we wanted, but not unique compared to the other items. Chicken was very tender.Service: good, friendly, attentive waiter and the food came out really quickly! everything was piping hot and fresh within 10-15 minutes (granted we were one of two tables left at that point)Conclusion? I'm def coming back to try more of their items. Highly recommend this place for curry and momos.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"587,5,They have too many vegetarian and vegan varieties.

I had some of the vegetable momos, which were amazingly flavorful. My main entree was the vegetable nezom, a delicious stir-fried medley of pumpkin, broccoli, eggplant, and zucchini. It was so well-cooked; the veggies were crisp yet cooked through all the way, and the garlic sauce added a nice flavor. Plus, I love pumpkin anything and everything, so the savory pumpkin chunks were a nice touch of uniqueness to the dish. The portion was huge but I cleaned the plate. My only suggestion would be to make the dish a tad less oily. The staff are super friendly and aptly dealt with our extremely large group. The restaurant is small but cozy and homey. I look forward to coming back here when I'm near Davis!",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"592,3,"This is a yummy and affordable option in an otherwise somewhat pricey area. I was unsure what exactly Nepalese cuisine entailed, but to a non-culinary expert, it was basically a blend of your favorite Chinese and Indian dishes (I apologize for oversimplifying what I'm sure is a distinct culinary culture, but if you've also never had Nepalese food, hopefully that description helps).The food was good but not the best I've ever had. We started with vegetarian momos (basically another word for dumplings) which were yummy but didn't blow other dumplings I've had away. I had the Gyathuk Chocho with chicken for my meal and enjoyed it, but again, no more than other pan fried noodles I've had. To be fair, I lived in Dongguan for a couple months and regularly ate noodles like this from street vendors so I'm perhaps a bit biased. They have a lot of vegetarian options which might compel me to come back when I'm looking for somewhere to do dinner with my non-carnivorous friends. Big bummer for me is that they don't have a liquor license. Understandably, I should have done my research to discover that beforehand, but that's always gonna cost you a star in my book. Who knows though, as Boston starts to allow BYO that could become a huge plus for this place.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"593,4,"I'm a picky eater and this was my first time trying Tibetan food, but I loved it and have come back a few times since.

It's a Tibetan/Nepalese/Himalayan restaurant, which I'm sure most people haven't tried (I have not before last week either). I think I would describe it as a mix between what an average Americans know as Chinese food and Indian food. The server was very friendly and helpful. He gave his insight on the dishes that we were ordering and also warned us about their spicy sauce (It actually wasn't that spicy to my palate). The food is what really amazed me though. We ordered Momos (they look very similar to Chinese buns/dumplings), Aloo Tikka (potato cakes topped with mint), and Shamday (Tibetan beef curry). Momos were delicious and it came with two different sauces (one mild and one spicy). Aloo Tikka was surprising, since I was expecting a hot dish, but it was served at ambient temperature (I think that's normal?). Regardless of the surprising temperature, dish was delicious and the mint sauce was to die for. Lastly, the curry was good, but I felt that the portion was a little bit on the smaller side. If you're up for trying out a new cuisine, I would recommend visiting Martsa On Elm.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"595,3,"I enjoyed the variety of food options ranging from Tibetan, Indian, Pakistini, and much more. They offer various options of meat, chicken, beef, lamb, and vegetarian, so there is something for everything.I came here on a Saturday night with my friend. It was pretty full, and there isn't a lot of space, so expect to be cozy with your neighbors. The food came out in a timely fashion, and I highly recommend trying out the momos! We ordered the chicken momos, which come in a group of 8. Because we couldn't decide on having steamed or fried, they actually offered the option to get half friend and half Â steamed. Highly recommend that option! Best of both worlds!It has a nice ambiance, cozy atmosphere, and a great place for an intimate date. Because they were very busy, it took a while for my friend and I to get water refills and our bill at the end of the night. If you're looking for a nice, sit-down dinner and have the time to spare, I highly recommend this place.

The food was fantastic - so many vegetarian options and everything was fresh and expertly spiced. We tried three appetizers and three entrees among 4 people and it was the perfect amount and variety.As some other reviewers have referenced, there was a disgruntled customer in the restaurant tonight. It seems he ordered a special dish that takes awhile to come out, and when other diners in the restaurant we're receiving food before him, he stood up, made an absolute scene, and stormed out, leaving a woman he was with behind at the table. She quietly waited for him to stomp down the block before talking quietly with the staff, who had just tried to follow him out to talk to him as he made his dramatic exit. It's a small, family friendly restaurant. You can expect great food to come out hot and fresh and as quickly as they can make it.

Oh, and the fish was way overcooked.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"598,5,"This is a Nepalese place so its worth is measured by its momos. Â The other dishes are irrelevant to me. Â They're like little asteroids circling Planet Momo.Let's cut to the chase: Martsa makes the best steamed dumplings I've had in Boston. Â I've had 'em all, beef, veggie, chicken, even pork. Â They all achieve the trifecta of the perfect dumpling: 1. Soft but slightly chewy dough that doesn't fall apart2. 70%-30% filling to dough ratio3. Delicious filling.I've had a lot of dumplings in the area and it's usually the finer details that separate the memorable from the forgettable. Â What makes Martsa's momos superior to the other places are the flavors in the filling and the chili dipping sauce.A successful filling has strong flavors that are subdued enough not to jump out and kick your taste buds in the face but prevalent enough that you taste the warmth and flavor. Â I like my filling to fall closer to the unsubdued end of the spectrum. Â I want the meat to be subtle but enhanced by a slight crunch of veggies and the powerful backdrop of garlic and ginger. Â Martsa delivers on every count.The momos don't need a dipping sauce but the red chili sauce that comes with it takes the entire experience to the next level. Â Most importantly, it's hot. Â If the filling isn't powerful enough for you, the sauce will make sure you have tears of both pain and joy running down your cheeks. Â In addition to being hot, it's also delicious. Â The chef manages to coax out the maximum flavor from the chilies he uses and it ties the entire experience together.I've often paired this with a mug of steaming hot Indian chai, Southeast Asia's answer to the latte. Â It's a creamy, sweet tea with just a little bit of froth that complements each bite of a steamed momo dipped in fiery red chili sauce. Â It's also great afterwards to help the food down and doubles as a dessert.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"599,1,"While the noodle soup is out of this world, we had TERRIBLE service, which was profoundly disappointing. After 4 of 5 were served in a relatively timely manner, a 6th arrived and got his food in a jiffy. The 5th person waited an hour before getting his food. All of us were already done eating! When the bill came, they overcharged us for something we did not order, and when we asked about the meal's lateness, both the server and the owner came over to our table and yelled in our faces. It was so upsetting, especially because their food is generally good. We were shocked and will not be coming back. We had hoped to be respected, as most customers are, but that was not the case.
