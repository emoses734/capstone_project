Followed by mains of: lobster, snapper, sea bass.Sides make the meaThe sides of creamed spinach, Brussel sprouts, roasted corn, and broccoli. All incredible!! Â Service was fantastic!!Back again for the second time. This time I had the scallops and clam chowder. Incredible. Scallops were perfectly prepared on a bed of risotto. Clam chowder was superb.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,"Atmosphere: sophisticated, high energy, but also had a laid-back, almost retro kind of elegance. Most patrons were impeccably dressed for upscale/night on the town, although I did see a few in ripped jeans and tank tops, who should have been turned away. It's not a trashy nightclub, folks.I had the beat manhattan, the best crab, and the best creme brÃ»lÃ©e ever here.Service: Impeccable. Our server was patient, delightful and genuinely cared for our entire experience. My husband, 12 year old son and I were in a smaller dining room with an incredibly loud, unruly group of people who were drunk and swearing. We couldn't even hear each other speak. The waitress noticed our discomfort (especially our son, who has issues with overwhelming noise) and the dining room manager found another place for us to enjoy our meal. A cozy booth in the main dining area. Our biggest worry was that we'd have another server perhaps not as wonderful as Sabrina, but she let us know she'd be taking care of us. The dining room manager came by to make sure everything was okay.Now the food: Fantastic. We enjoyed the truffle deviled eggs with caviar, and the ""smoking"" shrimp cocktail. My son had a beautiful 6 oz filet mignon and king crab legs. Husband had the sea bass, and I enjoyed an off-menu salmon with a crab saladOn top. For sides we chose the lobster mashed potatoes and spinach. Both were very good. I got to try a little of everything! We barely had room for dessert but couldn't resist. Baked Alaska, carrot cake, and creme brÃ»lÃ©e were outstanding. We hardly finished half, because Sabrina brought us butter cake to try as well. Divine!I can't say enough good things about Ocean Prime. We weren't there for any special occasion, just in town for a memorial service and wanted a great meal. They made us feel special and cared for, in addition to serving up amazing food and drink. You can't really ask for more than that. Bill was $347 and worth every penny.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,"Happy birthday to meeeeeeeee!!!This year was super low key as I had a lovely dinner with my mom (last year I was in Europe).Everything was amazing! The food (piping hot, fresh and cooked to perfection), service, live music and ambiance.The hostesses are all so sweet and friendly. It was very lovely interacting with them all upon entry. They definitely set the tone. Thanks ladies!Our server was Alain C. He is kind, knowledgeable of all menus (cocktail and food) and had a great personality. He also made great recommendations - you must try the blackened snapper! I'm so glad Ocean Prime has been established in Boston (I'm in San Fran and the closest one to me is in Beverly Hills)...Overall it was a wonderful birthday and I am so happy that I celebrated at Ocean Prime!",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,"Our first time in Boston and wanted a nice dining experience. Ocean Prime did not disappoint. Everything from the service to the food was amazing. We had the Calamari which was so tender and delicious. Cream of Lobster soup, and a seafood dish. We took to go the chocolate, peanut butter desert. I would definitely dine here again!",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,"I won't tell you about the food, experience that all on your own.The SERVICE here is off the wall phenomenal.Ask for Derek Shaw and hope that Julie Beal is managing the night you're there! It's worth the price of admission and you'll want to come back for more!!!",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"3,"I went to Ocean Prime with a group of friends. Â I am not normally a ""steakhouse"" guy, in part because I find them overly expensive. Â I don't need a 24 oz steak tonight, thank you. Given the extensive seafood options on the menu, I had high hopes.The decor is sort of Las Vegas meets steakhouse -- perfectly nice, but nothing particularly exciting. Â The service was extremely attentive -- perhaps overly so -- but our waiter was extremely well-informed, had strong wine suggestions. Â The food was fine. Â Everyone was pleased with their dish, but frankly, I was somewhat underwhelmed with mine for the price. Â The spicy tuna sushi roll was decent, but I get better sushi at my local sushi place next to a gas station, and they don't charge $18 for a single roll (and theirs have more actual tuna). Â My scallops were nicely done, but the risotto that accompanied it was a bit of a cheesy mess. Â My companions were all pleased with their meals, so take my criticisms with a grain of salt.Bottom line: Â it is a perfectly fine restaurant that charges you an arm and a leg for food that was underwhelming and is done better at other restaurants. Â I left feeling full, but for what the meal cost, I wasn't satisfied.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,"Best place in Boston! Big variety of all kinds and it's all 5 Star. Sushi apps, seafood and steak and all the sides like jalapeÃ±o potatoes, truffle Mac & Cheese and chopped corn house. The drinks are all great. The service is great. Levi was an outstanding waiter. I tried the surf & turf tonight. Amazing. My wife had the filet and lobster tail. You can't go wrong here.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,Visited this location while in town for work. Overall this area is really building up and is growing into a very cute social area. We ate outside as the weather was perfect. We were the only table outside but felt we had good service and weren't forgotten. All of our dishes were a good size (larger than expected) and arrived quickly. Would definitely go again!,Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"4,"Late dinner here with work friends, they were full up for reservations when I checked online. It was no better when I called so we figured we'd just wait it out when we arrived. It worked out well. There was an open table in the bar area and we just stayed there for our starters and dinner.Calimari to start was excellent. Crispy, not heavily battered and very tasty. Great dish to share. The deviled eggs were great but I'm not sure why three eggs were $13. Tasty and tangy with mustard, topped with caviar? You couldn't taste the caviar at all.For main, I chose the Chilean sea bass. A nice cut, very well plated. Delicious, cooked properly. Nice and flaky.For dessert, we got one order of the ten layer carrot cake. It was good. Excellent presentation and quite fancy. The icing was light and not too sweet.Tip: Get the jalapeno potatoes au gratin. Yum!",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"1,"I'm honestly disappointed in ocean prime. Based on priced I would expect the food here to blow me out of the water. The food, in general is mediocre, and didn't taste very fresh. It is a chain so I'm not sure why I expected local lobster/seafood.. we are only in Boston seaport. We ordered the double lobster tail meal was almost 50 and for the price I was honestly surprised at how little meat came in here. Personally, I had the Caesar salad and added scallops. Please let me tell you that this salad is 12 dollars. Okay. It's a salad. Reasonable. When I asked for scallops it came with 4... and the total price was 40 dollars!! FORTY! For a salad with 4 scallops. Honestly WOW and the scallops weren't fresh and tasted fishy. I was so disappointed and actually had a mouth drop. Someone explain this to me. The one thing that saved it here was the carrot cake. Worth it. It's delicious.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"4,"Solid choice for a fancy night out. It's a bit expensive, but that's expected in seaport. Can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was good but had too much of a mustard flavor for my liking. Â If you are getting soup, I recommend the French onion. It is amazing.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"4,"My boss took me here after a recommendation from a colleague and had a great night. We had the oysters and shrimp cocktail to start and honestly I found the best oysters I had eaten so far in the US. Very fresh, large, and perfect aftertaste.My 2 colleagues had the steak which they rated better than Mooo that we went to the night before. One had the dry aged from Kansas and he said his was top notch. I had the sea bass which was kinda average. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it was nice without blowing anyone away. Great wine pairing from sommelier- and a couple of strong but great old fashioned's to start. Service was quick considering it was rammed. Would recommend highly.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,"Made reservations on open table, wasn't crowded at all and got seated immediately. I ordered the lobster bisque soup and teriyaki salmon over rice.. Really good, hot and a lot of flavor. The server was really good, fast and attentive. Great spot to good a good dinner after along day.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,"A gem in the seaport! I have been to Ocean Prime numerous times since they opened in the Seaport - they are my go to place! I love their lunch special, my favorite being the salmon teriyaki. For dinner I love their steaks. Great bread basket. Service is stellar. But the desert... oh my. They make the BEST baked Alaska I have ever had! The carrot cake is also a good second choice.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"4,"Have been to Ocean Prime before, just not this location. Same name, same great experience. The surf and turf app is excellent, potatoes could have used some more seasoning, but scallop and short ribs were awesome. Since it was lunch, I took advantage of their lunch 6oz filet with two sides for $35. The lobster bisque was creamy and a little spicy which I enjoyed. Great meal without breaking the bank (for lunch anyway).",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"4,"This restaurant lays in the hot area of Boston seaport. This was my first time hearing of and visiting Ocean Prime, and it's hard to believe this is a chain restaurant, as my experience was fantastic and attention from its staff was perfect. We came here to enjoy my birthday celebration, and with a reservation ahead, we were sat immediately into a large spacious booth. Other parties around us were definitely loud but I enjoyed it as Â festive and prefer this type of atmosphere when dining out. We first ordered a couple cocktails that tasted excellent. Then we ordered the surf & turf appetizer, made of 2 fresh scallops, pulled pork, and mashed potatoes set in a dark flavorful sauce. I also had the twin lobster, both cooked fresh and just at the right texture and flavor. The asparagus that came with it was cooked just right. The fiancÃ© ordered the 16oz boneless ribeye on medium rare heat. It was at a perfect pinkish-red all around. Truffle butter was extra but the combination with the steak was just perfect. We also ordered a clam chowder which was well seasoned and the blend of bacon, potatoes, and clams were enjoyable. We also received a complimentary dessert as part of my birthday, for which I ordered the blueberry cheesecake. We did enjoy it, but could not finish it because of how full we were. Great atmosphere and food overall, and I'd love to come here again for another special occasion.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"3,"We rarely venture out to the Seaport because you know, Boston traffic. But the in-laws picked Ocean Prime for dinner, so there we went. The restaurant itself is quite large, lots of booth seating, very similar to the likes of Capital Grille, Flemings etc. Guess they're all frankly in the same category of upscale chain restaurants. The food is decent but not outstanding in any way. I have had the exact same dish served here in many other restaurants in the past, as the menu is quite standard with very little novelty. The raw oysters were small and did not taste nearly as good as other oysters places in town. The shrimp cocktail was huge and came out in a showy bowl of liquid nitrogen, but was a bit overcooked for me. My miso sea bass was thick and flaky but the flavors did not impress. A very similar version I had a couple weeks later down in Florida blows this one out of the water. The butter cake was too dense and not nearly as good as Mastro's.Our waiter was the most strange part of the meal. I can't exactly call him inattentive because he was there and did everything that needed to be done. However I would never call the service we received friendly, and it was even quite awkward at times. I don't know if that's just his personality or he hated us for some reason but was still trying to be civil...Anyways, at this price caliber, I would definitely go to Island Creek for seafood or Capital Grille for steak over Ocean Prime for better quality of food. If you just need some place nice to take out some clients etc in the area, this would do.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,"Let's start with the drinks ! Berries & bubbles was incredible, it's not to strong but after a while the alcohol starts to kick in. It was a great combination with the surf and turf (shrimp and steak.) The steak was cooked just how I wanted, along with the shrimp. Everything was very filling, however I didn't get to enjoy more of the Mac and cheese because I was so full but it was delicious very thick and creamy. Food and drink was just a 10 out 10 forgot the 5 stars. The pricing is a little up there but that should be expected. The waiter was extremely patient and helpful. The restaurant it self had live music, they were awesome and even though it was a busy Friday night, everything seem just right. Make sure you look formal. There's a lot of businesses around so that's where most of them have lunch/dinner with there suits and dresses. Also, do yourself a favor take an Uber or Lyft, there is parking but driving there will not be necessary.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,Between my sister and I we have been quite fortunate to have experienced many of the high end steak Resteraunt's in Boston. Last night for my sisters birthday I treated four or is to OCEAN PRIME. Â The lobster bisque was fantastic. The crab cake was average. We had two filet mignon one 6 oz the other 10. My partner in crime got the Kansas City Strip- OMG Â so flavorful! The 4th member got Teriiyaki Salmon- very good. Let it be known that all steak eaters believed the best steak out of all high end steak houses. I must not forget we had the most wonderful waitress originally from Â Galway. Such a professional and a great quick sense of humor. The price for such a perfect meal is NOT for the faint of heart.,Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"3,"Widely popular, and often very crowded and noisy, Ocean primes serves deliciously (expensive) appetizers and entrees of both land and sea creatures. My service/hospitality was poor, which is why I rated it as such.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"4,"The Beehive is my Boston go-to for live jazz, a couple of really good after dinner drinks and great people watching. Â Honestly, it's one of my favorite places in Boston to do this.In the winter, it's cozy, warm, and the perfect place to forget about the snow and just kick back. During the summer, their outdoor seating area (on a brick patio in front of the BCA Cyclorama) is incredible and you get to see why the South End is such a cool neighborhood.It's not necessarily my #1 dinner spot if I'm in the South End, but I love this place. Â If you're looking for a great date place or visiting from out of town, you need to go here. Â Because it's not a stereotypical Boston spot (Irish, historic, or the North End), it won't show up in guide books, but it's a must hit if you're in town!",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"After reaching out to numerous friends for my recent weekend trip to Boston several of them told me The Beehive was a must for brunch. If you're a fan of live music, an upbeat atmosphere, and someone who appreciates a new spin on brunch from time to time I'd definitely check this place out.My friends told me it be best to make a reservation since it gets super busy during standard brunching hours and boy were they right. When my friend and I walked in there had to have been about 12 people waiting to request a table with the hostess. I let her know that we had a reservation and we were instantly led to our table. The space itself is massive, with two floors they were probably serving well over a hundred people during the time we were there. They placed us at a table on the main level close to the stage which was really appreciated. When I had made the reservation I let them know we were celebrating a special occasion (catching up with an old friend). I'm happy they accommodated us for it!When it came time to order I wanted to stick with a something unique to the restaurant. I choose it's namesake Beehive X Burger ($19) which came with some unique toppings such as chipotle avocado slaw and bacon jam, along with a side of fries. This was definitely an extremely well made and tasty burger! I was particularly hungry that morning and this hit the spot. This burger also didn't fall apart in my hands after the first bite which is something to be appreciated.Our servers were really great too. They gave us time to look over the menu and made sure to ask us if everything was alright with our dishes half way through our meals. This place claims to be the best brunch in Boston and even though I haven't been everywhere it definitely takes the cake in my book in terms of putting a lively spin on the classic brunch experience.",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"3,"The ambiance at The Beehive was amazing - easily 5 stars. This might be my new go-to place for a drink and some live music. It felt very NOLA: jazzy and cool.The service was also good. Our server was so nice, I wish she had stopped by more (mainly for drink refills) but she answered all of our questions and put our order in at lightning speed (literally we ordered and got drinks and food within 15 minutes - crazy!)The only real disappointment was the food. We went for brunch and the menu was fairly limited, but there were still a lot of good-sounding options. I chose the egg shakshuka, which I've never had (let alone heard of) before and wasn't sure what to expect. It was kind of a salsa/polenta dish with poached eggs. Not bad by any means, but not something I'd order again. Unfortunately they ran out of the sausage that goes with it so we got bacon instead and that ended up being a not so great combo.Overall, I will definitely come back to The Beehive for a drink and to just hang out for a while. Their bar scene is far above anywhere I've been in Boston so far, but I may just stick to snacks next time.",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"4,"This place is perfect if you're looking to elevate your brunch experience with live jazz music and classy vibes. Â I LOVE the look and feel of this place with its exposed brick walls, charming dÃ©cor and beautiful chandeliers. The live jazz music really adds to the energy and positive vibes during brunch. Â We had the eggs shaksuka, short rib benedict w/fries, salmon cakes with poached eggs & salad, and the poutine with short ribs & poached eggs, along with Bee-linis and iced coffee. The most memorable part was the short rib on the benedict and poutine- super tender and savory! All the food was yummy, though nothing out of the ordinary given the steep prices. The live jazz music experience and the hearty servings do make the price tags forgivable, but this is certainly a place you go to when you want to indulge once in a while. Overall, my friends and I had a great time so I will definitely be back--maybe to give dinner a try!",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"4,"My Boston coworkers recommended this and so we went.It was a little loud, but the stage with live music is appealing, and we were disappointed that we ultimately couldn't sit downstairs (the only table was in the line of the drafty door that was opening and closing often) --- after we settled in, it was actually pretty cool.Everything we ordered was yum, so you'll get a good meal.*My most favorite were the ribs.* Â Service isn't particularly quick, so go here with folks you want to socialize with and you will have a grand time!",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"4,"The Beehive was the honeycomb to my birthday evening, many thanks to Steven the Host & Michael, the so fun & so fantastic Bartender.8P came around & I headed downstairs to the dim lighted, cozy dining area staged with white linen tablecloths & mahogany furniture, setting off a classy yet funkdafied atmosphere. Its the same menu both in the bar & dining area offering Chicken, Seafood, Steak, Lamb & even Duck.I could only consume Frites & a Salad, yet the wine tastings & multiple birthday glasses of Â wine worked perfectly for me. Ode to wine on the bottom of the Wine Menu a quote reads ""There must always be wine and fellowship, or we are truly lost"" - Ann Fairbairn. Our table was front & center of the stage that enhanced watching the band, Ladies & Gents...The Brad Goff Band! The Violinist was superb as the rhapsody of all the musicians provided a delightful jam session. There is live music every day of the week, check the website for detailed information.Beehive is located in the Arts complex of Boston's South End offering a artistic backdrop of positive vibes, a mixture of cuisine, a vibrant bar scene & wicked musicians. Beehive also offers a Sunday Brunch.

Our waitress was friendly and swift. But I was surprised to have such a mediocre brunch. The shakshuka was a bit runny for me and the Moroccan sausage was dry. We also got the $19 burger (really?) that tasted okay. I've had more flavorful burgers at Five Guys. We did enjoy their potato chip fries. Their drinks are creative - we each got the Viva Tokyo and it had a nice kick. I didâ€‹n't quite get the hype but I'll have to give them another chance with dinner.,The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"My girlfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner, ordered scallops over pea mash and the steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. We absolutely loved it! Cocktails were killer (Bigwig was my fav), staff was friendly, food was DELICIOUS, and the atmosphere was unparalleled. Make sure you set a reservation because this place is poppin' on the weekends. Downstairs bar and dining area is a prime spot for viewing the live jazz bands that play there Friday/Saturday nights. Definitely coming back soon!",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"The Boy had family coming to town to visit so we had thought why not take them to a restaurant that offers live music entertainment. The Beehive delivered a superb meal while offering a cool, fun ambiance.To stat we got the Bread N' Butter - warm sourdough served with delightfully addictive sea salt and honey butter. Never have I seen a basket of bread disappear sooner. We also got the Devil Eggs which in addition to being topped with bacon also came with a refreshing carrot slaw. Finally we got the Fall-Off-the-Bone Baby Back Pork Ribs. These were finger-lickin' good! They were sweet and sticky and so damn tender. Highly recommend.For my main dish, I got the Cauliflower-Brussel Sprouts Curry. I saw this being ordered by so many tables around me and after those ribs, I thought I could do without a protein-heavy entree. Did I mention that The Beehive offers a bunch of vegetarian-friendly dishes? Not only are there plenty of offerings, but this curry was BOMB. So much flavor and I loved dipping garlic naan in there or using the naan to grab at the cauliflower and brussels. The Boy and his dad shared a short rib grilled cheese and a burger - each eating half.Despite being full, dessert was obviously ordered anyway. We got a bread pudding and a cheesecake. Cheesecake was very dense (possibly because it's gluten-free) but the bread pudding was on point. The whipped cream was light and fluffy and paired well. The bread pudding wasn't too dense or oversaturated with syrup.Overall, divine meal from The Beehive. Looking forward to trying their highly talked about brunch in the future!",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"I've been wanting to come here for brunch for a while now.

I'll definitely be back to try dinner and a cocktail!,The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"3,"3/5 starsHmm, it is strange to me that they would charge us $$ for being late to our reservation like 15 minutes late. We arrived 5 minutes late, which was fine, but we didn't get seated until 20 minutes later...so if they are going to charge us money for being late, i feel like they should pay us money if they are late.Regardless of that reservation policy, the food was good. The service was good. I would've probably given it 3.5-4 stars if it weren't for that reservation policy.Ambiance is OK--pretty loud place. Ordered:1) MIXED SPRING VEGETABLE CURRY, VADOUVAN SPICE, PANEER, GARLIC NAAN - 3.5/5 pretty good. Not very authentic curry, but pretty good vegetarian option.2) DUCK AU POIVRE, MUSTARD JUS, PICKLES, SCHMALTZ FRIED RICE: 4/5 Great dish if you love duck.

First, they couldn't seat me until my guest arrived. I get that when it's busy, but at least the upper level was empty. So they invited my to wait at the bar. Ok, but when I was ready to be seated the bartender thought it would be easier to close out my bill with him first. Easier for whom? And $5 for tea!!!On the other hand, it was really good tea, a nice big pot of hot loose black tea. Very nice. And once seated the service was excellent and the food was interesting and delicious. I had the Eggs Shakshuka with Moroccan sausage. Great flavours and a nice size serving. My 200lb athletic son had the Short Ribs eggs benedict which looked challenging even for him.And did I mention the live music? Pretty cool for brunch.

On weekends they have live jazz playing during brunch. For brunch, I recommend getting the eggs benedict with short ribs, you will leave filling very full. The quiche is a good option if you want something light. My dining partner got the Bloody Mary (as a lot other ppl were doing and he liked it) and I just got coffee which was fine. Service is excellent, our waitress came over several times to see if we wanted anything else or drink refreshments.

This did the trick! We had a great table on the main level and were by the overlooking balcony so we could see and hear the live music. My fellow helper went with a specialty African brunch dish. It was tasty, but a tad too adventurous after over-Imbibing. I swayed snd couldn't decide. Short rib Benedict it was. A nice mix of the hearty, and more special than standard breakfast fare.

Â We got the special appetizer which the waitress raved about- which was just pieces of bread with some odds and ends. Â Totally not worth the money. Â Then the main entrees came out, 2 looked okay, I honestly didn't ask if they were good because I was focused on mine being a joke. Â For $24 I got noodles floating around in some kind of liquid by the name of noodle paella.

Â I couldn't eat it with a form because the noodles wouldn't stay and all I would get is onion. Â I ate maybe 4 bites. Â The lamb neck got a similar reception. Â It was what looked like an enormous hunk of meat and nothing else on a plate. Â Then turned out to be all bone and impossible to find meat. Â The decision was made never to order lamb neck again. Â I wish the waitress would have asked how I liked my meal after she picked up my entirely untouched plate but she didn't.

Â  The crowd is more casual, the food is better, and the bottomless mimosa's....yes please. Â If you are looking for a hangover cure, I must recommend the short rib poutine. Â  The fries soak up the gravy and the rich flavor of the short ribs make this a savory delight. Â  The chicken fried steak with the biscuits and gravy were also a hit with our struggling crew. Â  Word to the wise...this will not be cheap. Â  Think more like dinner prices than breakfast prices. Â  Â But I've never been disappointed so to me, it's worth it.",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"Very nice restaurant. Staff is friendly, professional and fast. Food is delicious I tried fish soup, some Maine oysters and grilled octopus as appetites along with both Monkfish and the sea-bass for main dishes. All was heavenly delicious! Thanks for your service and your delicious food! Number one restaurant in Boston.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"4,"M brought me to Ostra to celebrate my birthday before a show at the Opera House. We had a reservation for 5:30, when they begin seating for dinner. M arrived a bit early though so he waited at the bar, for me, but also for them to start seating so don't come early if you're the first reservations of the night.The space is huge and airy with opera ceilings, a lot of white, and giant ocean-themed canvas prints. To be honest, it felt a bit sterile and cold, but hey, we're here for the food.They have an enormous wine list, with a wide range of price points. We selected a nice dry bottle of rose that we really liked. They also bring you bread for the table that I really liked, a nice onion loaf, super soft and warm.We started with the lobster gnochetti with truffle that I loved. Super creamy and rich, with nice sized chunks of lobster and a lot of truffle flavor. For entrees, M had the halibut and I had the monkfish, both were delicious. Our one reservation with the food: it is very, VERY rich, almost too much so (actually too much so for M, on the border for me). Don't get me wrong, butter is delicious, but the flavor of it overwhelmed some of the other flavors for us. Ostra is very expensive for the portion sizes but it's a delicious indulgence that I'd be happy to repeat. That said, I go out for exorbitant dinners rarely enough that it will probably be a while before I'm back at Ostra.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"Let's see: we split Sea Bass Tartare, Jamon Plate, octopus, King crab tortellini. Then he had Sea Bream and I had Salmon. Absolutely delightful meal and not the least bit heavy. I am leaving full and satiated but not rolling out over stuffed. Courses were timed perfectly. Service was impeccable. May very well be my new favorite. If you have not yet been to Ostra, you are missing out. The food is beautiful, creative, delicious and light. This chef knows seafood. Our second trip to Ostra, we shared the salt crusted branzino. The preparation and presentation of this whole fish is wonderful. The lemon sauce pour over is the perfect touch. Even after sharing starters of sea bass tartare, a raw fish special, charred octopus and king crab risotto, the branzino AND dessert, we left completely satisfied. Full but not rolling out for a nap. The service (Calvin!) was impeccable, professional yet fun and he picked a great wine for me, picky as I am! The manager recently transferred from L'Andana, brings his attention to detail, and above average knack for hospitality to Ostra. We would visit every week if we lived closer!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"If you love seafood, this is the place to be! Seafood on the wall, with your drinks and on your plate. The attention to food and ambiance is impressive. Michelin needs to come and give this place Boston's first star!We arrived a bit too early for our 530p resy. They were still setting up for service but happily sat us at the bar. I started with the oyster martini which was a delicious light version of an oyster shooter. Dinner was flawless from start to finish. Staff were attentive but not overbearing. The warm house bread with it's doughy center was a perfect vehicle for the sweet butter and olive oil with just a touch of sea salt. I'm in New England, so of course I had a half dozen oysters to start. Followed by the crab risotto and Rhode Island calamari. The Jonah crab spuma was delicious topped with chunks of king crab. This risotto was not too rich at all. The calamari was the best I've tasted--crispy tentacles and perfect rings to dip in the lemon garlic aioli and bouillabaisse brodo. Â The monkfish with mushrooms was light, meaty and savory. To end was a delicious blueberry ice cream to commemorate our celebration. We enjoyed the meal without feeling rushed and just in time to catch our show at the Boston Opera. Definitely a winner!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"We had an amazing dinner at Ostra. It was a bit pricey, but worth it. I had the 8 oz filet and shared the grilled corn and parmesan truffle fries with my boyfriend. Everything was delicious. For mainly being a seafood restaurant, they cooked the steak perfectly. He had oysters and the breme. He loved both. He wanted to order a second breme. That's how much he liked it. The bread was warm and delicious. The desserts were great as well. He had the hazelnut mousse and I had the berries and rose. The service was impeccable. It was very quick and attentive. Our waiter and busboy did a fantastic job. They got a little busier as the night went on, so the service wasn't as attentive as when we first got there, but that was to be expected since a large party was seated in our section. The servers and chefs paid attention to details, which made a huge difference. For example, the plates were hot, we received warm towels between our first and second courses, the table was cleaned of crumbs before dessert, and the salt and pepper shakers were taken after dinner. I also appreciated how the, who I assumed was the manager but may have been an owner, helped the staff. I saw him setting tables, talking with guests, and serving some dishes. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"4,"My boyfriend surprised me by taking me here on my birthday and it ended up being quite a memorable experience. The interior of the restaurant is so beautiful with a minimalistic aesthetic all throughout down to even the plates and silverware. For our appetizer, we decided on the grilled Spanish octopus which is something I'd recommend as it was simply delicious. My boyfriend ended up ordering the paella for his entree which he was pretty satisfied with and I had the skate wing special of the night. The skate wing was cooked to perfection as it was crisp on the outside but incredibly soft on the inside. To finish off the night, we had the beignets which were actually more like donut holes to me but nevertheless very good.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"Legitimately some of the best food I've had in a long time. My family held a private event here before the marathon, so we had the ability to try a number of passed hors d'oeuvres before ultimately ordering our entrees. The one big standout was the crispy maitake mushroom. I believe it was fried in tempura, could be wrong, but it was cooked so perfectly. Easily the best mushroom I have ever eaten. Amazing how something could taste so crispy yet silky, and airy, but so decadent. For entrees we ordered the salmon and monkfish. Definitely the best monkfish I have ever had. It was served in an elegant silver casserole dish, something you'd see being used at the royal wedding, and it was served atop foraged and exotic mushroom ragout with fine herbs, shallots and garlic. So deliciously mouthwatering; cooked perfectly. I'd recommend a hundred times over.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"This place was amazing. The food was so fresh and on point. The smoked salmon cake out in a bowl and as the top lifted it smelled like a camp fire. The lobster was great. You can get all kinds of lobster in Boston, but it was really good here. Service was very slow and the wine list didn't have very many value wines. It was a great wine list with hard to get selections, but I look for the value without the ridiculous up charge. For sure this is a place to visit while in Boston.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"I am so glad I finally made it to Ostra, because it is now one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. Owned under the same restaurant group as other favorites like Mooo and Sorellina, I had high expectations for Ostra.The restaurant is elegant, chic, modern, and with high ceilings. They seated my dining partner and I upon arrival. The wine list is extensive with a wide range of prices. The complimentary bread was also soft and warm. I have to give credit for our wonderful waiter, who was incredibly courteous and attentive the whole night without being overbearing.I ordered a grilled sea bass, and it was so light and flavorful. The portion was huge too. This is probably the best seafood restaurant in Boston, and I can't wait to be back.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"Ostra is on a whole level above most other restaurants in Boston. If you look at the other places I've reviewed in this area, I do give out several five star reviews. However, Ostra goes so above and beyond any of those restaurants! The whole experience was incredible from start to finish.First, the physical restaurant is a work of art. Fish themed decor to match the food is elegant yet trendy. All of the staff is extremely respectful and polite and is willing to do anything to make the experience the best it can be. This restaurant is quite fancy, to say the least. I have been to multiple Michelin Star restaurants before, and although Ostra is not on that level, I would say it approaches that degree of excellence.I need to first mention that this is a long meal. If you don't expect this length (2-3 hours) it may come as a shock, but it is just a part of the experience. The menu is predominantly fish, but there are also other options, vegetarian and other meat. Some highlights include the King Crab, the salt crusted fish for two (I don't remember the name), and the chocolate torte for dessert. The food is rather expensive, but every dish was incredible.Overall, Ostra is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in the Boston area. I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a high class dining experience for a special occasion!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"12/17What a fantastic experience! Beautiful ambience yet not stuffy. Excellent service. Hands down, one of the best seafood experiences we have ever had! Succulent oysters and perfectly prepared scallops! We joined a couple of friends for dinner and the oohs and ahhs spoke for themselves! Upon entry your greeted with a display of fresh fish on display. It's not cheap and you really don't care because the quality is top notch! We will definitely come back when we return to Boston! Seafood heaven!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"The food is excellent. I love the lobster and paella. The truffle fries, I'm addicted. Moist and served in decent portions, contrary to usual fine dining. The staff is very nice. The only con is the dress code. Expect to see patrons wearing jeans and a hoodie.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"Everything was delicious! We came here as a party of 4. We booked a table through open table the night before (we ate on Monday night at 7pm). If you don't have a car, the restaurant is right between the bolyston and Arlington green t stations.Once you enter, you're greeted by a smiling hostess who asks to take your jackets/bags. Once seated, we were in awe of the restaurant interior design. Everything was simple and nice.But anyways on to the food. Because that's what we're all here for. We ordered 4 appetizers: kale cesear salad, snow pea salad, campanelle, and the calamari. Both the salads were delicious! The amount of dressing was just enough. The snow pea salad was chopped finely and tasted very fresh. The calamari was also delicious, not overly greasy or rubbery tasting. Even the complimentary bread was good and freshly warmed.On to the main dishes, there was a custom vegetarian dish (not on the menu, but just ask for it), grilled sea bream, paella, and pan roasted halibut. Everything again was delicious. I cannot explain it, you just have to go try it for yourself.Lastly dessert! We ordered the apple spice cake and the snow egg. I think the snow egg would be better with a mint sauce instead of basil, but it was personal preference. Both desserts were again delicious but Â the apple spice cake was the favorite for the table.Overall food was amazing. Service was superb. The restaurant was clean and modern. Definitely will come back to try new and have the same dishes!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"This restaurant is great at what they do. Â Each time i go it's just as enjoyable. Â With a pair of friends, the evening can last 4 hours if you get a few bottles of champagne and wine to accompany the meals. Â The seafood selection and preparation is very well done. If you're planning on getting a bottle of wine, appetizers, meals and deserts for two people, expect +\-$350.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"4,"We came here for my Birthday and since it was a cold rainy Tuesday it wasn't packed. We chose a seat on the lounge side with live piano music. Ambient was definitely on point!We ordered a dozen oysters (mix of both from MA) and the sea bass tartare. Oysters were really fresh and briny and the tartare was light and we gobbled that up fast!Next we ordered the grilled Spanish octopus and paella. The octopus was very tender and not at all chewy or tough. We shared the paella because our server said is on the big side. Lucky she told us that because it was definitely for 2. It's loaded with mussels, clams, fish, shrimp and a small lobster tail. Delicious! A lot of time paella is on the salty side because of the salt from the seafood but this one was seasoned perfectly.We only had a cocktail each and then sparkling wine and liquor, but the cocktails we had were tasty! So it's good to even visit for an after work cocktail.We will definitely be back in the summer when it's hit dreary outside.They also have valet for those who likes door to door service.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,Great Food. Love the Appetizers PastaFishPaella Â Best Seafood Restaurant in Boston,Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"5,"My girl and I haven't seen each other for 3 months. We ate and yapping from 7:30pm to 11pm. Delicious food, we like everything we ordered. Refreshing and not too heavy. Excellent service",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"4,"A delicious meal for a special occasion. We came here for a double birthday dinner and I was graciously treated this meal by my dining partner. For four, the bill came out to around $500, but we all ordered drinks, appetizers, entree, and dessert each, and left stuffed (unlike at many other special occasion restaurants where the portions are tiny and 'French'). First, the atmosphere is classy without being stuffy. Everyone dining was older (or young couples with their parents), since the restaurant IS expensive, but the service wasn't uptight and gave us breathing room to enjoy our meal. We started off with table bread, which was soft, well-seasoned, and...so delicious I almost ate the entire loaf by myself. My drink was DELICIOUS (I forget what it was called- something ""maid""); I was able to enjoy it and its after-effects happily. I tried the snow pea salad, grilled octopus, and a bit of the gnocchetti as appetizers. The octopus was simply some of the best I've ever had. For our main dish, I ordered the monkfish while my dining partners ordered the seafood paella, filet mignon, and chicken. I tried all but the chicken, and it was all delicious - the paella especially was huge, and I still have leftovers. I picked the monkfish on a whim, and the portion was huge - but I thought it was a bit on the salty side. For dessert, I really wanted the snow egg...but they were out!!! We were relegated to ordered the almond cake & chocolate tarte. As consolation, we were given an order of sorbet. My almond cake was delectable, and I usually don't love cake. We finished the meal with silver-dusted truffles. Overall, a delightful culinary experience, with the price tag to show it. But if there's a special occasion, this is a great place to celebrate it.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"4,"Let me start off by saying that this place definitely has the sophisticated, upscale atmosphere, which is showcased in their menu offering (and price point). My fiancÃ© and I came here for dinner and we ordered a few first courses, an entree, and a dessert. Here are my reviews on each of the food we had:1. Grilled Spanish Octopus (first course): Nice apps, too salty in my opinion.2. Fettuccine: If you like truffle or mushrooms in general, I'd highly recommend this one. 3. Alaskan King Crab Tortellini: A must-have! Rich, creamy sauce, not-too heavy in my opinion. The best course we ordered!4. Fillet Branzino (not the Salted Crusted one): Fresh fish, great taste, should be the restaurant's specialty, a bit too salty and sour in my opinion though.5. Snow Egg (dessert): delicate design, appreciate different ingredients within the plate.Giving them a 4-star because I found that most of the food was too salty for my taste. Hope it was just by chance. Other than that, I think they used a great variety of spices that were perfect for a seafood course. In terms of service, we had an instance where the server gave us a new plate yet it was still wet that we had to drain the water by ourselves before eating on it :( Totally not a big deal, but we had expected a stellar service at a restaurant like Ostra. It was a fine experience overall, but it did not extremely stood out. I would come back in the future though, hopefully with a less salty food and a better service!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"1,"Review - 3 starsIt was our second time at Ostra after celebrating our Christmas dinner. The first time experience was amazing: from food, service to execution of each meal. Second time, we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and all the experience was disappointing. Food was pretty good, but service was horrible. There was a huge waiting time between appetizers and food. We ordered a bottle of wine. We had to serve our own wine. The waiter only came to remove the bottle of wine from our table. The waiter disappeared throughout the whole time. We just flew back from a long trip just to celebrate our anniversary, and we had high expectations from this place. If we knew we were going to get this service at this place, we would just have eaten at some good local restaurant.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"4,"Wonderful space in the Boston Seaport area. My friend & I sat at a communal table, which added to the overall experience. Usually am not a fan of tapas, but the plates were right-sized and with 4 plates between us, we were relatively full. Highly recommend the chicken meatballs and the shrimp plate. On a nice day, you've got the choice of sitting outside in the patio area, though the wait can be pretty long. Other plus is that the location is close to a lot of other bars / shops.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"3,"Dinner for one this evening, I was offered a seat at the bar or one of the communal tables rather than a two-top. Which is fine, just worth noting. The menu at the bar is the complete menu and the service was great. They have a couple of Greek beers and lots of cocktails.""Avocado 'Tarama' Toast"" to start was delicious. Roe, cherry tomatoes, chili flakes and lemon relish with some greens on top. Great flavor and enjoyed it, other than it's a little tough to slice into and eat. I managed not to spill it everywhere but it was challenging.Main course, the ""Spanakopita Trout"" was a decent piece of trout with spanakopita filling and pickled sea fennel on top. The fish and the filling were great and I enjoyed them thoroughly. The sea fennel is nice to look at, but the pickling was so sharp that it overwhelmed the rest of the plate. I ended up pushing most of it to the side.I'd say, Committee was A-OK.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"I came here with a work colleague for dinner. I've got to say, I'm not usually a fan of shareable food / tapas, but Committee was fantastic! In particular, the grilled calamari on a bed of fava was delicious, as was the ground beef kebab.They have a nice little patio outside and all in all the food is also a great value (we shared 6 plates and drinks and the tab was just over $60 each). Highly recommended!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"I've passed by Committee for a few times everytime I'm around Seaport area for either work or leisure, and for some reason have always thought of the place as more of a coffee shop. When I found out they serve Greek cuisine with a Contemporary American twist, I got genuinely curious to try and overall I had a great experience! We got here for a Saturday brunch and ordered a few items off the menu: Spanakopita Grilled Cheese (which was excellent - and I actually liked it better than traditional version!) has a nice addition of sauteed spinach and classic tomato soup. We also ordered the Zucchini chips, which was light and great for starter. A visit to a Greek-inspired joint won't be complete without sampling their Mezze - and Committee's had an interesting twist of pineapple which we quite enjoyed. Interiors-wise, the place has a great industrial vibe. It's very laidback, casual, yet classy enough to send a message as one of the eateries to watch in Seaport area. Great for big groups as well as they have plenty of long, communal style seating throughout the space!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"Went here for an early dinner with a friend and will absolutely be back.Following other reviewers, we started with the tzatziki trio. I was a little nervous because one was supposed to be spicy but I ended up liking that one the best, but all three were fantastic. They came with the most perfectly soft and toasty pitas. We also ordered the Mango Melitzanosalata, which I would not order again. The fried bread it came with was dense and dry and the dip was just average. Next came the star of the show, the tyropita. It was so good we debated ordering a second. DO NOT MISS THIS. 10/10. We also ordered the beets and the zucchini crisps for an infusion of vegetables and both were delicious. Finally, we ordered the keftedakia, which I would probably not order again because they were much spicier than I prefer and were a little dry, though the flavor was good. I would love to go back to try some other dishes. For dessert we ordered the baklava cheesecake which was really good but by that point I was too full to properly enjoy it.The atmosphere is industrial and though we went early so it was not crowded, the tables appeared very close together and the hightops are separated only by little plants on a long table so I can see it getting very noisy when it's busy. I also do not care for being that close to other patrons. The service was great, both at the bar before we were seated and the waitstaff.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"WOW!!! Another credit to Boston in how it has changed for the better, way better. Bless the soul of Mayor Thomas Menino who really started the seaport / waterfront development.There was about seven of us guys reunited. We all grew up together as kids and I was lucky to see so many over the time I was visiting. We sat in the spacious lounge area of Committee and drank, ate, and were very merry! So happy to see each other, catch up and talk trash.Went through a lot of food and wine. At least 5 bottles of some delicious Greek reds. Then food was flowing - Octopus, shrimp skordo, Spanakopita Trout, Artichoke Moussaka, some other items, and of course...Poikilia Kreaton which is a combo of grilled meats: souvlaki, lamb kebab, chicken souvlaki, loukaniko, bifteki served withpatates tiganites, grilled pita, tyrokafteri, and tzatziki.Great service and very spacious!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"Outstanding dinner at Committee on a Wednesday night. We loved the decor and ambiance! Our server was so friendly and attentive. We had the tzatziki trio which featured regular, spicy and passion fruit tzatziki. They were all great but we especially enjoyed the passion fruit. We also the grape leaves which had raisins and added a good sweetness. The absolute best dish of the night was the souvlaki (grilled lamb skewers). Perfect cooked with little charred bits, lots of flavor and cut like butter. Served with plain tzatziki and a wedge of lemon, absolutely perfect. Highly recommend!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,Great brunch! Came here for a brunch event and very pleasantly surprised. Everything from the eggs and bacon to the spanokopita and yummy cocktails were spot on. Wherever they get their bacon from needs to be my new go-to shop - sooo good.,Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"One of my favorite brunch spots in Boston!Came here a couple of times and would totally recommend the yogurt pancakes, the shakshuka if you're sharing, and of course the zucchini chips. Grape leaves and the french toast are average. The atmosphere is pretty nice and I like the decoration.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"3,"Committee was a destination for a recent post work event greeting new employees and summer interns. Â The establishment is in the Seaport District of Boston which is a hip, new destination of restaurants, bars, coffee shops along with a growing number of businesses, apartments, and condominiums. Â While we did have a section of the establishment cornered off for our private party, service was attentive and plentiful. Â Drinks, largely draft and craft beers, wines, with some cocktails, were eagerly refilled although wait times were longer than expected. Â Servers were also working through the crowd of 20-25 participants for the 5-7PM event with various hors d'oeuvres. Â The space itself it great with a modern industrial design and energetic vibe. Â The Mediterranean concept of sharing small plates is a popular one that committee also does well. Â We sampled and shared many traditional vegetable, meat and fish platters passed around by the staff. Â Even an accidental collision that caused a spill was quickly attended to by multiple staff, cleaned and restored to normalcy. Â Thank you to committee for providing a hospitable location to meet new colleagues and welcome them.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"Great food and service. Only bummer is the reservation system. I was kind of surprised to hear them asking for my credit card details while making a reservation. They would charge me $25 if my party doesnt show up. Thats really new for me. When we arrived for brunch, the entire indoor seating was empty and some of the outdoor seating was empty as well. We wanted to sit outside but they said that only indoor seating is possible. The drinks and food were really nice, specially the Shakshouka was spicy and yummy. We also ordered pancakes and waffles, both of them were delicious too.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"I was working an event at the convention center and was staying at the Westin in the Seaport District in Boston. I have a lot of friends who live in Boston so one of my girls recommended we meet at Comittee. We were originally supposed to meet at The Gathering across the street but it was a Monday night and The Gathering was completely empty, however across the street at Comittee was Poppin, in a great way. I took an Uber over to Comittee to meet my friend, I was able to walk right in. There were several birthday parties going on as well as the place was packed. I had never heard of Comittee before and wasn't sure what type of food it was. What I was sure of is if they had a cow on the menu I could've probably eaten it. I was busy all day and didn't get a chance to eat once. What I knew for sure is that I needed a big martini the size of my face and tons of food. I was really excited to hear that it was a tapas restaurant because I have always enjoyed that style of eating. We ordered the three dip plate that is served with delicious toasted bread. We also order the taziki and chicken skewers. We got the salmon tartare which was delicious. With these four dishes, we were more than full. The drinks were delicious. We had martinis and wine. Our server was awesome. He was in his early 20s and hilarious. Definitely made the experience even better. I was so wrapped up in my food and drink I forgot to take any photos, but trust me. This place is definitely worth it. It is decorated so cool, definitely a hip and trendy Boston restaurant. Prices are affordable especially with how delicious the food is. Bon appÃ©tit.Since this experience I have been back twice, the first time I was out to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, we were able to walk right in and we were given a great spot right in the entrance with our own couch and booth. Without a reservation, it was really nice to have that kind of special service. Our server was Max who was great and very attentive to the birthday girl, he even brought out a delicious flourless chocolate cake for the occasion.The second time I was out with a big group of friends, some are my family and friends from Boston and I also had some friends from Los Angeles in. This time was a little bit trickier because it was a Saturday night at around 8:30 pm. We made a reservation at the door and the host said that it might be an hour to an hour and a half. We were going to be starving by that point, but we put in my name and hoped for the best. We walked to the bar and had a few drinks. I had to check on our table twice, the time kept changing. 45 minutes, a half hour, at this point we asked the host if he could recommend a place nearby that might be a little bit less busy. We decided to stay, and 20 minutes later we were escorted to our table. The food was delicious as always. It is Mediterranean, tapas style so the six of us were able to pass around dishes and all share them and talk about the food. Since we had already been at the bar for two hours, we didn't get any drinks and our tab was only $100. We were able to eat in less than an hour and we were on our way. The service was OK this time. Overall, I always have a good time when I come here. The environment is great, it is in the up and coming downtown Seaport area. I highly recommend joining the Committee!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"3,"The restaurant is trendy, friendly, and spacious, but I thought the food was underwhelming considering the hype around it.Upon arrival, we were seated immediately. However, they sat us as a table right next to the bar so there were people hovering over the entire night.The waiter was friendly, and everyone at the restaurant was attentive. My dining partner and I ordered the chicken meatballs, the cauliflowers the lamb, the grilled eggplants, and the grilled squid.The prices are OK for Boston, but the portions for the vegetables were laughable. Everything was very salty and lacked depth. With the abundance of restaurants in Boston, I am not particularly excited to come back and try anything.

The moussaka was moist and delicious with an interesting combination of spices. The pita for the gyros was homemade and delicious. Unfortunately, the lamb was disappointing, composed of bland ground lamb without anything resembling a Gyros taste. Service was good and the bathrooms were very clean. Paid parking is present nearby.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"Great location! Love it. Food service was prompt. We had the Tyropita, was delicious but a little disappointed it was flash fried rather then oven baked, zucchini crisps were decent with a tasty yogurt, asparagus fritters were downright bitter and tasted like wet, freshly mowed grass (what I would imagine it was like lol) as well as the Souvlaki- medium rare and spiced to perfection, a definite must have. I definitely want to go back and give it another shot, as I so want to be wowed by the menu to match the location and overall feel of the seaport.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"Waked in one evening and were lucky to get a table outside - gorgeous weather! The food lived up to its hype. We had the fried okra, corn and lamb souvlaki - all excellent choices. We will be back!!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"I'm used to small and bad Greek restaurants but thanks to Committee I surely changed my opinion. We had fried feta, pork and beef meatballs. Everything was excellent..also we were in Seaport so great location",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"If you're looking for a slightly upscale Greek restaurant with a great atmosphere - this is your spot. I came here for Sunday brunch with a large group (10 people) and they were very accommodating. They take reservations, and were fully prepared with a table in the private room near the back of the restaurant. Service was terrific.To start, they bring you complimentary cranberry bread and fig dip - a fun twist on your normal bread and butter. The best dishes were definitely the shakshouka and the baklava oatmeal, and the zucchini crisps were great for sharing. I wouldn't recommend the Spanikopita grilled cheese - it was good, but nothing special! Tasted like a normal grilled cheese and tomato soup combo, and the tomato soup was thicker than I like it to be. All of the drinks were creative and delicious.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"First time trying Greek brunch and it was a great experience! Came here with some friends on a Saturday morning and they seated us immediately. The restaurant is located in Seaport and has very beautiful industrial decor with a wide range of seating options. I highly recommend the shakshouka. We split it between two people and it was more than enough food. Also, the bread they bring out in the beginning is amazing. Service here was excellent and the waiters were very attentive. Will definitely be coming back to try their dinner menu!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"First - I don't know why Yelp list this as not kid friendly, they have a dedicated kids menu. Seems pretty kid friendly to me. I guess if you lack parenting skills and your kid(s) an unruly jerk who you let run free, the 'Not Kid Friendly' rating is aimed squarely at you. On to the service: Amazing. Even on a busy evening they were extremely accommodating and found space for myself and two elementary aged kids. The service as a whole was more akin to what one would expect from a much pricier establishment. I mentioned my daughter loved the vegetables that came with my plate and they brought a side of vegetable for her. The food: the filet was like butter. No pressure on the knife to cut it and it melted in my mouth. As mentioned, the vegetables were cooked perfectly (just a little bite to them). I will return here anytime I'm in Boston.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Cozy spot in Beacon Hill just north of the Common. Also, it's a block or so away from Cheers, in case you want to do some sightseeing on the way over. I read that the owner of 75 own cheers and a few other spots as well. My first recommendation is to make a reservation on opentable.com. I seem to always plug the site but it saves me time and that hangry look I get from my kids. The place of very intimate. If you are dining, you will most likely be within a 1/2 arms length of any other guests. There are a few smaller tables that offer more room. The bar is a decent size. They have 3 TVs and seating along bar, window, and alongside dining area. When you walk inside there is a table of cheese and crackers that are available to all. Drinks are reasonably prices. Pretty much all beers have ranged from $7-9 and cocktails Â $11-15. For those of you traveling with kids. They do accommodate and very kid friendly. Kid's menu and kid's cups available. I was surprised to learn about this when reading reviews because of the type of restaurant I thought it was, upscale and romantic. It can be a place for a Â date night with some charm, like the several couples we saw or the spot young party goers meet up. Great places for all ages and sizes. The food is exceptional here. I had my eye on the Nantucket seafood stew and the waiter, Jay recommended it as well. Hearty chunks of fish, carrots, potatoes, with 2 pieces each of shrimp and scallops, with several muscles. The stew's broth was flavorful and not overpowering with that seafood taste. My kids went with the pasta. I had to try it since it looked like long curls. My wife said it looked Shirley temple like. The pasta was very good and cooked right. My wife had the ribeye cooked to perfection. For dessert we tried the German Apple strudel with cinnamon ice cream. Oh man, the cinnamon ice cream can stand on its own. Perfect pairing of the two. If you're looking for something different in Boston and want to get away from the more touristy spots by the wharf and North end, then I suggest dining here. Spend some time at the Boston Common and make your way over. Happy eating!",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"1,"Just pathetic. Came for brunch and ordered the only two unique New England (lobster) items on the menu: the lobster omelette and Benedict. The only good thing I have to say is that the salad green garnish tasted great.1. The lobster may or may not have been fresh, the cheese in the omelette didn't go well with lobster and it was rubbery. And the sausage links were questionable... which means inedible. The potatoes were equivalent to a greasy diner serving of hash browns. 2. My boyfriend and I left certain that we were able to prepare a better omelette at home. With a better presentation. 3. Folks at the table next to us didn't clear their plates either and left in a hurry. One guest asked for hot sauce and the waiter told him to pick a bottle from the Bloody Mary bar for himself...implying that the guest would have to LEAVE HIS SEAT to serve himself.4. When a brunch place is empty with no line but asks if you have a reservation, you just have to laugh.We should have just been patient and waited in line at Tatte or Paramount for proper brunch.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"4,"What a cute American restaurant in Beacon Hill. There is unlimited cheese and crackers, and the free bread that they serve you is nice and warm! There was just one kind of cheese cut into cubes, and it was a great way to keep me happy. There is a small bar area with TV screens, a lot of people were watching the game and cheering. It can get loud during games. If you can score a table by the window, you can people watch. There is a good cocktail list- I went with the Bloody Mary, which was delicious. For my main course, I had the seafood stew. There was a ton of fish in it, and 1 shrimp, and a few mussels. The fish was kinda dry, and not very pleasant to eat. You can also join the 75 club to get special benefits!",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"4,"I had Atlantic Cod, 75 French cocktail, and Creme Brulee. Everything was great. I especially like the cocktail. I am not really big fan of alcohol, just a social drinker. So this time I had cocktail with dinner. It was refreshing and nice taste for summer. Cod with veges were also great but could have been little more powerful. Desert was also good. The interior was really cozy and very Boston type restaurant. I will come back to try another menu.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"4,"I came here on a wintry spring day with a friend - I had never heard of it, but as she is a Beacon Hill native, she knew of this gem, off the beaten path of the well traversed Charles Street. We happened to be here on a Tuesday, and in celebration of Taco Tuesday, we both got tacos and I got a margarita while she enjoyed a Corona. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy and warm, and the staff were very sweet and attentive. I thanked my friend profusely for sharing her favorite Beacon Hill spot with me - definitely a place I'll be returning to again and again.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"5,"It is 10 Fahrenheit (-12 Celsius) and sunny today in Boston. In these conditions, the only thing that makes sense is to get brunch at 75 Chestnut! We sat at the bar under the large window with a great view of the historic brick buildings and trees across the street. Â Kenneth was our bartender and took our orders. I recommend sitting at the bar for and brunch. Eggs Benedict with salmon - marvelous panoply of yum, especially when beer lovers combine it with an Irish Goodbye cocktail. Professional bartenders provide a whole different level of brunch and booze service. If I lived here, I would definitely become a regular here. Food and hospitality is excellent. Such a nice Street and the design inside is great. Highly recommended to sit at home the high seats under the big bay window.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"4,"A snowy Sunday in Boston could have kept us cooped up in our hotel room. What a meal this was! Highly recommended by both Yelp and a friend, 75 Chestnut did not disappoint when we needed a Beacon Hill brunch on a Sunday morning. Walking distance from our hotel, 75C is tucked away in a quaint residential area of Beacon Hill that transforms you back to a foregone New England era. Â Everything about this experience was spot on. Seated quickly (thankfully because it got crazy busy!). Bloody Mary bar was on point. Homemade sticky buns to start - incredible. Lobster omelette, so fresh and tasty. Â I had no complaints about my experience and wish I frequented Boston more so I could enjoy 75C more often. Hope to be back here soon and can't wait to enjoy another great meal. I'd like to try their lunch or dinner. If it's half as good as brunch, this place is would earn a five star ranking from me.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Nice location, relaxed ambiance, great menu, delicious food, attentive service. Have been here three times and enjoyed my visits every time. Will come back and would recommend",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"4,"75 Chestnut flawlessly establishes an atmosphere of both class and comfort. Cozily situated in one of Beacon Hill's more residential laneways, the picturesque restaurant embodies everything Boston: cute, comfy, and colonial...with the Pats playing on the bar television. While visiting a friend, her parents treated us to Sunday brunch at 75 Chestnut. They made reservations ahead of time, and I'd highly suggest doing the same if you're planning a weekend brunch. There didn't seem to be a terrible wait, but the place was definitely bustling. Their menu was brilliant. I'm often either overwhelmed or underwhelmed with menu choices, especially for brunch places, but I'm sure Goldilocks would agree that 75 Chestnut's menu was just right. Good balance of sweet/ savory / breakfast/ lunch. I hate tomato juice, but my table-mates ordered Bloody Mary's. These beautiful cocktails made me wish I liked tomato juice. You have the option to make your own or leave it to the bar. Both let the bartenders mix their Mary's. My friend mentioned she wished it was a little spicier, and when she sent it back to the bar to add an extra kick, they added chili flakes instead of a splash of tabasco as one might expect. My friend stated that these chili flakes gave the drink a weird gritty texture. That didn't stop her from drinking the whole thing.I ordered the spicy chicken sausage hash; a beautiful blend of potatoes, spicy chicken sausage, veggies, eggs your way, and hollandaise sauce. The potatoes were slightly undercooked. However, overall I was very pleased (and satiated for the remainder of the day!!) My friend enthusiastically ordered the $20 lobster benedict. She stated she'd ordered this in the past, and her only complaint was her eggs were overcooked. Last time, she didn't say anything, but 75 Chestnut ended up comping the dish. She was willing to give it another try. When her dish came, it was beautifully plated with heaps of lobster, but as soon as she cut into her poached eggs, she knew they were overcooked. She was able to pull the yolk out. She sent it back, specifically asking for runny yolks. When the plate came back, one egg was perfectly cooked, but the second, again, was overcooked. At this point, I think she just wanted to eat her breakfast, so she didn't speak up. But honestly, that's where the missing star comes in. Maybe stray from the benedict? There's lots of other good choices.Overall, 75 Chestnut is a solid eatery for a good brunch. Service was good, food was tasty, vibe is casual yet sophisticated. On the pricier side (at least by my Philadelphia standards)/ around $25-30 per person, and parking in this area is pretty tricky. Near some cute little shopping areas and Boston Common if you fancy a post-meal stroll. I'd absolutely come back.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"5,Hidden GEM. This place is amazing. Great date place. Beautiful location in Beacon Hill. I've been 2-3 times and will definitely go back. Make reservations.,75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"3,"Came here on a Saturday night with a friend. The restaurant itself was super cute and cozy with dim lighting and a pretty extensive menu. The food was not as pricey as I was expecting for how nice of a restaurant it is, which was nice. FOOD: My friend ordered the Marinated Tenderloin Tips, which she said was alright. I, on the other hand, was thoroughly disappointed by the Atlantic Cod Filet that I ordered. It was pretty bland and tasteless and the beans were undercooked. Do not recommend that dish. Overall, the restaurant is really cute but the food was underwhelming.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Nice little restaurant in the Beacon Hill area. Had a very nice local vibe tucked away in a residential neighborhood. Our group of 4 sat near the front entrance window so we could look outside and see all of the nice homes, trees and people walking by. I ordered the filet mignon ($32) which was a smaller portion size believe 6-8oz but it was still flavorful. I opted for the mashed potatoes instead of roasted potatoes. The meat was tender, juicy and delicious! To drink I had the watermelon jalapeno margarita. Hits the spot if you like a nice spicy kick to your drinks! Others in my group tried the clam chowder, steamed mussels, and seafood stew. We all enjoyed our meals. Service was fast and friendly. Dinner for 4 w/ drinks was $180 + tip.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"5,Amazing hidden gem food is off the charts. Bountiful delicious and beautifully presented and displayed.

Â I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and they were extremely accommodating. Â I asked before hand if they could bring a little dessert out with a candle at the end of our meal and requested a seat by the window. Â We had a reservation for 6:30 and were stuck in traffic so I called to let them know we would be late and the woman on the phone was extremely helpful and moved us to another table in the bar area by the window so we wouldn't be rushed out by a party arriving after us. Â Once we arrived, she was so sweet and went out of her way to make sure that the new table we were seated at was okay.We had such a cute view of the brownstones across the street through the large window we were seated at. Â Our waiter was very attentive and checked on us multiple times to see if we needed anything else (but not in an over bearing, annoying way).The food was very good, I got the lobster gnocchi special and my boyfriend got the tenderloin steak tips. Â The only negative thing I'd have to say was in my meal, the lobster was just a small tail that hardly had any meat in it. Â I was a disappointed by the size but it still tasted great.We will definitely be back again soon to try more menu options!",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"3,"Food: 3.5/5Service: 4/5Atmosphere: 5/5Value: 3.5/5The restaurant, both outside and inside, and its neighborhood are very cute. The atmosphere at 75 is intimate and quaint, but at the same time casual, which made for a lovely setting for our friend's birthday dinner. The food was definitely a little overpriced, but is to be expected for the location. We got the steamed mussels, chicken sausage pasta, pumpkin ravioli, and fish&chips. The chicken sausage pasta had good flavor - really loved the little squash pieces in it - but the chicken was dry. The fries for the fish&chips were a little bland and sad. Overall, there wasn't anything too special about the food, especially for the price, but I would come again to try the drinks, brunch menu, or for the ambience. Our server was very nice and accommodating though. When we told her secretly that it was our friend's birthday, she presented the molten chocolate cake with a candle and scoops of whipped cream & ice cream and took the order off the check. All in all, we had a good time and good conversations. I would just say to CHECK THE BILL because three of us ordered the chicken sausage pasta, which on the menu said $24.90, but we were charged $32.95/dish. We would've paid a good extra $30 if someone in our group hadn't caught that error. We were also charged $2 for ""miscellaneous food items,"" which was probably for the bread and is totally fine, but wish they could've told us. It put a little damper on the night, but mistakes happen and at least our server was quick to correct the bill.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"1,"According to yelp 75 Chestnut was a steakhouse. Sadly their uninspired menu only had one steak on the menu. The rest of the menu was as stated above, uninspired and lacked originality. Our waitress provided her recommendations, all of which fell short. From the wine, which she must have drank a bottle before making said recommendation because she clearly forgot how bad it was, stated was the ""most popular"" to the salad with everything but the kitchen sink...and our main entree which was the saddest excuse for seafood stew I've ever come across. Needless to say we do not recommend nor will we be returning to 75 Chestnut.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"4,"This is exactly what I needed my first night in Boston. I had bookmarked this location well in advance of the trip so that we had a backup plan for meals as soon as we landed.I was super hungry after the flight so we dropped our bags off at our AirBnB and headed over to 75 Chesnut. It was a short walk from our place so that was a major advantage. When we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. Since our bodies were still on west coast time we were quite early for dinner. The menu looked great and it was hard to choose. They had some Mardi Gras specials which the wife was intrigued by. I went for the sirloin steak tips and fries because steak sounded way too good to pass up!The portion was a nice size - perfect for after travel. Enough food to fill me up but not so much food I wanted to fall asleep at the table. Our drinks never went empty but the waiter was not overbearing either. The wife ordered the jambalaya but found it lacking on the heat. She was looking forward to a kick in the tastebuds and felt it fell quite flat. We both opted for dessert to top off the night. I went with the apple strudel. Wonderful. The flaky top was a nice crunch over the yummy, mushy apple and spice inside.It was the prefect portion of food after a day of travel and a pre-sleep. By the time we finished our meal the place was quite packed. Great vibe though. Laughter and chatter all around.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"4,"One of the best restaurants in Beacon Hill. Located right in the middle of a residential neighborhood, the atmosphere is super cozy and is overflowing with typical Beacon Hill charm. We arrived a little early for our 8:45 reservation on a Friday night and were seated right away. They have a lovely little cheese and cracker display while you wait. The restaurant is pretty small so there isn't a whole lot of waiting room. Once we were seated our server was really friendly and attentive. We each had a cocktail which were both very strong and pretty pricey, though that should be expected at a place like this. For our meals, I had the pumpkin ravioli and my husband had the turkey pot pie which was really more of a turkey soup. Both meals were great and the portions were large. Overall I am really glad that I have this restaurant in my neighborhood and will be back for sure.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"5,"I'm a big fan of 75 Chestnut! I come here often and am a member of their ""75 Club"" which gets you a free appetizer when you sign up, then 15% off the bill the month of your birthday. Not a bad perk.The bar area is generally buzzing, and they have great (and strong) drinks. The free cheese and crackers are quite the perk too. Downside, prices are a little high - but the food is pretty good. I've had quite a few of their salads and sandwiches, and never been disappointed. Most recently, the steak sandwich was actually one piece of steak, as opposed to tiny or sliced pieces. It's a good sign when you're asked how you want your steak sandwich cooked! One of the best options for a meal in Beacon Hill, in my opinion.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Coppa is one of my favorite Italian places in Boston.Order anything here, but especially the pastas, for everything is amazing. If it's possible, sit outside-- it's a nice neighborhood and feels especially peaceful and maybe even a bit like Italy.For an appetizer, try the meatballs, which are delicious. I would avoid the grilled Caesar salad-- I believe that Gordon Ramsey has a mean little bit about restaurants that serve this item; I found the salad fine but just didn't think it was worth the price.The desserts are excellent as well. Try the affogato or the creme fraiche.This place is particularly a gem because it's just one block over from Barcelona but way better (obviously in different categories, of course). The wait staff have been very kind and courteous.It's a small establishment, so calling ahead or reserving is always a good idea.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"My friends choose this place since, according their review, they make the best Aperol.The restaurant is pretty small. Inside, in addition to the bar, there are several tables. Outside - about 5-6 tables. The restaurant itself is located in a cozy place in Southie.On weekends I advise you to come 15-20 minutes earlier to put your name in the wait list. We were told that all tables tables are booked, so the seats will be only outside. My advice: book a table in advance.First of all, we ordered Aperol. I have never tried it before, so I do not have anything to compare with. In general, it was quite tasty.My friends ordered several dishes. According to them, the ribs were slightly overdried, and the meta balls did not differ from those that can be bought in the supermarket.In general, the place is good and cozy. Prices are available. I'm unlikely to come here again, since I did not get caught here. But I will definitely recommend it.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"1,"Why are the waiters so nice and appropriate? And the management so clueless and callous! When I told them what had happened with my dish. I was told can't you see how busy we're? We have people waiting for these tables! I said so my needs are not appropriate? They are. Well then why can't you help us? The waitress said she wanted to but I must talk to management. So now I have talked to you. And been treated so poorly! Now I will tell everyone, unless you're a regular you're NOTHING!Good bye, COPPA!",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"I think all my photos speak for themselves, but I will add some color commentary here. From start to finish we had a spectacular experience. Coppa started accepting reservations recently, and the city of Boston lucked out. This intimate Enoteca on a quiet corner of the South End is an oasis of explosive flavor and fantastic service. We had an 8pm for 4, and they practically had to remove us from the building at closing time. I started off with the usual ""we are about to order a lot of food, no judgment"" to the waitress. I am not sure why I even feel the need to disclose that, because they probably love that we will up-sell ourselves. We started with drinks: aperol spritz of course for me, and my lovely friends tried the spritz with ginger and rhubarb. Next, we ordered our THIRTEEN ITEMS:Round One: Arancini, Meatballs, Castelvetrano Olives, Duck Prosciutto, Cheese Plate (one goat, one sheep, one cow), fresh bread. Round Two: cavatelli con pollo, carbonara, bone marrow pizza. Round Three: espresso. Round Four: tiramisu, zeppole. We ordered everything at once, and our server expertly timed it all perfectly where the dishes came out in a steady stream over the two hours. It was very much a dinner I remember having in Italy. The bone marrow pizza is life changing. The myriad of flavors is so unexpected and despite it being one of the last things we had, we all made room. I love heat, but will warn my fellow foodies that most of the dishes we had with red sauce had a kick to them, and the pizza had red pepper flakes. If you are anti-spicy, don't forget to ask for it on the side. I thought nothing could ever be the bone marrow pizza level of satisfaction for me, until the zeppole came out. Made with ricotta cheese and served with Nutella, these bad boys are so incredibly light and fluffy, and have not lost their character to the heavy weight of the fried exterior. Absolutely amazing.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"Tapas are always either a love/hate kind of experience. There is always a sort of game of chicken and math wizardry when it comes to splitting the portions. How will we split 3 pieces of asparagus between 4 people? Should I pull out the abacus? The service here is excellent, and outdoor dining is very comfortable in the summer. It's pretty dog friendly, as I see tons of dogs walk by and there are bowls of water for them. It can get busy, and a little crowded on the weekends. Our order was a little postponed since there was a huge order of pizza to go ahead of us. The waiter was really attentive and apologized for the tardiness. In terms of drinks, I thought having an option that is completely random called the Bartender's Whim was pretty excellent for a lazy person such as myself. The grapefruit Tom Collins ended up being super refreshing for the heat in the summer.For the food, I think the pasta was a little rushed. The noodles were thick, and I felt like some of them were a little undercooked. Couldn't really taste the sea urchin in the Carbonara con Riccio di Mare. If you are looking for the squid ink pasta, make sure to call ahead, since it is seasonal. The pizza was really good, and the funghi(mushroom) pizza was really fragrant. They did have the option to add truffle on it, but my other friends were cheapskates. I would recommend to ask for extra bread after every plate to soak up the extra sauce. The meat and cheese plates were recommended, but we ended up not getting it, because some people at my table believed we should go to a deli and make our own charcuterie later for cheaper. The pizzas and noodle dishes + copious amounts of bread and water should be filling enough for you before you go bankrupt. Overall, I thought it was alright, but I might walk a couple more blocks to the restaurant Barcelona.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"I came here for the second time (this first was 4 years ago!). I don't live in Boston, but it will now be my go to for great Italian food. The menu is tapas style, so they recommend you order 2-3 dishes per person. We came in for brunch, so we ordered off the regular menu as well as the brunch menu. The beef tartare, ribs, and the doughnuts were exceptional. The salad and pancakes were just okay. I can't wait to go back and try more off the regular menu.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"I was excited to try this place since it was recommended to me by a friend, but I was pretty disappointed. The hostess was nice enough, but the service was not the best, and the food itself failed to deliver. I ordered the bass as an appetizer and the citrus flavor overpowered everything else so I was left with an unbalanced medley of tang and salt in my mouth. For my entree, I had the prosciutto pizza and it was honestly nothing special.I went to Coppa on a rainy day so everyone opted to sit inside rather than outdoors. This made it very very loud, so I had to yell in order to be heard by my dinner partner. Overall, it was nothing to write home about.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"What a great little gem in the South End! This place has been on my list to try for a while, and I was definitely not disappointed. We started with a cheese+meat board and the duck prosciutto was a personal favorite. I also had the sea urchin carbonara, which was delicious from beginning to end. Lovely meal with exception service. Will definitely be back!",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"Hands down, Coppa is my favorite restaurant in all of Boston. This corner gem makes me so happy inside. The ambiance is comparable to none along with the food. Every single item on the menu is unbelievable. I recommend coming here for Brunch Lunch and Dinner! The workers are pleasant and they take reservations on the phone. I leave Boston today and miss Coppa already",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"Great Italian spot in the South End for brunch or dinner. Has a small NY restaurant vibe. Staff was super friendly and accommodating of any requests. We went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and got a great table by the window. Ordered the CORNMEAL PANCAKE which was really tasty. It was my first time having a pancake made out of cornmeal, but it was much lighter than a normal pancake, had fruit inside the batter and came with a fruit compote on top. Â Other more lunch/dinner items that we tried included: SCALLOP CRUDO and MEATBALLS. All was very good to share. I don't really even like scallops and it was so colorful and had such great flavor. Great place for a couples meal or girls night out.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"A nice cozy restaurant on a nice street corner. Coppa was good! But I think compared to all of the other pasta/pizza restaurants in Boston, it was pretty average. Also, for the price, I'm not sure it was worth. But this is also coming from a college student on a budget. We ordered...-Arancini di Fontal: fried risotto and cheese balls - can't go wrong with that. I liked that they weren't oily even though they were fried. -Bucatini Cacio e Pepe: the noodles were really good. I'm not sure if they were made in house, but the definitely tasted like it. -Parma: the prosciutto had a bit of an odd aftertaste but I loved the combination of flavors on this pizza-Nduja: good standard-tasting red sauce pizzaI'm not sure if I would come back here again but I do think it's worth trying once! The service was great too.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"1,"In town for the weekend from NYC and my partner and I decided to check out Coppa for dinner. We arrived and there were a couple of people sitting outside as well as inside with some a few open seats available. We get there and waited about 2 min for the hostess to greet us. Table for 2 we told her and she asked if we had reservations and we said no. She looked around and said these tables are reserved and we won't be able to sit you before the kitchen closes. So how is it that Coppa had 12 open seats but refused to sit my partner and I for dinner. You don't get that kind of treatment in NYC, which is basically the food capital of the world! I could understand if it's a large group but I'm pretty sure the restaurant could've made accommodations for 2. Customer service should always be priority and you should NEVER turn customers away.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"Not everyone deserves second changes (see Reek from GoT and OJ Simpson IRL) and Coppa might not either. Came here with my gf as she tried to reaffirm her faith in Ken Oringer establishments after a previously underwhelming experience and I too was left wondering if Coppa and Toro should take a paternity test.My gf made a reservation a few days ahead for a 7:30p reservation. The space is small but not claustrophobic, largely in part to the high ceilings, however make sure you don't trip anyone coming out of the kitchen as you wait in line for the single bathroom. Dumb enough to go out for dinner in single-digit weather, we were punished for our decision when we were seated adjacent to the front door. There is a double door, but the stream of reservation-less people in and out was enough to drop the temperature an uncomfortable amount. However there was a small space heater aimed at us, which teased comfort all night.Anyways, onto the food. We ordered the tartare di manzo, bistecca, polpette, lasagna di castana, italian grinder, and a nduja/parma pizza. The tartare was just ok, but the bistecca was amazing ordered rare. The polpette (meatballs) were juicy in the center, however both my gf and I agreed that the taste was solid but not much else. My gf was the only fan of the lasagna but not enough to want to pay $16 for a 2x2 square again. The half-nduja (sausage and burrata) and half-parma (prosciutto and arugula) pizza was a miss for both of us. The burrata was the only enjoyable part of an otherwise lackluster half, while the parma half was so salty and bitter that only a few bites were taken between us. FAIR WARNING: the crust comes very charred. The italian grinder arrived about the same time as the bill and was graciously comped, but otherwise nothing noteworthy to report.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"We were in the mood for a non-traditional/non-stuffy type place that served pasta and Coppa fit the bill. We put our names down for a table for two around 6:45 on a Saturday night and were quoted a 45-60 minute wait which turned out to be pretty accurate, as the space is tiny and very popular. For starters, we got two dishes: shaved artichokes with hummus and roe with everything bagel chips (what an unusual combination that turned out to be absolutely delicious and devoured within minutes), and lightly charred brussels with dijon mustard (which was also an interesting twist amongst all the balsamic brussels..a tad too strong on the horseradish though, so for those who can't handle things like wasabi, this may be too much for you). Both dishes were a great way to start our meal. For the mains, we had the urchin and pancetta spaghetti carbonara and cavatelli with chicken sausage. The carbonara was a touch too salty, but still enjoyable especially due to the fresh bouncy spaghetti. The cavatelli had very fresh and subtle flavors, likely coming from whatever spices are used to flavor the tiny bits of chicken sausage. There are no condiments on the table because you won't need any! As for drinks, we got a refreshing grapefruit sangria and a strawberry rhubarb panna cotta for dessert. I normally avoid rhubarb because I find it too tart, and I avoid panna catta because it's usually a bit chalky. Not the case here, every flavor was very well balanced and the panna cotta was smooth and had a very fresh, subtle cream taste. Last but not least, I want to give a big shout out to our server, Marisa. She (and the rest of the staff) were very considerate about my nut allergy and even offered to leave out the nuts from our dishes without me even asking (I know some restaurants are really against alterations/substitutions so I just avoid dishes with nuts altogether but I'm so glad I didn't have to miss out on any of the awesome dishes). Top that off with friendly service, good (and not too loud) music, on a cute and quaint corner in the South End, and you have yourself a perfect Saturday night dinner. I'm normally not into pricey hipster places that put a whole bunch of twists on traditional dishes (I get enough of that in Brooklyn) but Coppa pulls it all off perfectly and is worth every minute, calorie and dollar.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,When: 6:10 pm (Weekday)Wait time: No wait time (Made Reservation)The time it took to get the dish: 10-20 minutesVerdict:- Funghi in Salamoia: 4/5- Arancini di Fontal: 5/5- Uni Panino: 5/5- Salami Board sampler: 5/5- Parma Pizza: 4/5- Ambiance: 5/5- Service: 4/5- Price: 4/5Overall: 4.5/5 - Great!

BEST charcuterie I've EVER had. We chose the all meat selection (5 for $35) -- coppa, proscuitto di casella, lingua (OMG SO GOOD!! what a surprise!), duck proscuitto (my other fav), and speck. If you're adventurous I would definitely recommend both the lingua and duck proscuitto, both so unique and so tasty.- Bone marrow pizza: wow, this pizza is super unique. Didn't see too many chunks of bone marrow itself, but definitely a very flavorful umami-like flavored pizza. Would get this again.- Pig tail special: the night we went there was this pig tail special that was braised and SO good! I'd never had pig tail before and it was actually amazing! Who would've thought!- Spaghetti carbonara con riccio di mare - mmmmm sea urchin pasta. so rich and creamy, very heavy, but get it!- Tagliatelle con sugo - your typical bolognese, and of course, very good.- Zeppole dessert: cute ricotta donuts with nutella, great way to round up dinnerIf anything, come here to experience the most amazing charcuterie board ever.

Yum!",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"The food here was great! The arancini were great, crispy on the outside but soft and delicious on the inside! The ceasar salad was really good, it tasted fresh but was a little spicy and had chunks of ice cubes in it which was a little odd. The cavatelli with chicken sausage was probably some of the best pasta I have ever tasted anywhere in Boston and would highly recommend. We also got a pizza which was crispy, hot, cheesey, and delicious. It's a really small restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation, we made one a couple weeks in advance and still had to wait 15 minutes for our table.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"It is a small, hip restaurant for Italian tapas with some very unique dishes. I ordered the meatballs and one of the pizzas. The meatballs came in three and were spectacular. The beef was great and the tomato sauce was amazing. I had some mixed feelings about the pizza I ordered: bone marrow. I have eaten bone marrow before and loved it. As such, I was intrigued by it as a topping on a pizza. In addition, I saw online reviews that have raved about it. The taste and the smell were definitely different. It took me a slice to get used to the combination. I thought it was good but I am not sure I loved it. I would recommend a more conventional topping (e.g. pepperoni) if you do not want to be adventurous. In terms of the crust, it was very thin. It was like a crunchy flatbread. I prefer the crust thick enough to be chewy and doughy. Nonetheless, the dough and crust were good. The other food I saw other tables order, especially the pasta and charcuterie, looked great. I also ordered a blueberry soda. The drinks are from Maine. Blueberries from Maine are awesome and the sodas are great too.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary. You can also find the electronic copy through the link my profile.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"Honestly, wouldn't change a thing. We got here early, sat at the bar and had some great drinks. They had a carpaccio special which was delicious. It was great watching all the charcuterie being sliced right behind the bar. Then we had the arancini, which are a must try, especially with the sauce. Â Even though we were totally stuffed after the small plates, we couldn't leave without trying the grinder and tagliatalle.

Sitting out in the sun is great! Mussels are really fresh! The sauce of duck liver ravioli goes great with bread! The Wellington is really great! Just if the decorations could be better! Chicken was not bad but I wish I could have the scallops! However the risotto from the chicken was good.Ice cream and wine both made our dinner even better!,Marliave,"10 Bosworth St Boston, MA 02108"3,"Located in downtown Boston and very easy via Uber. Doesn't look like parking is friendly, but note downtown is never easy.Was initially attracted by the signature beef but ended up being a little disappointed. The overall atmosphere was more on the casual side, lights are not as dim as one would imagine in a 3$ French/Italian. With that being said, the interior could be improved as I feel it's a little less than par.The oysters and seafood ravioli was good, on par with other places in little Italy. The beef was what disappointed us a little. I see that the focus was more on the crusted outside than the meat itself, letting the quality and taste of the meat itself fall below par. I also find it uneasy as the crusted exterior constant fall apart from the meat itself though the crust itself tasted pretty good. Something to improve right there, especially when that's the signature. Â Service and price was on par with other place of similar prices.

I told a waiter and pointed out where he went in the corner, but he didn't believe me and said he didn't see anything (because the mouse ran). This was disconcerting.My friends ordered pasta dishes (Cacio & Pepe, the shrimp scampi, and the linguine) which looked and tasted like ramen dishes with a bland sauce. My one friend, a vegetarian, questioned what was in the sauce because it was brown in color, which implied it had beef stock in it. The first waitress said it didn't and it was just white wine, lemon, and garlic. The second wait staff then said it had brown sugar in it, which I've not heard of before. My one friend sent her dish back and ordered fish & chips (which were much better) and they didn't charge us for the switch, which was the right thing to do.I had the steak frites - the steak was undercooked and fries were mediocre at best.

Loved the ambiance and decor of this place, we sat on the second floor.

Fun time and great food and great company with friends!",Marliave,"10 Bosworth St Boston, MA 02108"3,"I came here on a Friday night with some girlfriends. With reservations, we were able to be seated immediately. The entrance is a little hard to find as there is one door near the main road that is well-advertised but is locked. You have to go around the corner and go up the stairs onto a patio, then through the doors. The inside is a very romantic, old-school setting. Here's what I got:Cocktails: The Flapper is the perfect drink if you like a cocktail on the sweet side, but not syrupy sweet.Sunday Gravy: overall ok. The gnocchi was a bit stiff and rather chewy but had good chunks of meat mixed in. The sauce was a blend of salty meat broth with tomato sauce, which was interesting. Truffle fries: I'm not a fries person but these were pretty good. You don't even need ketchup because they have such good flavor on their ownOysters: $1 from 9-10pm. Got a few, and they were ok.

I've been to Marliave twice, both for drinks and a snack while meeting friends. I went last night. Had a really good $9 savignon blanc and the chocolate cake ($10). Friends had cocktails and shared escargot, rarebit (one said it wasn't quite traditional rarebit), and caesar salad (definitely sharing size). I love the outdoor seating. The reason I docked a star or so is that the service was not good. We had to ask multiple times for a third water and for the dessert menu. It was also slow. And when they brought our check another person's credit card was in the folio. It was busier than I'd expect for a Tuesday night but still not acceptable.",Marliave,"10 Bosworth St Boston, MA 02108"5,"WOW! Best happy hour, dollar oysters I have ever had! The happy hour is from 4-6pm everyday and they usually offer a variety of oysters. We went two days in a row, and were able to find seating at the bar without having to wait. The restaurant can be a bit hard to find, but it is located up a small flight of stairs. The oysters here are so fresh, and both days, they had four options to choose from.

We came at 9:30pm and they had dollar oysters so we got that for the table DEFINITELY come for the oysters here. These dollar oysters are quality. They served our table 4 types of oysters in which I forgot all of their names but each of them are delicious and meaty. The scallops were to die for. The smooth and sweetness of the ravioli and sautÃ©ed mushrooms blended so well with the meaty scallops. Here and there I'd get bites the crunchy pumpkin seeds which enhances the textures. I thought the cheese plate and the desserts were also really tasty.",Marliave,"10 Bosworth St Boston, MA 02108"2,"Not entirely sure how to review this place. We came here twice during a long weekend in Boston due to its proximity to our hotel - the first time was a 4-star visit, the second a 1- or 2-star.First experience: arrived at ~5 for happy hour oysters. We happily slurped down a dozen (or two...), then ordered the beef wellington and brussels sprouts to share. Sat outside in the alley, which was a wind tunnel (menus and glasses flying), but enjoyable given the summer heat. Oysters were fresh, but I thought the other two dishes were pretty forgettable. Beef wellington especially tasted underseasoned and was underwhelming given the price.Second experience: arrived at ~9 for (what else?) late happy hour oysters. Sat at the bar inside given it was a freezing night. The bartender was a bit rude and hard to get ahold of. We ordered a first, then a second plate of oysters. Upon the arrival of the second plate, my boyfriend said that something smelled rotten. I had no idea what he was talking about until I picked up the offending oyster and caught a whiff. It smelled like something had died on the plate many days ago, and may have turned me off oysters for life. Bartender smelled it, seemed entirely unfazed (said ""it's probably a good idea to not eat that"") and charged us for the whole lot anyways. (Side note: we also got the Sunday gravy, which was good - largest gnocchi I've ever seen!)They say that people tend to remember the bad more than the good, and I guess that's true for me and Marliave. 2.5 stars, rounded down because I can still smell that death oyster.",Marliave,"10 Bosworth St Boston, MA 02108"5,"I go to Marliave about once a year.

Considering the quality of the food I ordered, I can conjecture that all of it would've been great.I had the parmesan truffle fries, because the smell of truffle oil in the air made me crave it. It was done just right but the portions were clearly for sharing. The blue cheese was pretty good and the candied walnuts + fig jam went so well with it. I wasn't fond of the lavender honey, I would've swapped it if I could.The escargot had a thick layer of cheese and I only ate what I needed.

I had the Mac and cheese, that was creamy but not too heavy, the beef Wellington that was perfectly cooked and a decadent chocolate cake for dessert.

So let me share it with you....My husband and I had such a nice dinner here the other night. Neither one of us wanted the evening to end. So we decided to split a dessert and ordered a couple of after-dinner drinks. We thought it was interesting that a restaurant like Marliave would offer tapioca pudding for dessert. I haven't had tapiocas in years. I think I might've had it in a hospital the last time, or could've been a diner in Maine. But tapioca pudding here? Isn't this fine dining? Well this must be a very special tapioca pudding. And indeed it was. I couldn't stop saying oh my gawd with each spoonful. They use the big, chewy balls instead of the usual tiny little pearls. The milk custard was insanely rich. It was truly a dessert you have to appreciate because in the back of your mind, you think ""it's just tapioca."" But it's not JUST a bowl of tapioca pudding. This was different. This was the Gold Medal of the Tapioca Olympics! As the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding.

Everyone on Yelp raved about it and of course I had to try it. I get French Onion Soup almost at every place I visit that offers it. So I couldn't miss this opportunity. I don't know, but that first taste just did not sit well. It had an aftertaste that I couldn't recognize. I don't know if the short ribs was giving off another taste. But I let my fiancÃ© try it and he too, said the same thing. I felt so bad returning it (first time!) because it was my fault for ordering it and not enjoying it. I really wished I did!

It's a $38 three course dinner serving you the same portion as their regular dinner menu (that's a steal). It's not exactly the full dinner menu but they have handful of their most amazing dishes. I got the Wellington (typically $38 on its own! This dine in Boston deal is like getting the Wellington with free starter and dessert). I loved it but it could've been perfect if the pastry was crisper. I liked how it was served in a cute little single portion. It didn't look much but it was filling and satisfying! My thoughts on the other menu items:Mac&Cheese - slightly disappointing. i couldn't taste the usual black truffle in itSliders - first time trying it and loved it!

I'd been here before but I'd gotten the raw bar which doesn't really showcase their food. Last night we shared the tuna crudo, two pork brick oven pizzas and the charcuterie board. Each dish was excellent. Their bread is amazing. Besides my favorite French restaurant in New England, Brewer's Fork also has the best bread I've tried in New England area. The charcuterie board was one of the best I've had. You know how some places fill up your board with a bunch of accompaniments, gherkins, honey comb, pickled veggies to make up for the puny and mediocre meat portions? Well not here! The entire focus of the board was the charcuterie. The portions were huge, six different meats. The pork rilletes was awesome. These guys are both chic and unpretentious.

My fiance and I visited on 3/20/2018 to grab a bite, a few brews, and celebrate another year of life. During our visit, Dan was our bartender/server and he was just a delight as well. Â Dan was very prompt, smiling, knowledgeable, and most of all...he didn't judge me for ordering 3 pizzas. We were preparing for a snow day the next day, after all. LOL. While the beers we drank escape me, the food was memorable for sure!Charcuterie Board: What a Gem! There was such a nice selection of things on this board, that it's probably going to be something I order every time. Â This came with Smoked Garlic Sausage, Lamb Terrine, Chicken Liver Mousse, Sopprasatta, Chorizo Seco, and Copa. The accompaniments were various pickled veggies. Carrot, green been, pickled onion, and some other little bits. Oh, and the bread? It's OUT OF THIS WORLD tasty! I believe on this night it was Sourdough from Iggy's, which I understand to be a local bread vendor. Tater Pizza, $17: Local potatoes, Creme fraiche, Maple Smoked Ham (VT), guyere (WI), Mozzarella, rosemary salt and an egg on top, in the center. Pair that with their fluffy, chewy, slightly crunchy crust and you have an amazing mouth full of flavor! I honestly feel like this could be a fancy adult breakfast pizza, just add mimosas to the mix! This will be ordered over and over for as long as it's on the menu! So delicious!Green Machine Pizza, $15: YES a green machine pizza, and it's much more enjoyable than it may sound at first glance. Â This beauty comes with Marinated Kale, Beet Greens, Pickled Beet Stems, Goat's Milk Feta (VT), Dill, and Arugula Pesto. It tasted even better than I'd originally thought, and the feta is just perfect! It's one of those things that you just have to try it before you knock it! Â It's actually light, and tasted a lot like maybe I've found a better way to get my greens in! Broccoli, Cheddar Bacon Pizza,$17: This is a simple, delicious, go to, and Â ran a close 2nd in the order of favorites on this visit. This pie cradles Vermont Cheddar, red onion, bacon jam, roasted broccoli, and Jack's Abbey Beer Mustard. This has so much flavor, and felt quite comforting from the cold outside that evening. I believe it was my honey's favorite of the evening. :) As a bonus, the pizzas from this place REHEAT VERY WELL!!! I reheated all of mine at 350 degrees for just about 10 minutes on a cookie sheet, and it was as if It was still fresh. Â Parts of the crust did get a little too crunchy for my liking, but were still edible and tasty. Â I like that the crust on the underneath re-crisped nicely and made the following day in quite tasty!BONUS: We were sent out a plate of complimentary cheese fries. Simple, cripsy, and as tasty as fries can get. Â I believe they were topped with provolone and green onion. Seasoned perfectly, and piping hot!!! I will be ordering those again to go along with the beer. DECOR: It's a very simple kind of place that feels modern, but I don't think industrial is the word I'm really looking for. I like that the kitchen is open, and you can see your food being made, as well as how open the floor plan is in general. Simple, yet interesting light fixtures, high and low top tables. It seems quite minimal on decor, and I liked it. VERY comfy/casual and good for kids as well as groups in my opinion.

These were goood!!!,The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"4,"I only tried their pizza and it was decent. You know those sliced you pick up and kinda flops over? Yea it's those. I guess I could've asked for the crust to be well done? But I didn't know it would be necessary. But the place is so cute! Nice outside area, big tables, good for large groups. The inside is nice and hip ambiance.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"5,"Coming back from a long drive and having built up an appetite, me and my lady were salivating for anything that had burrata on the menu. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of ingredients used at the Fork. Wolf Meadow Burrata was on point. Mushroom man pizza as well. Great beer selection to pair with food. Will be back next time in the area!",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"5,"This was the first spot we ate in Boston and what a great start to our trip! Thank you fellow yelpers because I really found this spot on a whim based on my group's cravings. The place feels like a neighborhood joint and we got seat for the 6 of us right away at the high top tables. We all wanted local drinks so we opted for beer and ciders. I have to say, I am a big fan of the downeast ciders after trying one here.After having some drinks, a good look at the menu led the group to debate on what to order. We finally settle on ordering a couple pizzas for all of us to share: the Freebird and the Bacon and Tater. Both pizzas were amazing and i don't think I have ever had toppings all grouped together like they have here. Very original flavor combinations. The Freebird had collard greens and as a Southern girl - the place has their collards done right! Love the smoky flavor all around! The Bacon and Tater was comfort food all the way. The creme fraiche really ties all the flavors together and helps the pizza not feel so heavy. The saddest part was that we only ordered enough so each person got one slice... I could have eaten some more of everything.Service was great. Our waiter really listened to us on what we wanted and gave us great recommendations for drinks. You also have to appreciate the industrial vibe of the place. I especially love that they used the cement blocks as a list for their beers on tap by making it a chalkboard with chalkboard paint.Overall, a great hidden find and it really felt like we were in on a great local's spot.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"5,"I am soooo mad.... that I don't live near by, as this would be one of my regular lunch places!! Â I had the grilled veggie pita and a Hefeweizen beer. Â The pita sandwich was by far the best version of that I have ever had!! Â It had a great selection for perfectly cooked veggies, and a chickpea salad on the side, and some pickles that included fresh ginger pickles - like the stuff with sushi, but big chunks and made in house. Â Kudos!!!!!! Â Btw. Â The pita was made in house!!! Â  Really great....My son had a great sausage pizza, but he's 16 and really grumpy and won't tell me anything else.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"5,"What a gem! Â The hip environment that is fun Â for all. Fresh food, open kitchen environment, excellent service and reasonably priced. Walking distance to Bunker Hill and the shipyard. Â The buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich was incredible. Good portion size with freshly baked biscuit. Terrific homemade pickled sides. Pulled pork sandwich was delicious with a fresh addition of pineapple instead of the usual B.B.Q sauce. The marge pizza was fresh and prepared to order. Good drinks and music too. I would come here again.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"4,"This place gets super busy on weekend nights so better make that reservation ahead of time! Oh wait! You can't- it's first come first serve. But that's fine, squirm your way over to the bar and grab one of the local beers from their extensive list. For dinner, the cheese board was amazing. I don't remember what the cheeses were (although they were all local!) but let's be honest, I'll eat anything that says ""cheese."" Speaking of which, the pizza. Wow. Delicious! We shared the tater pizza (had more of a breakfast-y taste) and the special which was a garlic bbq chicken pizza- the sauce was North Carolina style using a vinegar base. The pizzas are pretty small and personal size-ish. I found the price to be a little steep for the amount of food we got. But nevertheless the place is delish!",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"4,"What a wonderful find. Great beer with staff that know their stuff. Plus good music, most the beer is strong so buyer beware....",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"4,"My wife and I live down the street and we have been coming here for some time. Our jam is typically the Sunday brunch, but we've been able to make it for lunch and dinner on several occasions.The charcuterie board is great and their breads are sneaky good - I almost want to say some of the best bread in Boston but that seems like a big statement (might be true, though)! A wonderful selection of items on the board, and they gave awesome meat and cheese portions; definitely try the pork rilletes. Pizzas are out of this world and you really can't go wrong with any of them. The crusts are absolutely perfect (fluffy and chewy on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside and a nice flavor) with fresh ingredients. My favorite is the clam pizza, or anything with an egg on it - but they're all good.Awesome beer selection with plenty of local micro brews. Decor is unassuming and modern, with a natural/organic flair inside - I'd call it hipster chic, without the douchie-ness of the hipster part.No reservations is a bummer and you might wait a while for a table between 7-8:30, but it will be well worth the wait. Hostess Emily is a doll!",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"4,Good vibes all around here. Nice indoor and large patio seating! Industrial meets fun outdoorsy decor.Drink selection is good. They have a rose sangria! Really winey and refreshing for a hot summer day.We had the pizzas and cheese board. Both very delicious. The Spaniko-pizza was my favorite! You can order half and half pizza too which is good if you want to try more than one pizza.Great place to come if you're near the water in Charlestown for lunch or an afterwork drink.,The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"3,"This place is so hipster, so trendy, so cute, I loved the decor. There were a lot of children also, which seems to be the standard for any place that serves craft beer in a trendy millennial neighborhood, so this wasn't really a surprise. After reading reviews we decided to come on the earlier side which was a fantastic idea. We arrived right around 5:00 on a Saturday night and scored a free(!!!!) parking spot right in front, there was hardly anyone inside so we also got a comfortable table. They were completely packed about 45 min after we arrived. They have a very good beer selection and our server was really knowledgeable when it came to helping us select from their extensive menu. For food, we shared a cheese board which came with some great selections. I really appreciated that they had a chalkboard on the wall that listed what is included on the cheese board and charcuterie board (which changes regularly), rather than just saying ""chef's selections"" like you see in many other places. That helped us to decide not to waste the money on the charcuterie board when we saw things listed that we knew we didn't like. The pizza is what brought this review down to 3 stars from 4. My husband and I have very different ideas of what makes a good pizza and I appreciated that we were able to do half and half on one pizza rather than buying 2 whole pizzas. My half of the pizza was a pulled pork, kale, horseradish, and red onion that was one of the specials. I really wanted to like it but it was overwhelming with horseradish. I am one of those people that likes horseradish and all things tangy but this was incredibly overpowering. My husband's eyes were watering from across the table. It was also under the cheese and other toppings so it was very difficult to scrape it off the other slices. The other half of the pizza was the mushroom which was good but honestly I don't remember much about it because my mind is clouded by my poor pizza. I won't be rushing back but I am willing to give it another shot and try out a different pizza that hopefully is better than the one I tried this time.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"5,This was a unique restaurant with great beer and wine options as well as food choices. Small plates and a huge variety of off beat pizzas. Homemade top quality! Was our first night in Boston and will definitely stop back by and ohhhh no matter what you order add an order of meatballs. My sons said they're better than grandpa's but don't tell!!,The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"5,This is our go to place in Charlestown. They are known for their pizza and beer selection which are both great but my wife and I especially love their ceviche and crudo specials. We love how there is something new to try and everything is always creative and delicious. Awesome staff and really cool ambiance. The patio is great when it is nice out. Such a nice gem to have in Charlestown!,The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"5,Stopped here for mid day snack. Well it was more like a late lunch. The service was great! Place is modern and clean. They have a small outside patio.Pizza were all unique and delicious. They are open all afternoon so it's great if you need a snack mid day.,The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"3,Tried the sausage pizza. Couldn't really taste the fennel that was supposed to be on it. It was okay for a woodfire pizza.

Â Walking distance from the USA Constitution. Â Highly recommend.,The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"4,"This is a great choice for Italian in the Little Italy area of Boston! With so many great choices it can be difficult to narrow down where to go. If you choose this place, you won't be disappointed. The food was amazing compared to other Italian restaurants of similar stature. It is located right in the heart of the Italian district making it a great place to spend time. I tried the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, and as a consistent Italian food goer I can proudly say it was one of my favorites. When I came here I spent $576 but that was on 12 people so it averaged about $45 per person. With a large party, we reserved the top floor which made for a great view. The service was great as the waiters were very nice and quick to refill drinks. The food came out fairly quickly, though it took a while to get seated initially. None of the orders were messed up so the kitchen did a good job fulfilling the orders appropriately. Overall, it's a great choice that I recommend you trying.",La Famiglia Giorgios,"112 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"3,"My friend suggested this restaurant , so we checked it out. Its a nice homey kind of feeling. We ordered chicken parmigiana Â (which comes with penne or linguine pasta) and mozzarella sticks. Â The mozz sticks were yummy. the chicken Parmesan was huge, easily shareable between 3 people. The taste was a little bland but the quantity was very large.We were served fresh bread Â with an olive oil /Parmesan/chili flake mix before our meal which was delicious.",La Famiglia Giorgios,"112 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"We had the After Work special (wine, entree and mini dessert) for $20! Â Can you believe this price in Boston? Â They immediately served us with Italian Bread and Wine. Â The House Salad followed and were humorous and fully seasoned with iVinegar and Oil but adding Parmigiana Cheese made it so good that we couldn't believe it was not a complete meal and was part of a 3 course meal. Â The salad was followed by our Entree - Mussels with Garlic Sauce on Linguine and Chicken Parmigiana over Linguine with Marinara Sauce. Â We would have been so stuffed that we decided to share the Mussels (Left over seafood is not as good as left over meat) and just sample the Parmigiana and take 2/3 of it home and left room for the Mini Cannolis. Â After being satisfied we were pleasantly surprised that this meal was the least we spent on all Dinners and some Lunches we had in BostonWe had an epic dinner (albeit an early special) and was told they gave $8 Lunch SpecialsHighly recommend!!!!",La Famiglia Giorgios,"112 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Remember when you went to grandma's house when you were a kid and she served you some stuff that you didn't know what it was, but your mom told you to eat it, and so you did. Then over the years of eating it you started to like it and ate more of it. Then your grandma got that smile and piled a mountain of it on your plate and said eat eat eat! That's what this place is like. It's like eating at grandma's house where the recipe has been cooked the same way for generations, handed down on scraps of paper or for the really good stuff, never written down, just whispered in your ear. This place has it's following because you feel like you are at your Italian grandma's house and they stick to the basics of family home cooking. It's not haute cuisine or big bold flavors, it's old school Italian family cooking at it's best.I had the Veal Saltimbocca: veal, mushrooms, prosciutto, mozzarella, butter wine sage sauce $22.99 with fresh gnocchi $3. Veal is hard to come by on the West Coast because it is felt to be politically incorrect. Luckily, your Italian grandma on the North End Boston doesn't know who PETA is. ha ha, just kidding. It was quite good and as expected at grandma's house you get a mountain of it. I could barely finish half of it. I would order this again but get spaghetti instead on gnocchi. I am kind of fussy about gnocchi. I loved the veal, understated elegance and cooked to perfection. My chicken saltimbocca is work in progress, but grandma has it dialed in. If you want Italian home style family cooking with massive portion sizes, this is it. We came here for our anniversary with our daughter and her fiancÃ© and had a very memorable meal.

We were in the mood for pasta after following our noses on the Freedom Trail. Nice casual atmosphere.The menu was a bit overwhelming as everything looked and sounded so good. Luckily, our waitress gave us some recommendations. You get to pick your sauce and pasta. Trust me, order the homemade pasta...it's so worth the extra 3 bucks! I got the marina sauce with the fettuccine and added meatballs (the size of a house!). The sauce was fresh and bright and the meatballs were delicious.

That always means the food is BOMB. We waited about 30mins to be seated and w/ two staving kids, it wasn't easy. But so worth the wait.

Their donuts of the day were white chocolate mango () and bourbon chocolate crumble (). We tried the latter and it was amazing. We also had the sugar and spice donut holes which did not disappoint.The decor is super fun and chic in one room and super classy chic in the next. I love what they did with the old Church space!

Â We started at the bar with a few drinks and a plate of 12 oysters ($12 + $1 per sauce).For our meal, we ordered the following items to be split amongst six people (triple date!) Â They serve in small plates, so we ordered eight dishes: - Brussel Sprout Salad - $10 **- Sweet Potato Hasselback - $10- Calamari a la Plancha - $12- Roasted Cauliflower - $14- Tuna Poke - $16- Squash Stuffed Cappelletti - $16 **- Crispy Trout - $17- Grilled Hanger Steak - $22 **The best items: **Brussel Sprout Salad**, the **Cappelletti**, and the **Steak**. Â The Brussel Sprouts were roasted perfectly and drizzled in a delectable sauce. Â The Cappelletti was creamy and savory, and the Steak was juicy and soft. Â Things I wouldn't recommend: the Calamari, Cauliflower, and Poke. Â These were either imbalanced or pretty average dishes. Â But I'm also originally from Hawaii so I get picky about my poke lol. After our meal, we went back out to the front (""the expo kitchen"") where they have foosball and shuffleboard -- a fun end to our evening!

I believe that each room has its own menu as well. My friend and I opted for the front room where there is an open kitchen! I was ravenous when and small plates are always the way to go - you get to try a little of everything! We ordered:Chicken wings - these had sesame seeds and a really good crunch. Crispy Potatoes - these were definitely the most memorable. The aji amarillo aoli is so tasty. The potatoes were right out of the fryer - they were very hot and crunchy. Cheeseburger - my friend and I split this. It was a little larger than a slider and definitely a good choice. Soppressata - this was a weird mix of ingredients - potato, onion, horseradish leaf pesto. I think I would have liked it a little better if it was plain pesto. But there was a nice char on the pizza from the brick oven. I would love to come back soon and try out the menu in the club room!

We split a pizza and some drinks, which were fine, the dessert was not great though. It was some kind of banana/chocolate/hazelnut combo and I really don't recommend it, although it was plated nicely.Service was quick and friendly, and the thing I really liked about it was the board games available to play while you eat/drink.

Sinfully good.-Pancakes: I believe it was caramelized pineapple or something similar when I went, but it changes. It's a super thick pancake (it looks like one of those rice cooker pancakes except not quite as thick), soaked in syrup and butter. It is one of the most unique pancakes I've ever had, and it was fantastic.-Donuts: Oh, the donuts. These are the ones I dream about.

We all should have gotten the pancakes, which were great. The donut holes were dry and hard and tasted like they had been sitting out for a day or so. The huevos rancheros and shakshuka both came highly recommended but were incredibly salty and lacked any other flavor. We also waited almost an hour for our food - do not come hungry.. Our server was wonderful and the bloody mary was excellent.

The quinoa and pork bowl, the quoahog, the chicken dish (WOW) and pork/shrimp wontons were all really, really good. Probably only knocking a star off because it's definitely a tad pricey for the small plates. Not crazy, but a little expensive. Love how quiet that part of The Fenway is...will be back for sure",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"1,"I have never been to this place and will make sure I never step foot in this place as long as current owner/manager remains. All it takes is one scenario to play out in which the customer is dissatisfied to loose other potential customers. That is why its so important to be professional as an owner, but apparently not this one! My husband's cousin who is one of the sweetest person I know was at this establishment to celebrate her sister's boyfriend's birthday and when she ordered a drink was asked for an ID. She presented her ID and was told it was fake. (she is close to being 30!) She asked to speak to the manager and she was rude to the point of even using profanity. All I know is that at the end of the story the cops came to prove this was a legitimate ID and a report was filed. This story made me pretty upset and that is why I am sharing this here. I hope the owner/manager learns her lesson that customers should be treated better. The word is out this place is not so nice and I also hear that their pizza is always burnt.",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"5,"Went before a concert at Fenway. Sat at the bar and had phenomenal service. Bartender was friendly, helpful, and never left our glasses empty! Ordered nachos and a pizza and it was delicious. The atmosphere of Tapestry made us feel incredibly welcome and comfortable. It was our first time here and we will definitely come back.",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"1,"I came here for a friend's surprise birthday party. A bartender told me my ID was fake and asked if I had something else with my name on it, so I provided a school ID, multiple credit cards, health insurance card, checkbook, etc. He said he still couldn't serve me drinks. I asked to speak to a manager and was directed to a woman sitting at the bar. She was annoyed that I was interrupting her evening with friends, but how is that my fault when your staff directed me to you? I calmly explained the situation, and she was dismissive and kept talking about how she's not working. A few of my friends who had experienced the same treatment at the bar came around and multiple people were talking at once, but the situation escalated when she jumped up from chair, got in my face, and yelled ""OK BITCH! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!"" How professional. It took everything I had not to react physically (read: slap the shit out of her) with her finger pointed in my face so aggressively. Needless to say, I would not recommend this place. The hostess was very nice and apologized to us on our way out.",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"4,"May be the only restaurant that accepted a last moment reservation for after a red Sox game. We were worried because we had guests from Japan. Swift game and we were seated in the Club Room right away. Though service started out slowly, but caught on eventually. Deviled eggs, green curry escargot, bigoli pasta, crispy trout, gnocchi ...Then we found out that the club room does not serve any of the pizzas due to the kitchen space constraints.

I love a good char on a pizza, but this one was just straight up overcooked and the bottom of the pizza was all black. i think the actual toppings and sauce and cheese were good, but the handling of pizza was just amateur. an amateur move on my part, ordering the calamari thinking it would be fried. don't make the same mistake as me haha! don't think i'll be back again since i mainly came for the pizza and outside of that nothing else on the menu seemed interesting enough to order.",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"1,Not a pleasant impression to be had after experiencing management's Â unprofessional and outright offensive behavior toward guests.,Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"2,"**BRUNCH REVIEW**I was really excited to try this place out for brunch because of all the good reviews and I was so disappointed...They have a really nice interior, with a small outside patio. There's board games and shuffleboard and other fun things. Went for Sunday brunch and there didn't seem like there was many people but service was still so slow. Took forever for my friends to get their drinks. They give you bottles of water for the table. Our waitress took our empty bottle and never came back with it filled. And whenever the waitress came by, she barely looks at us so it was difficult to get her attention.I had high hopes for the food. But after seeing my food when it arrived, I was so disappointed, especially since everything on the menu isn't cheap and over $10. I came here really wanting to try their Smoked Salmon Pizza that I saw on their online menu. But They didn't even have it on their menu today.**FOOD**RED QUINOA - this sounded good on the menu. Said it was gunna have quinoa, avocados, scrambled eggs and some veggies. I was imagining a small breakfast bowl with some toast. My small, sad little plate came out with a big green gloop with some quinoa mixed in. The veggies were on the side with 2 unripe slices of avocado. I was literally so confused when I saw my plate. Where are the scrambled eggs? I guess it was mixed into the green mush which is supposed to have walnut pesto. The mush did not taste like eggs or pesto. It was SO bland. Might as well have eaten straight up plain quinoa. The charred broccoli was good and that was about it. And there was no toast to go with this. $14 LOLGREEN SHAKSHUKA- my friend go this and I didn't get a chance to try it. I've had Shakshuka before and it's delicious. This was green Shakshuka and I have no idea what that is but it looked just as sad as my red Quinoa plate. It did not come in a griddle they usually do. It was a small plate with an attractive blob of what looked like scrambled eggs with mixed in. At least this dish came with toast.SHISHITO PIZZA- this was actual pretty good. Mostly because you can't mess up pizza. They do have an actual pizza oven in the kitchen. Â Shishito is apparently some kind of green pepper. Had shishito, potato slices and prosciutto. POTATOS (side) - probably my favorite thing we ordered. Literally just a side of potato's with some aoili sauce. It's small round potato's but they make it really crispy on the outside. Â Maybe their other stuff is good. But if you try this place out, ask the waitress what everything is before you order anything. Don't assume things like I did because it was definitely NOT worth paying what we paid for the food we got.",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"4,"Closer to a 3.5 star, but rounding up cuz I'm feeling generous. The corned beef hash breakfast toast didn't disappoint, but the small portions left a bit to be desired especially for the price. The pancakes and other sweet items looked more substantial. My iced coffee was also served in a plastic water cup striking me as a bit odd. Fantastic location and good service. Would probably come again.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"3,"Boston was a one night stop for our family trip, unfortunately. Â BUT....we all hate seafood.  I know, why come to Boston?!? Â Um, History, Family, and to hopefully find other great eats. We came here for dinner after seeing they had a food option for vegetarians. First of, it was confusing. Â There was a sign that says ""Order Here"". When we went to that sign, the waitress seemed frustrated with us. Â So she rushed us to a table and walked away. Â From that point forward she just seemed mad at us. Â I get people have horribly hard days in the food service industry. Â I made sure we all had our orders ready when she came back. We ordered and waited for more water. Â It was so damn hot out. Â Like 89 without the heat index, and we were walking that ALL DAY. Â We ordered more than just water, but seriously, we were going through it so fast, just bring a pitcher or carafe. Â The place wasn't full by any means. Â  Â I had the steak frites, which was delicious. Â I would have licked the plate if my spouse didn't give me the ""don't do it eyes"". Â Kids chicken tenders were ""fine"", they said. Â Friend had a burger that was ""ok"". Â We also had a salad that was rated as ""fine"". Â So, I guess if you are going, get the steak frites. And maybe go with a group of people who aren't exhausted from walking the Freedom Trail all day.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"1,"The entire trip, Sonya and I pysched ourselves up for nutella waffles. Having heard the lines can be quite long on the weekends, we opted to visit around 8:30 on a Monday morning.We were greeted and told to wait in line to order. You cannot save a table - you have to order first, then they will seat you. We thought for sure we'd be stuck without a table because of the amount of people ahead of us, but apparently the turnover is fast enough that it wasn't a problem. The line was still a bit long and wrapped around the really tight area, thus blocking the two bathrooms. We watched them cook as we waited, and I'll say they work rather quickly. We were about 10th in line, but still waited about 15 minutes before being able to order.Because we apparently share a brain, Sonya and I placed identical orders for the nutella waffles with strawberries, but no bananas. But once our food arrived, the excitement gave way to disappointment. The strawberries had clearly been frozen (they hadn't entirely thawed), and the nutella looked just like Hershey's syrup... it was quite thin and barely tasted like nutella. Though we didn't want to mix nutella with syrup, the waffles were just too dry so we used the syrup on the table. The waffles themselves were bland and a bit dense, not the fluffy kind I was hoping for.This was mediocre food... and we waited in a line for it. Sonya put it perfectly at the end of our meal: ""I want a re-do of our breakfast.""",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"The Paramount is pretty much as good as it gets. Â They have a great policy of ordering first then finding a table and I can tell it worked because we didn't have to wait at all.

Food: Brioche French toast 5/5Fruit salad- 4/5Corned Beef Hash- 3/5 Avocado Toast with Ham- 4/5I was a bit disappointed at the corned beef hash because it was a bland, I ended up using a ton of hot sauce on it. Â The best part was definitely the french toast, the second you order these puppies the chef takes the bread and dips them in the egg batter to get started. Â It was awesome!The service was great, they ushered people in and cleaned up tables as fast as possible to make sure everyone gets a seat. Â Definitely a hot tourist spot, but worth it to make the trip.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Our trip to Boston started with the Paramount. The first place we stopped and visited when we got here. Walked almost a mile from our hotel to get here. The line was out the door. Some of the seating in here is intertwined with the line to order your food. Â The line goes all the back into the restaurant and wraps itself in itself. Literally. Â How these guys keep everything in order? No clue. The chefs taking orders never stop. Order after order after order. And somehow, they keep it all together. Very impressive. The staff is nice. Although the entire operation is a mess, they keep their cool and get things done the right way. Everything is priced fair. Â If something has their ""smoked feta"" then I recommend you order it. Knowing what I know now, would I wait that long again for this place? Probably not. Â The wait can get long. Our line was right up to the front door and we waited almost 25 min to order. I'd come back if the wait wasn't too long.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,I love love love this place! Some coworkers suggested we come here but I've never heard of it before. Their gluten free waffle was amazing! The price gets a little pricey with toppings which is understandable considering how much they loaded my waffle with strawberries. GF Waffle with no strawberries wouldn't been $8. They are set up a little different then most restaurants. You walk in to place your order and pay then you set down. By the time you set down and get yourself situated your food is being bought to you. Very effective process. Will be back soon!,The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Waited about 45 minutes on a Sunday to get in for brunch, so not too bad. I tried:+ sweet potato fries+ fruit salad+ huevos rancheros+ side of turkey bacon+ avocado sunriseEverything was delicious and the prices are reasonable. Definitely worth the wait!",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"2,"Got here with my party of 4 around 10:30am on a Saturday.I always wondered what it would be like to eat on a submarine with 300 grumpy and hung over sailors. Now I know.This place was super-cramped, hot and uncomfortable. Also, it was a bit pricey for just a cramped diner experience. Could not wait to escape this place.Food quality was very basic. Recommend that you skip this.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,Found this worth the wait for breakfast. Get there early as possible. Their seating process works well but it's a teeny tiny space. Boston cream pancakes and caramel French toast were both delicious and EVERYTHING looked great.,The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Overall: Great food with decent prices, Paramount is a go-to diner experience!The good: The place has a charm and charisma with the rush and amount of people all packed into one tiny place.Typical diner fashion with the cooks right there in front of you when you order. Â The menu is large and well-varied between savory or sweet options. More importantly, though, the food was great. Hot, well-portioned, and a great combination of flavors.The not-so-good: The line can get incredibly long, it probably took us 20 minutes to order, and when we left it was even longer. The restaurant is cozy, but that means when it's crowded there's not a lot of room to navigate.That also means that it's loud with all the people and chaos.Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 8/10Food: 8/10",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"3,"As a person who loves dining at places with a bit of history, it was a no brainer for me to try this 85 year old breakfast joint. This place was a hot topic on Boston food blogs and came recommended by several of the Uber drivers I met. I ordered the Boston Cream Pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs and sausage. The pancakes tasted exactly as it sounds like a Boston Cream Pie! I thought it tasted great! The eggs were simple and the sausage was decent. The portion size was huge. My fiancÃ© ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs. The corned beef hash although was a large size portion it was not the greatest tasting. If you are a corned beef hash enthusiast you will likely not like it. The place was fairly expensive for a breakfast stop. Without even ordering drinks the above meal costed $46. The ambiance was very crowded. Although it does have a nice flow allowing you to find a spot to eat, you will likely be rubbing elbows with customers waiting in line while you are eating your breakfast. The customer service was fair and so was the cleanliness. In my opinion, this is a place you try once for the experience.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Brendan and Becca:Made a quick pitstop into The Paramount on Charles St. in late morning. Upon entering, you are immediately struck by small town diner charm. They have an interesting: order first, pick up your food, and then get ushered to a seat by a host/hostess system - kind of bewildering at first if you don't know the gig, but in sitting there for just 10 minutes you learn that they've got it down to a science and keep the restaurant pretty high throughput. We both chose lunch sandwiches, but it was a close call because the breakfast options they were still offering were pretty enticing. I had a Mediterranean inspired chicken and mozz with pesto sandwich. It was a well-portioned, well-executed sandwich. Wouldn't change a thing about it. She had a chicken salad wrap with french fries. Also well-executed and very enjoyable. Definitely will be back to try more of their delicious looking breakfast options. Would definitely recommend to a friend.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"My husband chose this location for breakfast before our walk to the public garden. Upon entering, I noticed the long line and I saw only booth. So I was about to walk to go save it, but at the same time we were politely told to wait in line to order/pay and then be seated. So we gave it a go. The line was a double line and very cramped but once you get to the counter you watch them cook your food in front of you. We waited for a minute or 2 and we were surpisngly seated. The system works. It seemed to push some people away, but give it a go! You will be surprised. We ordered the caramel & bananas french toast and cinnamon french toast with nutella, strawberries and bananas. The sizes are HUGE and they are DELICIOUS! The line goes by at a decent pace so don't let it scare you away as I almost was. This was at about 9AM on a Sunday. We would LOVE to return!",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Definitely not what you expect when you think of brunch with this unorthodox seating arrangement, but let me tell you this place is worth the experience. You are immediately ungulfed with the smells of breakfast as you enter and make your way to the 'order here' sign, and it only gets stronger as you approach the kitchen. Best part about it all is the interaction you get with the chef as you yell out your order from the middle of a hangry mob. Then as the procession of the single file line continues down the window between you and the food, you feel the heat of grill as your eggs are cracked into it's surface; you taste the hit of paprika in the air as the homes fries are dressed; and you melt as the butter is spread on the bread. Not soon enough to plow through the plate of food you are seated and everything is right with the world again as you enjoy breakfast and coffee.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"A diner-feel small spot, quick service, many options of brunch foods (eggs, omelets, toasts, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches, burgers). Everyone will have something they will enjoy here, and it will not disappoint. The breakfast special wasn't anything particularly special, but I will be coming back for the omelets and waffles!",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"3,"I'm a fan of the food, for sure. My husband and I came on a lovely spring Saturday early afternoon and the first thing we noticed was the long line. Well, if THAT many people like it, it must be good right? We decided to take a chance. We didn't realize their seating policy until we got inside. The seating policy is that you don't sit until you get your food, and when you are ready to sit there will most likely be a table open. So basically you are waiting in line for a long time (for us it was, no joke, close to 40 minutes) and then not 100% guaranteed a seat, though for the most part we realized there was always a table open when needed. Seems risky tho! While you are waiting in line, you're trying not to bump the people eating and constantly needing to squeeze out of the way of the servers. The staff clearly has a system down that seemed to be efficient, but I think on any day less than a Saturday early afternoon it would have been much less chaotic and cramped and the whole experience a little more enjoyable.The good part is the good is VERY yummy. I had the avocado sunrise open-faced toast and my husband had the chorizo omelette. Both tasted great and were flavorful and colorful. We felt like we had to eat quickly, though, because we knew there were so many more people waiting to get a seat. We didn't talk much when we ate. We had done most of our talking in line and were too hungry to talk when we sat down to eat! Â Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here, at least not on a weekend. But I would recommend trying this place if you're in the area on a weekday morning or early afternoon because the food really is good.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Amazing. Simply amazing. Been coming here for years and the huevos rancheros never disappoint. The tortillas are hot, the eggs are perfectly fried, and the mix of beans and potatoes and avocado mix perfectly. The line is long as you know, but I really love their unique way of getting everyone a table as soon as they have their food. It really works!Other than that, we split a burrata-tomato-avocado fried egg meal, which was heavenly. The burrata portion was huge, something you'd easily pay $15 for at a nice restaurant. It paired really well with the eggs and tomatoes. Must try! Especially with a nice mimosa to start the brunch off properly. Pros:ServiceHuevos rancherosFoodMimosas - strong pour for only $5Atmosphere - no frills, just foodCons:Long line can lead to a long wait. Pro tip: go get coffee from a nearby store before you get in line (or after haha) and enjoy it as you wait.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Pretty cool, the main chef is REALLY good and fast. It's really intriguing watching him prep all the meals and he cooks them right in front of you. Once the food is ready and you pay for it, they open up a seat for you! The only issue is that the wait is really long on the weekend but that isn't the restaurants fault. The restaurant is also VERY tight, I mean it's so small that when it's busy you can't even stand in the line without touching each other which is kind of off putting but otherwise a great place!",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Yum. Loved this place in Boston. Really neat to see local people love this place, too.Enjoyed a bountiful breakfast on Fourth of July morning. Â The line was worth the wait and it went quickly due to the efficiency and coordination of Paramount's employees.We will return.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"I saw a yummy picture of french toast so that is all that I wanted to eat and that is all I am basing any judgment for this place off of.I went with multiple people who asked me easily... 7 times. ""What should I get"" my response each time, french toast. Guess what they ended up getting not french toast! Sorry, just had to vent really quick.French Toast was very good borderline great. I would go back to this place for french toast. Crispy exterior and a cushiony soft interior. Great flavor, only optimized with the caramel sauce and bananas. This would so much be the best breakfast dessert. Which it was. I highly recommend trying this.Potatoes were pretty terrible. Fresh, but not cooked well and they are huge without anything to make them special. Just salt and peppa.THE VERDICT:Going with a 4 for this place because I loved the french toast and I normally am not a big sweet french toast guy. Everything else I can't vouch for because I am a decent humanbeing with a conscience unfortunately.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Great food and drinks at Ward 8. Came in after a Yelp reviewer mentioned it was near the city winery and since we were in the area how could I not try a new place. The duck drumsticks with sweet and spicy chili sauce were delicious and the French fries with bacon and cheese even more sinfully delicious. We shared the above but I ended my meal with the kale salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing that I substituted for the listed dressing. It was great. My friend ordered a different salad and I took one look and ordered mine instead, happy I did. The drinks were good, my friend ordered cocktails and I sipped wine and then ginger ale with bitters after the french fries hit home but for the Love of all things fried I'd do it again. Great place, the front is the bar area with a few scattered tables but the back is actually quite enticing with romantic mood lighting. It's also a great date night location without the quiet and/or expensive intimacy. After all it is a gastropub!!Go enjoy, bring your tums if your not used to unhealthy kind of delicious food. There are dinners to order that are healthy and good for you food. I'd return for dinner. The salmon and chicken dishes looked good. I'd return if in the area again.

Best cocktail bar, amazing food & overall good vibes!",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"1,"There was a concert the night we visited and there were way too many people at the bar trying to get a drink before the concert. At my dining table, we had to shout just to barely hear each other it was so loud and overwhelming. Ward 8 should cap how many people they accept into their bar area. Additionally, when we went to use the bathroom, it was utterly disgusting. There was wetness all over the floor, a straw and lime in the sink, and a COCKTAIL GLASS in the toilet. We had a $200+ meal and that bathroom was worse than a porta-potty. But that is not even the worst part.About 3:30 AM after my dinner at Ward 8, I woke up to the worst food poisoning I have ever experienced. It was violent and lasted for 24 hours. I was throwing up, had major chills, a terrible headache, and a high fever. I called to let them know what had happened. The floor manager was very kind and apologetic and told me that she would talk to her GM to ensure they would compensate me for the issue. It has been 24 hours and I have still not received a call back.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"3,"Food and space was great, but wow, the staff was really trying hard to discourage us from spending our money there. We walked in and all the tables were empty, but the server that greeted us wouldn't let us sit at a table for drinks, but insisted we go to the bar. Even though it was 2:30PM and the place was totally empty. Then when we got a server, then wouldn't let us order for the bar, even though we were hoping to lighten her workload by ordering from the bar. Because the staff didn't seem to want us at a table because they didn't want to serve us just drinks. Finally she kept asking us repeatedly if we wanted more drinks, even though our glasses were still fairly full. We did end up order appetizers which were delicious, but the staff experience was subpar and I'd probably not come back.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"3,"This is an interesting restaurant, very modern and quaint. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly. I did not care for the odd, not so clean bathrooms with spray painted wells.For a meal I ordered the seared tuna sandwich.

Ward 8 was ok but I'm in no rush to return.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"5,"I have heard so many good things about Ward 8 and finally got to go there for lunch. The restaurant style reminded me of North End Oyster (come to find out they are owned by the same company). The bar is nice and centrally located in the restaurant. Our server, Eric, was very attentive and friendly. Our food came out very quickly and the sandwiches were great! We would definitely come back here for dinner and try some of their famously known cocktails!",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"3,"I really wanted to love this place based on the mix of cuisines they offered, plus oysters and cool drink names, but it was just okay. Food:There just wasn't anything special about the food. The fries were pretty good but the oysters didn't taste very fresh. The duck wings were just okay. And the lobster roll, although surprisingly inexpensive, was fairly meh as well (nice touch is you can get one roll warm and the other cold if you want, although I tried one of each and was left unimpressed, especially with the warm one). My fiancÃ© got the ribeye and it was almost half fat, which was quite disappointing. Drinks:The names were very interesting and they sounded delicious. Unfortunately my drink was just okay (although it looked really neat!) but my fiancÃ©'s drink was very refreshing and delicious.Service:The service was probably the best part of the night. Our server was very attentive to details (especially for my fiancÃ©'s allergies). Decor:The place looked cool from the few pictures on yelp but inside it just looked like it was arranged very poorly with the tall, giant bar in the middle and then clusters of small tables on three sides of the room. You'll know what I mean if you check it out. Impression: I feel like it looks like a place I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar and grabbing the right drink and the right food; I just don't know what to really recommend, but it's probably one of the less expensive places in the area. I may gave it a shot again.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"5,Great brunch spots!

They also have great big salads,Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"4,They didn't have steak the day I went unfortunately. I got the half chicken instead and it was good. The tuna sandwich was a bit bland though. The servers were friendly but I found the service to be better than the food.,Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Overall: Solid drinks and attention to detail help Ward 8 stand out among other bars in the area.The good: A good bartender makes a huge difference no matter where you go, and we were lucky to be paired with one who asked for our taste preferences to recommend drinks. Then he crafted our choices and delivered some quality drinks (in my case, the Black Widow). And, they were effective, no skimping here. The presentation is also well done, from the glassware to the bar area and lighting.The not-so-good: By the time we were wrapping up, the atmosphere had changed quite a bit and was suddenly loud and busy, which was quite different from the low-key vibe when we entered. It was starting to get shoulder to shoulder. The music also changed to match that new vibe.Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 10/10Drinks: 9/10",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"4,"I really like this place. I used to work near North Station and would sometimes go to Ward 8 for a nice lunch. What prompted a review now is that I went last weekend with a friend before the Janet Jackson concert at the Garden.It was a Sunday night and it was super busy at 7 PM. I'm glad I made a reservation! I'm thinking it was that busy because of the concert. Everyone pretty much cleared out at the same time. Kudos to them for playing Janet Jackson music all night. Ha!Downsides first because they are small - it can get very loud in there. With the number of people and the music, my friend and I were yelling at each other across our small table. It's also a little cramped in there and some weaving & waiting had to be done to get to and from the bathroom in the back. Lastly, it took a while to get the check. All pretty small things, which is why this place still gets 4 stars from me.The food is delish. I've never had a bad meal here. Last week specifically, I got the cobb salad with chicken. Now, I'm not a big salad fan. Or veggie fan. Or fan of healthy anything. Lol. Hence, the cobb salad versus one without bacon. BUT, it still made me feel good about myself to get something with green in it. Let me tell you that the salad was BOMB! I've had cobbs other places. This one was delicious. The chicken was plentiful, juicy and tender. The bacon and egg mixed in brought it all together. The amount of dressing was perfect - not too little, not too much. I would actually go back there just to get another salad (how weird!) :-)For a drink, I got the bees knees. I've also had this cocktail elsewhere, but somehow, the Ward 8 version was elevated. It was sweeter than other ones I've had. I had to hold myself back from ordering another one.All in all - this is a really good restaurant with tasty food and drink options and fresh ingredients. I'll keep coming back as long as they keep up the good work. Remember that reservation if there's an event at the Garden!",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"3,"I really wanted to love this place but just couldn't. My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday dinner which slowly turned into ""gets get drinks and Â an appetizer instead.""We ordered the five layer dip and chips to start the evening. I can't have any dairy and asked beforehand if there was any dairy in the dip because it looked dairy free on the menu. The waitress said that there was sour cream in the guacamole and additional sour cream in the dip, both which I asked her to omit. She wrote down that I had a dairy allergy on her server notepad which I appreciated and about 15 minutes later we got the appetizer. It straight up looked like it was swimming in sour cream. After trying a bite, I confirmed that it was, in fact, sour cream and my boyfriend was kind enough to scoop all the sour cream out of the way so I could meagerly munch on the remaining dips on the bottom of the dish. It honestly took about another 15 minutes for the waitress to come and tell us that- oops, there is sour cream in the onion dip!For someone to note a food allergy and not follow through with the kitchen about it was very perplexing and disappointing as a person with dietary restrictions. The dip also wasn't anything special to write home about. If you have any dietary issues or would like raveworthy food in the North End, I would look elsewhere.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"3,Came here for some cocktails after dinner. The place was pretty crowded but we were lucky to find two seats at the bar. The bar tender was really nice and friendly but he was so swamped he was't able to even take our order for about 15min after we got seated. Once he finally got done with all the orders we got our orders in and our drinks within minutes. Drinks were great and really strong which I enjoyed. Atmosphere is loud and dark but great place to catch up over drinks.,Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"1,"Pathetic. Asked for 3 old fashioneds for my party of 4 and got a snotty reply saying ""what kind? The $30 kind?"" Aside from the insinuation that I couldn't afford a good drink, the bartender described herself as a ""b*tch after 11,"" and walked away. Shortly thereafter, I indicated to another bartender that I had been unable to obtain decent service from his colleague and asked again for 3 old fashioneds, immediately specifying the whiskey type this time. He refused to serve a member of my party who has a mental illness (but who is harmless, completely sober, and wasn't even going to be drinking alcohol), despite saying the member of my party seemed ""polite"" and despite me clearly ordering 3 drinks for a party of 4. We started to walk out and I noticed they had an air of humor about my party. I strongly expressed disappointment about how we were offended and left. I suspect they dislike customers who come by after the Garden, as they were quick to ask if we had been to a show. Kind of like the people who move next to a farm and complain about the smell. Except worse. Did I miss the memo? Is this place a cocktail bar affiliate of Dick's Last Resort? If so, you need a new business model. If not, you need new bartenders. We went to a competing bar and spent $250 where we received no additional insults from unctuous hipsters.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"4,"One of the better food options around north station. I Â normally come here for lunch. I would recommend their duck wings and roast beef sandwiches. But to avoid food coma, salads are my go to. They are normally chopped up and well seasoned. Avocado salad might look very underwhelming but mixed herbs added layers of flavor, carrots and sesame seeds give it an additional crunch. It's quite filling without adding protein.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"2,"Restaurant was trendy, the atmosphere was good. No ac...on a hot summer day couldn't even stand to be in the restaurant. Food looked good on yelp...",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"3,"If you check out my last review for this spot you might notice that it previously had a higher rating. This isn't necessarily because it's gone down in quality, but simply because this time around I was able to judge the spot more accurately. My boyfriend and I came to the restaurant in the winter (two whole years after our first visit) and were quickly seated at a table. We came around 7pm and the place was pretty busy, in fact, the entire back section was taken up by a single party. Luckily we'd made a reservation and were quickly sat at a table near the bar.We started the evening off with a few cocktails, I can't remember which ones currently, but I do remember them being pretty to look at and nice to drink (albeit a touch on the expensive side). We asked our waitress what was good and she was unable to give us a proper recommendation, sorta shrugging and saying it was all ""good"".We wound up ordering the BLT pork buns, fried cheesesteak dumplings, maple chilli duck wings and the five layer dip. The food took an excruciatingly long time to get to us, over thirty minutes, and some items were lukewarm by the time they arrived. While the food was quite good (even at lukewarm temperature) I thought it was definitely overpriced. The pork buns are like 9 bucks and honestly aren't that different from normal pork buns! Because we ordered numerous items and our table was so small we did our best to finish our dishes quickly (which isn't too difficult considering the tiny portions) but our waitress would regularly pass by us without clearing the table, despite it being quite obvious that the space was too little to hold all our orders comfortably.One reason why I'm giving this place an average rating is that since my initial visit the vibes seem to have changed, becoming a bit more divey than I'd like (although that could have just been the clientele for that evening). The subpar service is the other reason.I wouldn't say you should avoid this spot entirely, it does have some positives (interesting drinks and pretty good food), but the price seems a bit much for what you're getting. I'd maybe consider getting brunch here another time, but for now I think I'll pass on dining here again (I will still order the duck wings though).",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"4,"I really liked this place. Came here for brunch one Saturday morning and was able to be seated immediately. Cool digs (we sat near a giant floor-to-cieling window which they graciously had open for us to enjoy), and ""hip"" atmosphere was modern but not overbearing. The food was also really on point. I had a modified version of the English muffin sandwich, which was yummy af (although, since I'm not a huge sausage fan [lol, pause] I asked for bacon on it instead which I wish they would have at least folded for me given that the straight unbent pieces made the whole thing incredibly unwieldy). And lastly, the cocktails were right as rain.Go here.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"4,"I popped by Ward 8 during lunch with a colleague. The restaurant was empty when we arrived at 12. Throughout lunch, there were a few other patrons, it seems this is more a dinner spot. The service was quick, I placed an order on sweet chili duck wings ($12) and ginger miso salmon ($24). It was my first time seeing duck wings on any menu - surprisingly it was delicious! Tender, juicy, and the sauce was just sweet & spicy enough without going overboard. The ginger miso salmon was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous, accompanied by healthy quinoa pilaf with strawberry bits.I'll be sure to check out the night scene and dinner food in the foreseeable future!",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Went to brunch with friends . As for the food , it wasn't anything spectacular , my biggest disappointment was that both of the eggs Benedict that were Â served to Â the table were overcooked ( the poached eggs ) Â the beverages were delightful and a good price point , great atmosphere a great place for brunch with friends but again yes the food is basic Â . Service wasn't bad , the waitress just seemed over whelmed Â and "" I don't want to be here "" . It's a fine line of I feel bad bc I've been swamped and want to have sympathy , then there is where you almost feel bad asking for anything bc you feel like you are asking too much . It shouldn't be that way , especially when I'm going to a place for ambiance and atmosphere to sit and drink with friends . The management should have the place properly staffed and if it is then the people working should not show their misery for working on a Sunday .There's places I frequent where I don't care for the food , but I like sitting and catching up with friends . If I went again just for drinks and the service was the same , I wouldn't return",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Joint boba and snack cafes are on the rise but only Cheers Cut x Gong Cha is the real deal. Just when you thought nothing can top Gong Cha opening down the street, they tack on an amazing Taiwanese snack/fast casual chain. And they learned from the other boba chains to up their quality of service. Â There's plenty of seating but don't expect to find many open spots on weekend evenings. From Cheers cut I recommend trying the basic ""ninja chicken nuggets"" which is popcorn chicken in the true Taiwanese fashion. Pick salt and pepper flavor & Taiwanese teriyaki sauce (given on the side) for taste test of the original classic style. Also would suggest a Taiwanese favorite, minced beef rice - decently cheap for a large bowl. I will be back soon to try more food offerings. And will definitely gather some folks to order the whole fried squid one day.",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"Cheers Cut. I've wondered many times what the meaning of the name is. After countless sleepless nights and hours of vein popping focus, I've decided to give up. Yep, just like that. How does the newest fried chicken restaurant in town compare to the already crowded fried chicken competition? Restaurant Type: Fast Casual/Takeout. Â My short summary: Cheers Cut is what happens when KFC meets Jay Chou. Food (65%)  Taste to price 5/5 Quality to price 4/5 Portion to price 4.5/5 Average = 4.5Service (20%) Â  Friendliness 3.5/5 Promptness 3.5/5 Average = 3.5Cleanliness (15%)  Bathroom 3/5 Dining area 4/5 Kitchen area 4/5 Average = 3.67Overall Score = [F(.65)]+[S(.20)]+C(.15)] Â  Â = [2.93]+[0.7]+[0.55]  Â  Â = 4.18What else to know: To be fair, Cheers Cut is from Taiwan and all the other fried chicken restaurants (namely Bon Chon, BBQ Chicken, K-Town) are Korean so in a way, competition is slightly different. Right from the start when you walk in, it's a different feel as this place is more of a takeout/fast casual restaurant. You'll see the majority of customers holding a Gong Cha cup (which is for a whole 'nother review). When you look at the menu, there are many options for their chicken (and fried squid, which is a must try). You can either order their rice combos or just the meat as a snack. I went with the Samurai Chicken chili flavor with minced pork rice; it was simply delicious. For the price and portion, you cannot beat it. Easily, this place is for the budget conscious looking for something fast, relatively healthy, and a cup of Gong Cha for their friend. For these reasons, I call it the ideal spot for a first Tinder date. To all you serial daters, you can thank me later for that tip ;)**If you enjoyed my review, follow or add me as a friend. I have tons of reviews like this.",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"For what it's worth, Cheers Cut is a decent addition to the Allston food scene by introducing Taiwanese fried chicken (popcorn and gigantic chicken cutlet, no less). The ninja chicken nuggets are their interpretation of Taiwanese fried chicken. True to form, they are crispy and provide a small amount of crunch upon biting into the chicken. The salt and pepper slightly edges out the chili as the chili flavor provides only a very small amount of burn while eating the chicken. Generally, you can do without condiments for the salt and pepper since it's already seasoned pretty well (Basil would prolly elevate this even further). If there's anything to avoid, french fries top the list. Usually, it's not something Asian restaurants do well in the first place and Cheers Cut is no exception. Not particularly crispy and slightly mushy, go with a more traditional appetizer. The decor inside the cafe is pretty cool with the art and dark lighting lending itself to a more ""cool"" and edgy vibe than your typical boba shop. Since the snack joint is sharing space with Gong Cha, you can also easily grab yourself some boba too. I will provide an updated review after trying the sauces and other menu items in the near future; overall, Â this is a pretty cool place to visit for a quick bite or after grabbing dinner in the area. IG: Mood4foodeatery",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,Got the grilled chicken with white rice and veggies combo at 8.50 a plate. Also had the ninja chicken nuggets which i def reccommend !! Soo crispy and juice each chicken nugget !! 4.5 star for portion. I felt like the combo portion or the grill combo portion couldve been a little more. Or maybe thats just me. Haha very clean meal overall. Good for people on a diet. Gong cha is attached to this place. A very good boba tea place in my opinion.,Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"5,"Where can I find both Taiwanese fried chicken and good bubble tea from Gong Cha? Here!!!Cheers Cut shares its location with Gong Cha so you can order both at the same time (though they do have separate registers and you have to pay separately, the cashier manages both and you don't have to go to two different people).The menu isn't super extensive but instead, they offer what they do best: Taiwanese style fried foods like chicken fillets, tofu, and squid. They also have rice combos with these fried proteins or with grilled meat if you're feeling slightly healthier.I got the chicken fillet with minced meat rice and it was so good! The chicken comes with two sauce options and a flavor. I got the honey mustard x2 and asked for the chili flavor, which was a light sprinkle of chili powder on the chicken.I will be back soon to try the other menu items as well as the XL size fried chicken!!",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"Great addition to Allston food scene...Quick bites, fried asian food, bubble tea, and quite well-priced. You know by description that this place will be a hit. And sure enough, if you come here on sundays, the line can go out the door. I came here a few times this week to check out a few of the menu items:Fried squid: great portion, can be shared with 2-3p, juicy tender squid fried in savory batter. Tried the salt and pepper, which tasted good. It came with tapioca crackers at the bottom, which is great in concept however was soggy and soaked in oil. Perhaps put the crackers on top next time?Giant chicken: tender meats with nice crunch into each bite. I would say this is also 2p portion with rice, unless you are a huge fan of chicken. I love the concept of eating this like a sandwich with the paper wrapper.Ninja chicken nuggets: pretty good bites, comparable to other taiwanese places like Dolphin Bay, try their thai spicy sauce with this.Oyster Mushrooms: one of my favorite dishes here and great alternative for vegans. Mushrooms were perfectly cooked with juicy mushroom flavors coming through each bite.Minced meat rice: if you are a pork fan get it, if you don't like eating tiny pieces of pork fats skip this altogether.Fishcake: tasted good, doesn't blow me away though. I am a HUGE fan of Gong Cha so the fact that they are in the same place has triggered my interest. The only downside is that the registers are separated for the two places which means a longer wait time in line.",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"The long lines can be daunting, but their signature chicken and giant fried squid is worth trying! Appetizer portions are quite generous and I feel there's no need to get the combo (which includes a choice of rice/minced meat rice/curry rice/french fries and salad side.) If you want to get a little bit of everything, option A9 (Appetizer Combo) is a great choice as it has chicken, beef, and squid in a single serving.The place also has some seating although big groups might find a bit more challenging to be seated on weekends. My only two cents for this place would be to possibly split the lines for Cheers Cut and Gongcha (Bubble Tea vendor sharing the space with Cheers Cut) to speed up the ordering process. Overall, it's a great snacking joint that us Bostonians have been waiting for!",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"I may or may not have been periodically checking in on the progress of this place from the day it was announced to when it opened, and I am so excited to have a place to hang out while I get my boba and snack fix. Gong Cha is by far my favorite Boston boba shop, so to have Cheers Cut join them in a cafe-style location is a dream come true. Admittedly, getting work done here is horrible for my waistline.I got the Minced Meat Rice (lu rou fan), which was fantastic. It was well flavored and tender. In my own experience making the dish, I've run into problems where it comes out too oily or salty (by virtue of all the soy sauce and pork belly), but both these issues were generally avoided here. Also, for $5, the dish was massive. The value!I also got an order of ""Ninja Chicken Nuggets"" otherwise known as Taiwanese popcorn chicken. Don't let the word ""nuggets"" fool you, these pieces of chicken are very much whole. It was well marinaded and practically popped in your mouth. The chicken was at that perfect just-cooked level, where there were no mushy undercooked parts, but none of the juiciness was lost either. I do wish it were a bit crispier, but the pros far outweighed the cons here.As an aside for service, the fact that it is a shared space makes ordering and pickup a bit confusing. The cashier for Cheers Cut and Gong Cha are the same, but with two registers, so if you want something from each place you get rung up twice. The pickup locations are also separate, so it's a bit confusing. My order got labeled as ""Pick Up"" instead of ""Dine In"" by mistake and my number never got called for the lu ro fan. It was a bit annoying, but hopefully these issues will be resolved once they get used to being open (and busy)! I look forward to updating my review to delete this section of it!",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"I would give 3.5 stars for this place. The price is reasonable comparing with the taste. The taste is ok, the price is cheap, and the portion is big!

(I'm sure it was all over Taiwan.) If you're a fan of Hot Star's fried chicken, which is the famous place in Shilin Night Market in Taipei, then this would be a good place to try. The place in the Super 88 food court was decent (also from a Taiwanese chain), but since it closed, this is the closest thing I can find that would be most similar to the great fried chicken places in Taiwan. At least these are similar in size to the ginormous ones there. There are three flavors: salt and pepper, chilli, and plum. I've only tried the salt and pepper and will try the chilli which sprinkles chilli powder on to make it spicy. The staff will ask what sauce you want. I usually eat mine plain and have not needed any sauce to go with the chicken. The fried squid is tasty too, even though they cut it up so it doesn't look like the display item (too bad).",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"5,"An amazing sandwich shop with great service.

My lobster roll was a generous portion but I found the meat to be flavorless and wish they'd seasoned it a bit more. My dad and sister both loved the pasta though I personally felt it was more Alfredo like and had less of that gooey, cheesy consistency that Mac n' cheese is so loved for. The wings were fine, though it doesn't matter because you shouldn't come here and order wings regardless! My dad left his backpack in the store on accident -- he was understandably worried because it had his camera, laptop, wallet, everything.

Neptune had too much roll and tough stringy nibble pieces like chef used my order to dump the lobster scraps. Menu on board was confusing. I may have tried a meatball or two if appetizer. A beer would have been nice...",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Classic Cold mayo lobster roll that comes with chips but you can upgrade to fries. The fries were fresh and hot when we got them- delicious! This place is awesome!!! You can what you want. Straight up lobster meat on a potato roll. The lobster is not overdressed and tastes fresh. We ate lobster rolls all over Boston but this is one of the best. Â No frills, fresh, Â delicious and completely reasonably priced. What more can you ask for??!",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Quick place to get lobster rolls in Little Italy! The lobster rolls were stuffed with lobster meat and the bread was so beautifully toasted. They come in two different ways, hot and buttered, and cold with mayonnaise. I personally would recommend the hot and buttered more as you get more of the lobster flavor, but mayonnaise is the more traditional way. Highly recommend and the cost was fairly low compared to most places without sacrificing quality!",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,Great lobster rolls. Walk up to the counter to order. When your food is ready and the call your number enjoy!,Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"If you're wishing to splurge on lobster rolls, this is the place to visit! Both their hot and cold rolls are worth the indulgence. They aren't skimpy on the lobster claws stuffed inside each roll. I counted at least 3 whole claws in mine. The freshness is indisputable. I prefer the hot roll because the butter is melted and the taste of the lobster is more detectable than the cold. It just feels more hearty. It is also a few bucks more expensive. You get chips with each roll (just don't forget to grab them), and you can also order extra sides such as onion rings. We spent $44 total on two rolls and onion rings for lunch. Don't expect empty seating on the weekends, this place gets very packed. Get to go or come early. I'll be back to try their pastas soon!!",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,Had a hot and cold Lobster roll. Both were amazing. Service was extremely helpful and friendly in helping my sister and I decide what to order. Definitely a must try when visiting Boston,Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"2,"Pauli's!!!! Please invest in your employees just a tad bit. They don't even care to recommend something other than the Loster Roll. Im like ""for Christ Sake, can you tell me one thing other than the lobster roll to spend money on in your establishment?!"" The answer was basically HELL NO! Get your water and Lobster Roll get out!!!!! NOW!",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN BOSTON! Hands down this is the place you need to go to! Try the fondue and the gnudi! This place is not good for groups, so this deliciousness is best kept as an intimate affair! What can I say about the fondue? The portobello was grilled to perfection and the fondue itself was flawless! My gnudi was delicious! It was a pretty filling plate that I would ORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN!Make your way here!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Yep, Grotto is located at or beneath street level at Bowdoin Street, which is not far from the Capitol Dome and the State House. It's fancy Italian which is really great for lunch. Oops.They have a nice lunch menu with set prices for one or two courses. Three of us at the table landed on the bolognaise for lunch, which was a delicious choice. It didn't look like much because it was served on a huge dish but the pasta already tossed with sauce turned out to be a very good portion. Rich, meaty, garlicky and delicious, I nabbed the last piece of bread from the basket to scoop up the little bit of sauce that was left. Delicious.It's not a very big restaurant - maybe a dozen tables of two- and four-tops - but they do a fine lunch and I'd bet, a better dinner.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Ready to finish this draft as a 5 but had a very non-Grotto experience this Friday. Table of 4 at 6 pm before U2. Expected from previous experiences to be out in an hour or so. App and wine came within minutes and then we waited over AN HOUR for main course in 1/2 full dining room! No communication about issues. The food came out and was tremendous as usual. But wow. Talk to us! Oh and it's the most over priced calamari (3 small pieces buried under greens) on the planet. Come on Grotto, you're better than that! Still a big fan. Will be back. You should go. Chalk it up to bad night.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,Really enjoyed our meal.There are a couple of not so good tables in the restaurant (to close to the kitchen runway) and unfortunately we got one of them.Other than that the evening and meal was great.,Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"5,"I. DON'T. CARE. HOW. LONG. THE. WAIT. IS! OMG this place is amazing! Prepare for a food coma!! Me and my partner searched for Italian places to go whilemany would suggest going to little Italy (North End) there is absolutely no need. Being a New Yorker I can certify that this place is of the highest regard. From the service to the food everything is spectacular! It is a nice ambient restaurant for that romantic getaway with your s/o or friend. We had the Gnocchi, Carne, fondue, duck and chocolate cake and it was superb. Zagat rated. But by far the best Italian spot I've seen in Boston. I hope to come back again in the near future!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"5,This is such a cute place tucked away in the heart of Boston. It is a bit underground and the interior is all brick - really romantic atmosphere. You have to get the black truffle garlic soup - it will set you free. The short rib gnocchi also to die for. I loved this place! One of my favorites in Boston and I will be back next time I'm in town!,Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,"This was our first time at Grotto and we would definitely go back. Warning, this place is very small and dark so would not be recommended for little kids. But it's a great date night spot.They participated in restaurant week and by far had the most choices for any restaurant week location I've been too.For appetizers we got mussels which came in a picatta sauce, and a toasted mozzarella caprese salad. Both were very good. The bread was average and was saved by the dipping oil.Very good wine and drink selection, especially for a place without a sit down bar. They offer two different sizes of wines by the glass, and half and full bottles.I had the chicken parm. This was by far the best chicken parm I've ever had. Great presentation that you don't see at most places. And the home made pasta and sauce was awesome. Chicken parm is usually a heavy dish. Â But not so here even though it was a very fair portion size. My girlfriend had the sea bass which was very good as well.For dessert we got the warm chocolate cake (my favorite) and the mixed berries. We were starting to get full but both were very good.We would definitely go back and would recommend Grotto to others. Quick/friendly service with great food. They could invest in a little more lighting while still keeping the intimate feel.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,"I came here for Restaurant Week last summer. I had the lobster Fra Diavolo as my main, and it was delicious. Spicy, but not too spicy. The Fraser was also great. Â The restaurant is very dark, and not well-light, as it is garden level.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"1,"Loved the location. Absolutely, adored the decor. Was very nice to have been 'subterranean'. Appetizer. Crab ravioli. My friend went with the beet salad. She seemed to enjoy it. The ravioli was nice, the shaved almonds were a great addition- Added some crunch Drinks. Initially my date ordered a glass of white wine and simultaneously It was overruled and I ordered a bottle of something red. Even still, the glass of white wine was brought to the table. Wait we asked for the bottle instead? And, they charged me for it. We did not drink it. Very odd Entree. This is where everything went sideways. Date ordered the haddock. Me, the gnocchi. Her haddock came out. And, a Bolognese for me. Wait... I ordered the gnocchi? The bolognese actually looked lovely, but has a three meat base, one of which is pork. Unfortunately, I don't eat pork. So. I let the waiter know. They took the dish back. Not really an apology and did not offer to keep my friends plate warm while we waited for them to fix the error. 20 minutes later. The gnocchi comes out. It was an unexciting dish. And my friends haddock was ice cold by this point. Somehow we were left without a clear apology. And, honestly I did not feel right to have paid for a dish that was sitting there for 20-25 minutes. Dessert. Again. They brought out TWO wrong desserts and we are left to re order A place like Grotto. You don't visit just for food and location. It is experience. That's why I ventured out to try it based on great recommendations. Maybe it was an off night. Maybe not. But, I did not enjoy the meal and to leave feeling like the restaurant owes me something, was a horrible feeling to have had. An apology. A make up for allowing my dates dish to age. Where, really offering to re make hers while they correct my order would be the expectation. After all, We came there to the eat together. The unexpected glass of white wine. The wrong desserts. All of these aren't HUGE blunders - other than the dish going cold. But, the way in which things were handled. Really was not right. Grotto. You have great potential- but the treatment of your customers needs to improve",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Intimate restaurant with Italian comfort food.I would've probably never found Grotto but someone gave me a gift card so my husband and I tried it out. I made a reservation for a Saturday night around 5:30pm. We came inside and there was only one other couple dining at the time. The music was at a perfect volume and despite the cold air outside, it was cozy at our small booth table. We chose the prix fixe menu for $35: an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I chose the carozza to start: a lightly breaded and seared piece of fresh buffalo mozzarella, wilted spinach, and a tomato sauce. The cheese was perfectly fresh and savory and the spinach cooked just the right amount.For the pasta, I got the gnocchi with short ribs. Man, oh man. This was the epitome of comfort food, ideal for a cold winter night. Then, to finish, I chose the panna cotta with lemon and raspberry. Overall, it was a delicious meal but nothing blew me away so I'll stick to four stars. The service was friendly and timely. This is a nice spot for a special occasion or quiet night out.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"5,"First off, my pictures do not do this place justice. Everything I ate was so incredibly delicious and flavorful that I couldn't put my fork down. Our waiter was very helpful and offered great recommendations. I opted for the $36 pick three option and it was perfect! Starter: steak fondue - GET THIS. It was sooooooo good. Tender steak, perfectly seasoned mushrooms, and some kind of heavenly cheesy sauce to dip. Entree: my husband and I both got the short rib gnocchi and pretty much licked our plates clean. The perfect choice on a cold December night. Dessert: bread pudding - such a unique spin! Served with pumpkin spice ice cream. This bread pudding was the best I've ever had.Perfect spot for a cozy romantic date night or dinner with a couple friends. A reservation is necessary due to this space being very intimate, only about 10 or so tables.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,"I came here with my three siblings, husband and brother-in-law for dine out boston. The best thing about eating with family? You can have a taste of what everyone ordered! Apps were all delicious. You seriously can't go wrong with any of the items we ordered, listed from most fave to fave - Â Fonduta (cheese fondue), Piccata (Mussels), Zafferano (Crab ravioli), Mare (Grilled calamari), Cavatelle (House prepared ricotta pasta). What really helps is the sauce, particularly from the cheese fondue, zafferano, and piccata dishes. We ordered more bread so we could dose it with sauce from those plates!Entrees weren't as impressive and the majority of the table ended up wishing we got ordered else. Â My husband loved the meatballs from his spaghetti and meatballs dish. My two sisters and i ordered the Gnocchi. We agreed that we would not order it again. Although the short ribs were tender, the gnocchi, which should be the star of the dish, tasted gummy and unseasoned. My brother and brother-in-law both ordered the grilled beef tenderloin and had mixed opinions, which stemmed from the grill of the meat. If you like medium/well done meat, then this is for you. If you're a medium rare lover like me, don't. Get dessert here. We were all a fan of the dessert that we got - Cioccolato (melting chocolate cake w/ vanilla ice cream), Budino (banana bread pudding w/ caramel ice cream), and Panna Cotta (Lemon w/ raspberry sauce)! I recommend going with the Budino or Cioccolato if you aren't very full, but if you are and just want something refreshing, get the Panna Cotta.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Grotto was sooooo good!The atmosphere was very intimate and set the mood, which is great for a romantic date, but if you go for anything else I'm not sure this is the right place. The staff was so friendly and very helpful in answering all of my questions and making great recommendations. I will say the amount of food you get for the price isn't quite on par with other restaurants in the area, so that was a little disappointing, but they do make everything from scratch so the flavor almost makes it worth the price. They also have a 'tasting' menu where you can get 3 courses (including dessert) for either $30 or $40, depending on your choices. If I go back, I'll definitely look into that option more because everything I tried this time (the cavatelli and short rib gnocchi) was delicious!Overall, I had a good experience at Grotto. It was a bit pricey, but if you need a restaurant for a special occasion I definitely recommend it!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"3,"Grotto is a small Italian restaurant, which is slightly dark with romantic vibes. The entrance of the restaurant is a little awkward with curtains and stairs. We came for Restaurant Week for dinner, which was $38 a person. With three courses each, I wasn't especially wowed. +BREAD & OLIVE OIL: Complimentary. The olive oil has a strong olive flavor, while the bread has a nicely salted crust. +BUDINO: Probably my favorite of the night, as the combination of the banana bread pudding and salted caramel ice cream is wonderfully delicious!-INSALATA: The combination of prosciutto, lemon, and parmesan is tasty, but honestly just what is expected. Perhaps more prosciutto would be nice as there was much more arugula.-PETTINI: Described as a scallop ""ravioli,"" but honestly wouldn't call it that at all. The ""ravioli"" was two sheets of pasta with a lot of arugula between in. The construction of it was honestly a little confusing. However, the scallops were well cooked with a nice sear on the outside. My boyfriend got the duck leg as the appetizer, which needed some salt but otherwise tasty. His entree was gnocchi with short ribs, but the gnocchi was disappointingly not fluffy. While parts of our meals were tasty, others were just okay, leaving something to be desired.All in all, the experience we had here was just okay. Perhaps it was just because it was Restaurant Week though. The restaurant was a little too dark, and the food was decent but left me a little doubtful with a normally $$$ price tag.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"1,"We had a dinner in this restaurant. The good was just ok, the service very slow. Espresso was served almost cold and the tiramisu without any hint of coffee was served with a big big spoon which is too big to reach the bottom of the glass.  However, the best part was a huge cockroach just behind us on the wall. Can just guess how tidy this place.Never coming back!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"5,"I've been to Grotto 3 times now and it never fails to disappoint. It's a small, romantic restaurant that is a recently discovered hidden treasure. I've never eaten the pre-fix because I know I'll realistically not be able to finish it, but every entree I've eaten has been delicious. The ambiance is perfect and the servers are extremely well-mannered and polite. Did I mention the food? I usually don't love gnocchi but they made the second best I've ever had (second to a restaurant I've gone to.. in Italy). It melts in your mouth and has all the right combinations. The bolognese has all the right flavors too. I can't get enough of the Cioccolato dessert either, and I order it every time. Overall I HIGHLY recommend!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Grotto is super small and very dark- be prepared to use your phone to look at the menu. The ambiance was very nice but also a little loud because it's so small. I got the pumpkin risotto with mozzarella and pomegranate - it was AMAZING! The flavor was so rich and the sauce was so creamy. I absolutely loved it and there was so much that I took over half of it home. The spaghetti & meatballs were good too, the meatballs were huge! It was a little hard to catch up with my friend with the noise but overall we had a good experience. Â Good glass of Chianti for $14.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"5,"As good as it gets for sure! I cant believe it too me so long to find this place (well I guess because of the location, I can). Its quietly tucked under street level at Bowdin street. Right in the heart of Boston. Its a quiet little romantic spot where the food is always delicious. I love to bring clients here for lunch. We never have a bad meal and the service is amazing. Â I highly suggest giving Grotto a try!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"3,"The atmosphere of Grotto is certainly romantic as long as your table isn't near the door where newcomers hover over you (there's nowhere else to wait) or the kitchen. Â The service is excellent once you're seated. Â It can take a while for one of the staff to see that you're waiting near the door, which is awkward for you and for those seated near the door. Â This is true even if you have a reservation; there's no way to check in without peeking through the curtains at the door. Â The food is good. Â Unfortunately, it's impossible to see anything. Â It's uncomfortably dark, even with the many tealight candles. Â The restaurant hasn't made any accommodations for being able to read the menu or being able to see your food. Â An appetizer with sausage had unexpected mushrooms; we couldn't see them listed on the menu and missed seeing them in the dish itself. Â The chicken parmesan has a unique presentation, which might be fun, but it's weird when you can't see it. Â The bread pudding is delicious, even in the dark.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Cute little hole-in-the-wall place with delicious Italian food. My boyfriend and I come here every year for Valentine's day and the restaurant is dark but the candlelight makes a great romantic dinner!

Great food - my son had the French toast and I had the breakfast burrito - both excellent and a good portion for the value. Â If I am back in Boston I would definitely go again.

Had some trouble finding it as its inside a warehouse or dock. Looks like some local guys serving up home cooking for the dock workers. Some locals have caught on too. I ordered Tony's special; two eggs any style, two meats, French toast or pancakes served with home fries.

It was awesome to get wonderful food at a fair price with friendly staff members. It's a very busy place, fresh hot food, employees yelling out orders left and right.

One of the employees even told us how to get to nearby water spray park because we were all just sweaty hot. Go Boston!",Pete's Dockside,"12 Channel St Boston, MA 02210"4,"This place is a pretty classic definition of overwhelming but in a positive, ""decide the next time you're coming back"" while standing in line sort of way. Price is excellent, as are the portions. You really can get almost anything you would want to eat here. There is a good amount of seating and food is VERY fresh, so blow on it (speaking from a burnt tongue). I had the shrimp plate and was delighted, my friends had various sandwiches (served with SOOOO much meat) and the crab cakes and there were no negative reviews. There is a pretty good amount of seating but you can expect to wait a bit in line if you go during lunch. The only thing that looked tastier than the options for lunch were those for breakfast and brunch so my sole disappointment really was the time of day I happened to show up. The only other downside is it's a lot to take in your first time, the menu is massive and that doesn't even include the daily specials so I am not even sure if I ate what I would have if the amount of people in tight quarters hadn't made me feel rushed.

The location and restaurant are both great and the service, even better. Our server, Derek, was extremely attentive and overall great. We ordered the clam chowder, clam ceviche, fish dip, and mussels. The ceviche came out first and set the tone for the rest of the meal. It was tasteless and lacked lemon, a prime ingredient in a ceviche. The pineapple was a welcome taste but did not bud well with the obviously fresh clams. Maybe my opinion and understanding of a ceviche is different than what this restaurant had in mind, but we ended up returning the item. The rest of the good was good, enjoyable, but nothing out of this world. The best part was the clam chowder though it lacked spices - nothing a little black pepper can't fix. We decided against ordering a main dish and asked for our tab. Derek so kindly asked if we were in a hurry and we let him know we were not. He brought us out a delicious chocolate mousse dessert and won me over. He took care of the ceviche on the bill and went above and beyond to correct what was surely not his mistake. We made sure to let the restaurant manager what an incredible job Derek did and it did not go unnoticed. Unfortunately cannot give more than 3 stars as the food was not beyond average but Derek deserves all the stars.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"This place is amazing. The atmosphere is high class, yet welcoming. The chef is a talent. I occasionally take risks with what I eat here, and the chef makes me truly enjoy foods I have never really been a fan of previously. I've sat everywhere in the restaurant, and all of the staff is amazing. In the lounge, our waitress was charismatic and welcoming - along with every server I've encountered in the dining area, and the bar. The owner, Meki, and manager, Peter, are very hands on and go above and beyond to please every customer. Whenever I go in I see them very involved in every customers experience. Fin Point, I will definitely see you soon!!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"I had such a great time I feel the need to tell you about this place! We came with a large party (23) completely last minute. They have a private back room where they immediately set up 3 large tables for us. Service throughout the night was on point. But the food really knocks you out of the park! We had a plethora of appetizers. Hands down you must try the octopus. Its grilled to perfection. Completely reminded me of a nice steak while I was eating it and it was so good we ordered another one! We also tried the shrimp tacos, poke, razor clam crudo, baby back ribs, and bruschetta and prosciutto. They have us bread to hold us over for our entrees and even the bread was soft and baked to perfection. For entrees, I got the filet mignon. It's served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Flavor was great and all mixed well. My friends got the halibut and the tuna ahi steak which was also all very good. The tuna ahi is a thick cut! It was even bigger than my 8oz filet! At the end, we were served a dessert platter and ice cream! The entrees did take a little long to arrive, but our party was so last minute it was completely understandable. Ultimately the food was worth the wait. I'm definitely coming back here.. especially for that octopus!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,This place is in a very cute part of town and the service was excellent.

My husband said it was the best Bloody Mary he had ever had (it was so spicy)! Lobster Benedict is a must try and I loved the French toast and the waffle looked amazing. Quick note for families - We travel a lot with our 1 year old daughter and I am used to the scared or annoyed looks from waitstaff (babies rarely add to the tab and make a mess) - BUT this place not only accommodated our larger group with a private room, they smiled and talked to my daughter and made sure she was taken care of. From our sweet server, the manager, hostess and even one of the cleaning staff, they all spoke kind words and worked well together as a team.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"3,"Great location. Fun, funky vibe. Â Decent variety of food even for non-seafood eaters. Good for large groups including a separate room that can be reserved. Â Food is fresh and hot. Service was excellent.

Good service, tasty cocktail and pleasant atmosphere.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,I love coming to Fin Point! Their food is one of the greatest around Boston and the restaurant's interior is stunning! We also got a complimentary dessert from the house for my birthday. We were pleased and happy!,Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"Fin Point is attached to the Hilton hotel and hotel restaurants can be a bit of hit or miss. Tonight's experience was a hit. Great service, lovely atmosphere, terrific seafood.My dinnermate chose the clam chowder and said it was well packed with clams. I had the tuna tacos to start. Really well filled with spicy tuna and the corn shells were excellent. I ate every bite and even picked up the bits that fell out on the plate.For main course, we both chose the scallops. Not a huge portion with just three large scallops on a tasty risotto. Perfectly cooked, nicely plated. Very nice.Totally could return to Fin Point.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"I came this morning for Easter brunch with my family and everything was so amazing! Decoration of the restaurant is really impressive, great service and excellent food! Definitely will come next time! Ps- cucumber lemonade is one of the best brunch cocktail I ever tried!!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"Great spot real convenient if you're staying at the Hilton, other than that it's a great spot anyway. Really good breakfast nice staff lots of fun",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"An amazing restaurant! From the host greeting us to the desserts, everything was top-notch. Especially notable was the service - Ellie was professional, welcoming and knowledgeable, she made our last night in this city as good as it could possibly get. I am definitely coming back to try more from the menu whenever I am in Boston.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,The care and attention to detail is apparent everywhere at Fin Point. A beautiful space with kind and helpful staff serving high quality drinks and food. I was pleasantly surprised by what a high end but comfortable bar/restaurant Fin Point is. Great spot in a great location. Definitely recommend giving it a visit.,Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"The best dining and service experience hands down! Â I was so happy that we dined at Fin Point for my husband's birthday while in Boston. This restaurant is located in the Hilton. The ambiance is wonderful and they have a great bar area, too. Ellie was our server and we loved everything about her from her very attentive and caring service to her friendliness and smile to her knowledge about wine and the menu. Her recommendations were spot on. Ellie enhanced our dining experience. When I questioned the spiciness of the ceviche, she appeared at the table with a tasting. She went over and above normal service. We started with a great bottle of wine and the grilled octopus. The octopus was perfectly grilled with a nice roasted flavor. There was one large tentacle on the plate with micro greens, lemon roasted artichokes and wonderful aioli sauces. A perfect starter. My husband had the special fish for the evening which was the striped bass. He thoroughly enjoyed the dish. The fish was moist and flaky and the sauce made the dish. I had the daily ceviche and the beet salad. The ceviche was fresh and flavorful with poblanos and citrus. It was served with two large chips. The beet salad was phenomenal, the best I've ever had. It had yellow and red beets with goat cheese, baby greens, pecans and apricots with a sherry vinaigrette. We ended our meal with a cappuccino for me and a 20yr port for my hubby. Ellie surprised my husband with a chocolate mousse dessert with a candle for his birthday. Â It was so perfect! Â Ellie also took a few photos for us. We so enjoyed everything about Fin Point! Â Ask for Ellie if you dine with them!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"Wow! Â This place is AMAZING. Â First, I arrived well before my party and the host was extremely accommodating. Â When our party arrived, we were seated with the best server. Â She was very knowledgeable and a great guide. Â She informed us of the specials and answered our questions. Â We could not stop commenting on how great she was. Â She even told us that she is a dancer with a focus on urban dance and hip hop. Â The fresh oysters were scrumptious. Â My linguini and clams were the best I have tasted. Â Everyone at our table was extremely impressed with the mussels, Â the lobster roll, the ceviche, and the tuna tacos. Â The staff then tops this perfection of a meal with their chef's special dessert. Â We are going back tomorrow for dollar oysters from 1-4!!!!!This place is a must visit gem here in Boston!!!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"First time at Fin Point and definitely coming back. I had the most relaxing afternoon having coffee at this beautiful place, I love the ambiance! Good place to sit and relax. I was debating between the chopped salad and the Tuna salad( both sounded very good), but my waitress recommended the tuna salad saying it was amazing and I was sold.And indeed it was something I had never tried anywhere else, the dressing was out of this world. After having a great lunch my server asked if I wanted to look at the dessert menu. I am not a big dessert person but my experience was already very good and I wanted to try something else. My server recommended the strawberry shortcake and she was right, one of the best desserts I've ever had. The cake was perfectly done and the chantilly cream was to die for!! I am definitely coming back to have some dinner and cocktails!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"4,"we were wandering Boston when we saw $1 oysters from 12-4, which is honestly just what we were looking for. We each got a drink and a dozen oysters. They were fresh and delicious and presented well. The wait staff was really nice and the ambiance is lovely. The $1 oysters are on Saturday and sundays, and definitely worth a stop in you're wandering about that part of town.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"Fin Point never disappoints. Â From the delicious food to the beautiful decor it is definitely a top notch restaurant. Â The new summer menu is amazingly delicious, especially the shrimp tacos. Â If you just want to hang out with friends, watch the game on TV, or celebrate a special occasion, Fin Point is the place. Highly recommended for everyone and every occasion.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"My husband said the eggs Benedict with lobster were quite tasty. I enjoyed a gluten free avocado toast with marinated shallots , paired with a Bloody Mary. The waitress made sure to check if the marinated shallots were safe for someone with Celiac disease. She stated that allergy concerns is one of the reasons they do not have a buffet option at this restaurant (it happens to be connected to a Hilton hotel). The eggs for both dishes were perfectly poached. We would visit again.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"5,"The Barking Crab is located right on the water. The place has much personality and most importantly it has some great tasting food. When I went to wash my hands I noticed that the sign on the men's restroom has a sign of the artist formerly known as Prince. Oh yes so cool. We ordered the basics and it was delicious. Parking can be really tough in the area so consider a car service. I spent $24.00 dollars for an hour at a lot nearby with a maximum of 54.00 so be careful where you park. I would reclined eating here, it was delicious",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"3,"Ambiance: 5 stars! Super fun, live band, right on the water. BUT - outside is super loud. This is expected with the live band, so be expected to literally yell at your table to hear one another. Service: 1.5 stars. Super huge mess. There is no communication between outside and inside, so our 45 minute wait turned into a 1.5 hour wait because both outside and inside thought the other had a table for us. Very confused staff. Once we were seated, our waitress was pretty disinterested in general. Food: 4 stars. Amazing seafood as expected! Everyone enjoyed their food. I got the salad (gluten free!) and it was super pricey for a pretty basic salad. Next time I will go with a entree for the same price! Still good, though. Expect to spend a good chunk of money here.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"One of the traditional restaurants of the Seaport District, the Barking Crab has an outdoor bar/tent area and an indoor dining room area. The waiting lists, as I learned, are completely separate. As far as I know, they have the same menu.We opted not to wait for the outside seating and instead enjoyed a table at the inside dining room with a window overlooking the seaport area and a small marina. Close enough, right?Starting off with an appetizer of peel and eat shrimp, they were cooked perfectly with onions and green peppers, served with a sharp cocktail sauce and a wedge of lemon. My only problem was that it would have been awesome if they had deveined the shrimp as some of them had recently eaten well, if you know what I mean.For mains, a fried fish sandwich was a good portion with excellent fries, cole slaw and a pickle. Delicious and nicely cooked. And then, a ""fire-grilled lobster"" was a very good portion, cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Plenty of meat in this bugger and not hard to eat as the appropriate utensils and a plastic bib were provided.Service was friendly and efficient. No problems at all.Barking Crab isn't fancy and it's not really a date place. But the food is good and for seaport seafood, a solid choice.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"3,"I was in town for business with my boss and her soon.We were looking for some seafood place to eat and she mentioned this place.It is located in a nice area and I loved the ""beachy"" decoration.The restaurant was busy but our food came out quit fast.I had the lobster mac and cheese and my boss had clam chowder and lobster roll.My mac and cheese was really great but 35$ for a mac and cheese (including tip and no drinks) it is a little bit too much, even though it had lobster in it.The service was okay, the food was good but I wasn't impressed.I think it is a cool place to visit but it will not be on my list on the next time I come to Boston.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"Famous and popular tourist restaurant with seafood fixings. Now this is a very popular spot in Boston Harbor where they dump the tea but I really enjoy the ambiance versus the quality and portion of the seafood. The seafood is good since I had the lobster roll and the fried clams but considering I've eaten other seafood places, I have had I better experience elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, the food was tasty but just living in New England, I've just had a bigger and fresher portion of seafood up the seacoast we're at Sea to table.The place is fun and the service was very nice with this one. Wonderful server called Felipe. The only thing I don't like about this place was that there was tartar sauce on the floor that they forgot to clean up so I end up stepping on it when I was seated. I was trying to figure out what was slippery under my shoe sole as I got up.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"3,"This place has been around for such a long time and has a fun, kinda kitschy vibe to it. Right on the water, there are lobster traps with strings of lights wound around them on the ceiling. Food was pretty good. We shared the fried clams and chowder as apps. Both were good. The fried clams stayed crisp and the chowder had great flavor and perfect thickness to it. I shared the sesame ahi tuna and the baked lobster roll with my friend. The tuna came with rice and seaweed salad and rice and was pretty tasty. The lobster was pretty dry and didn't have much butter on it. The coleslaw it came with was too sweet but the fries were perfectly crispy. It was annoying to get a table. There are two entrances/hostesses depending on where you want to sit. We weren't super particular on where to sit, we just wanted a table but they kept sending us back and forth and each time we went to the other side the other hostess was nowhere to be found. We eventually just wound up sitting at the bar. Overall was a fun place with a funky ambiance. My brother got the swordfish and he seemed to really like it",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"This place is great. Yes its a tourist trap and you can get the same food a lot cheaper some place else but its still a fun time. The food is very good and definitely up to par with other seafood places in the area. It was very fresh. The lobster roll is still one of favorites, they really load it up, good thing too its 30 dollars. They have a great booze menu too. Lots of local beers/ciders on tap. Â I'll be back for sure.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"1,"Definitely a tourist trap. Don't go there for the food, this is a drinking place. The food is overpriced, the portions are small and not a lot of thought put into it. Service was incredibly slow, tables were sticky, but it seems like a lot of locals like the place.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"3,"Ahh the Barking Crab, the true Bostonian tourist trap. It's the ultimate New England restaurant you should experience at least once in your life, but not for the quality of the food...it's for the atmosphere. Some things you should know:1. It's right on the water so it's a great view 2. Great patio & outdoor-ish restaurant with appropriate nautical decor3. Friendly service4. Loud & always crowded5. The waitstaff is almost always more ethnically diverse than the patrons6. Make reservations if you have a big group7. Not vegetarian friendly unless you wanna eat sides or salads8. Lots of tourists9. Drinks are pricey & not very strong but tasty. 10. Seafood is fresh, pricey, & somewhere between mediocre & Whole Foods take-out in terms of tasteYou come here for the really fun atmosphere. I'd encourage sharing some plates if you're trying to save some monies. Probably better off getting food to-go from Yankee's & then hanging around the Barking Crab for the bar.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"Wow, first time here and we loved it. We got two 2lb fire grilled lobsters with crab dip and the fisherman's sampler. Our eyes were a lot bigger than our stomachs because that was definitely too much food for two people, we ended up taking the fried stuff home. The service outside wasn't the most attentive at first but I also wasn't expecting it to be on a Saturday night. It's a busy loud place and that's the allure. Definitely will be back here!",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"3,"Look, you're probably going to go to the Barking Crab anyway so what else can be said? Yes, their clam chowder was delicious but so are a lot of other places. Their lobster roll was also good but charging $28 for it was criminal. It didn't stand out as any more amazing than any of the other places we tried other than it's enormous price tag. The Barking Crab is a tourist trap. We were tourists and got trapped but still enjoyed our food and had a good time. It's basically a shellfish party in a large circus tent. Prepare to come early or expect a long wait. Or just do what we did and sneak up the the bar. Just keep in mind you're going to pay more for food and drink here than other places.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"5,"I started with the crab dip. I was surprised with the lightness and freshness of the dish. This selection was delicious and with the $11 price. I also had Cloppino - Dungeness crab, calamari, mussels, shrimp in a tomato broth of peppers onion garlic. Simply delicious! The steamers were well cooked & tasty. Highly recommend you stop by this casual style restaurant.dine inside or outside with live music. Fun carefree atmosphere. Great intro to waterfront dining.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"This is one of the better known seafood places in Boston and every single time I went there was always over an hour wait. Also good to know that they don't take same day reservations. They have a great outdoor seating area overlooking seaport building and water. I got the naked lobster roll which came with fries and coleslaw. The lobster roll was amazing and they put a lot of meat on. Didn't care too much for the fries and coleslaw. We also split the fisherman's platter which was an assortment of fried seafood (clam strips, scallops, shrimp, fish) which was also a good appetizer. The food lived up the hype, but was definitely overpriced.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"This is a very assuming restaurant that is on the edge of the water (it is sorta nestled between a bunch of tall buildings) between seaport and downtown. If you look closer, there are a TON of people inside! it has a casual feel with open communal picnic tables and sea chotchkies. This is super reminiscent of one of my favorite restaurants in Siesta Key, FL. The wait staff is quick- we got our drinks super fast (I loved my spiked blueberry lemonade and my friend had the pomegranate martini). These drinks are SUPER SUPER strong. We had the lobster empanadas which were surprisingly amazing! there is a good amount of lobster and the spicy aioli is great. We also got the fish tacos (haddock is what was in that day), which I liked. It was lightly battered with a good amount of lettuce and salsa on the side. I sorta wish it was a mayo slaw but this take was pretty good! also we went on a Saturday during the day and there was a LIVE band, which made us stay for that second drink...which may or may not have been a good thing!",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"I loved this place. It's decor is super cute and it feels right to eat seafood.Oysters were very good and came out immediately.Drink menu had plenty of local beers as well as beer, wine, champagne - everything you need.Staff was attentive to us, despite the bad reviews. We sat at the bar, so maybe that helped. It was nearly full, but the bartender sure made sure we were taken care of. We are easy guests also.It was Winter when we came and the temperature was fine.I'd definitely go back!",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,Delish!Such a cute place on the waterfront and great vibe as well. Â We got a Shrimp Basket and a mixed Seafood Basket - both were awesome. Â Add some cold beers and you are reaching near perfection. Â Lots of fun and great being on the water's edge. Â Really enjoyed it here.,Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"3,"Okay food, imperfect service. We waited at least fifteen minutes for menus, receiving them only after we asked. My companion's meal came before I placed my order; less than desirable. Once I ordered, my meal arrived, but had ingredients that I couldn't eat even though I very clearly identified those that I couldn't eat. Loud, crowded, lively. High prices - the top-end platter was $250! The smallest was $54; hardly a bargain. It's a well-known resto on the dock lands. Govern yourself accordingly.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"Great Hot Crab Dip, and the Barking Crab Roll was amazing. I don't normally go for cold rolls but this one stole my heart. :::Tip::: Use the fist stall in the women's restroom and tell me what happens as your doing your lady squat and someone is drying their hands. :) The Barking Crab was everything the locals say about them. Must Stop if it's your first time in the area.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"3,"On the 4 star verge, but I have decided this was a 3 star average experience... first thing to mention... this is somewhat of an historical landmark eating spot for Boston... so 25yrs around is nothing to sniffle at. Â So, I think this is a must try... if you are in Boston. Â  It was a fun environment.. Â college kids in and out and there were families there as well. Â  It was a really great laid back atmosphere. Â Service was iffy.. but my bartender was new.. which brings on a little forgiveness... so we will let that go. Â The dark and stormy was a wonderful drink.. The 3 stars is with the food.... I had crab cakes, friend scallops, french fries and bacon brussel sprouts... Â The crab cakes and scallops..great. Â  The bacon brussel sprouts were just ok, just ok.. I could barely taste the bacon, but it was there. Â Which means...I'm not sure.. what. Â  And my bill ended at around $65. Â A pricey event for a family friendly joint that's been around for a while and offers a pretty laid back environment. Â So, the 3 stars.. is a must visit.. if you do, bank on the crab cakes and a drink, maybe try a different entree.. :)",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,"On a work trip and met some colleagurs here for dinner before we went to catch our first Red Sox game. Unfortunately, there was a private party outside on the patio - so they had it closed off. That was the first disappointment.So we went inside and the hostess did not take our name doen right away because she was busy in the back, which caused us to lose a quick seating. So, finally after she got out name down, it took about 40 minutes to get seated.Two comments: if you want to make a reservation, call the day before - apparently they do not take same day reservations, which to me sounded really odd for a tourist town in summer. Secondly. If it is a nice day, call ahead to make sure the patio is open. It would be my preference hands down to be eating a d drinking out on the patio - right on the water.Food was good - clam chowder soup and fish and chips with cole slaw did it for me. A couple of my colleagues got lobster and one got mussles and everyone enjoyed their meals. So food was 5 stars, bit staff and policies got 3 stars.....",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"4,I loved the place due to its location more than anything else. Outer seating space is quite large and well taken care of. Has many restaurants in the vicinity but this one still maintains its importance.Food is quite nice and so are the servers. Fishes seem to be fresh and are tasty. Complimentary warm bread and butter are served.,Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"5,As an out of town guest I conducted my research of one of the best seafood restaurants to dine at. Upon arrival they were seating outside and was an immediate turn off as I wanted to dine in a restaurant not outside as carry out! I went inside and received a pager an informed a 40 minute wait. I didn't like it but dealt with it. Seated in 40 minutes.Our waiter was Alex K and I explained my upset and hunger an he immediately assisted me in ordering my dinner and ensured my drink of soda was refreshed and stopped by our table of 4 ensuring a great experience. The Boston clam chowder is better at our hotel the Boston Westin but other than that it was a great dinner. Waiter Alex K is definitely an asset to their restaurant. so far on our weeks stay this is the best restaurant.,Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"3,"Famous chain seafood restaurant that is worth trying once but will likely leave true seafood lovers disappointed. Ordered a bevy of dishes including oysters to start (pretty fresh) and clam chowder (one of the few things worth eating) and drinks (avoid any cocktails on the list as they are weak and not well made).Entrees included the crab cake combo and the seafood casserole. Crab cake combo was shockingly tiny with three tiny, overcooked and over salted shrimps and a bed of lettuce soaked in dressing. Seafood casserole was salty and mostly breadcrumbs with very few pieces of seafood. The one redeeming factor was that the service was fantastic. The waiter we had was very nice, attentive, and friendly. Overall - maybe worth visiting once for lunch if it's your first time but wouldn't stray any further into the menu beyond the clam chowder. Entrees / dinner are overpriced and not that much better than a Red Lobster.",Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"3,"Pretty good food for a chain, but definitely not something I would write home about.The clam chowder was pretty typical. This place just happened to be in a convenient location otherwise I would pass it up.",Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"2,I was pretty disappointed as I have heard a lot of great things about this place. The service took so long. I did go at lunchtime on a Sunday so in their defense it was super busy. But the food was not worth the wait. I got shrimp cocktail and the cocktail sauce is very watery and definitely not house made. I got the house salad which was very bland and the grilled salmon I got with it left a lot to be desired. There were essentially no seasonings. It's like they just put it on the grill in a hurry. Will definitely not go back given all of the other amazing restaurants in this town. Also very touristy.,Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"5,"NICE! Ate dinner here last night and it was the best. Or server was SO attentive and nice!

The hub of early American. The tea party, the massacre, the home of Paul Revere. And seafood. Delicious, fresh, abundant seafood. When I landed I knew I wanted to take advantage of all the fresh seafood I could and another member in my group had been to Legal Seafood before and spoke highly of it.We were there Sunday night but graduation was that day so it was packed. We had about a 45 minute wait but with the aquarium right there and the harbor we enjoyed walking around and seeing the sights while we waited. Our waiter was very helpful in helping us pair wines with all our entrees, I had an oak aged Chardonnay and it was wonderful.I had the lobster roll because of my aforementioned obsession with seafood, and it is nothing to mess with. I had it hot with drawn butter and my mouth was WATERING at the sight of it. Stuffed with succulent fresh lobster on a warm quishy bun of perfection, this lobster roll was very possibly the most satisfying bite of food I've ever taken. The roll goes at market price but I thought it was reasonable for how full of lobster it was. They do not skimp!One of our group members is gluten free dairy free and they were very accommodating of that, they even had gluten free rolls for her and were very careful to keep everything separated. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had to wait a pretty long time for a waiter to come to our table, to take our order, for our food and then our checks. It was busy but it seems like they should be used to that because of its prime location and great reviews.",Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"5,"I ordered the lobster roll with mayo- delicious- because it wasn't smothered with mayo...kids menu had a ""small""Lobster... fun...

Lol. We also ordered some soups and sangrias. The clam chowder was delicious (I don't even like clams) and flavorful but the lobster bisque was bland and underwhelming to say the least. As far as the Sangria goes the liberty one (or at least that's what I think it's called) was very good but the strawberry sangria was a bit too sweet and tasted like medicine. As our main course we both ordered the shrimp pasta and that didn't disappoint. It was flavorful and they didn't skimp on the shrimp. Our server, John, was very polite and attentive.",Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"5,"As seafood lover and a newcomer to Boston, I was so excited to try this place despite some of the low star reviews.

The menu was very well laid out, and the atmosphere a bit upscale beach-bar like. We ordered right away, and our food was brought to us very quickly. We ordered a bowl of Clam Chowder, the Bang Bang Cauliflower, and a Lobster Roll. The Bang Bang Cauliflower was pretty good, my only complaint would be that the Cauliflower was just a bit over-sauced. Other than that I would recommend it!The Clam Chowder was AMAZING. It was creamy, yet light. The pieces of clam in the Chowder were big chunks and they were so fresh they basically melted in your mouth! The Lobster Roll was also fantastic! I never really liked the lobster I had tried before, but I decided to give it another shot. The lobster was also so fresh and buttery. It was so delicious! I cannot wait to come back here.

Lobster bisque is excellent but could use more lobster pieces. Â Rolls are divine!! Â The baked, stuffed shrimp was awesome! Â Prices are touristy high but as expected for this location.

We decided to give it a go on our last visit. We ordered a lobster roll and clam chowder. The lobster roll was loaded with lobster and the clam chowder was delicious, but didn't live up to the hype. The service was great though and we got in right away with a reservation.",Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"3,It was nice. It is a chain but it was not bad. Â I would not run to it but I won't say I would not try it some other time. Â I had the crab cake sandwich. Â I have had better. It had lots of crab in it. Sometimes they have to much filling. The fries were okay but a little limp. The slaw was just slaw nothing special,Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"2,I don't get why this place is popular. Â The food is one note and blah. Everything tastes like its cooked in the same old grease. Â The calamari tastes like it was from frozen squid rings. The crab cakes had a nice texture but tasted like a stale crouton. The filet steak was average choice grade. Â Nothing about the food should command the price they charge.Not a fan.,Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Always good and consistently delicious! Any time you are in the Boston area you have to visit Legal seafood. This review is for the one across from the new England aquarium. The service was fantastic, our server was so friendly and gave her honest opinion about two dishes I was deciding between. I ended up with the clam chowder and the lobster roll. Living in florida now, there's nothing better than lobster ftom new England! Also had plenty of options on the kids menu, my kids had a cheeseburger and a little pizza. The clam chowder was nice and thick with excellent flavor and more than enough clam and veggies in the soup. The lobster roll was so buttery with plenty of lobster pieces. We had the Boston Cream pie for dessert which was presented differently in a round small cake but oh my goodness. I don't think I had more than 2 bites because my children attacked that dessert, they loved it! It really was fantastic, we could have ordered 2 more lol. There are several locations in the Boston area, so check their website for a location close to where you will be.",Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Poutine! In Boston! Count me in!I usually reserve my poutine eating habits when I'm in Canada, however to my surprise when finding lunch places along the the Freedom Trail, this place popped up in my radar. Poutine is one of those winter time comfort dishes because it just warms the soul with its crispy, cheesy, gravy goodness. But it's the hottest summer ever. But I'm also in town and I love poutine. Love for poutine over 86 degree humid weather. I just saw more pros than cons in Saus. I ordered the regular sized poutine with classic gravy and topped off with pork belly and crispy shallots. My brother ordered the kimchi fried chicken but as a salad. We even ordered an extra side of the fries to try out their cheddar-ale Saus and their bacon-parm Saus. So good, all of it. The classic sauce isn't too salty that it overpowers the entire dish. The topping options are also spot on to help you customize and balance out your dish. Overall amazing experience. If you are looking for a poutine that rivals our neighbors in the north, then go here!",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"If you're a tourist in the area looking for a place to munch, Saus is really the place to go! Â Most food places in Faneuil Hall / Quincy Market / Haymarket area charge exorbitant prices for half-assed food. Â I'm happy to say that Saus is only semi pricey (haha), and the food is definitely delicious.Saus is a wonderland for tater lovers like myself. Â Fries and Poutine galore! Â Very similar to Pomme Frites in NYC. Â Their potatoes are hand cut in house, and I confirmed this with my best friend who worked there one summer. Â She cut loads. Â Eat your fries gratefully!SAUCES ($0.75)My favorites are the mayos: **Roasted Garlic** and **Secret Saus** (both $0.75). Â Their Truffle Ketchup is strong #bless, and Spicy Sambal has a decent kick for my brethren who enjoy some heat. Â I was guzzling water and I can decently take the heat as an Asian American lol. Â #1 is still Mayos though.SANDWICHES / MEATS IN CARBS ($9)I'd recommend the **Crispy Chicken** or **Pork Carnitas** (both $9). Â They're not life-changing like some of the chicken or carnitas sandwiches I've had in NYC, but they are decently yummy!I didn't like the kimchi in the Kimchi Fried Chicken. It wasn't strong or fermented enough like normal kimchi, but more like a kimchi slaw. Â Idk if this is to make it more palatable to, errr, people who are used to more ~neutral palates~, ahem.I've also tried the Frik too, but didn't realize it would be so thin (this is the standard for Friks FYI). Â If you're looking for value / a filling meal, I'd recommend the sandwich over it especially since both are $9. Â 'Twas not enough for my tall and hungry boyfriend.SWEETSTheir **Liege Waffle + Salted Caramel** ($3 + $0.75) is sooo good. Â It has a nice chew with every bite, albeit it's very small size -- like half a small waffle. Â I am that strange person who desperately needs a bite of sweet when things get too savory, so this waffle really completes me when I'm chowing down on some Poutine.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Poutine- 5/5Liege Waffle- 5/5Spicy tuna roll- 2.5/5Overall, very happy with this place. Casual ambiance, friendly staff, and good food. I wasn't really a huge fan of the spicy tuna roll, it tasted more like a regular tuna salad sandwich. The poutine and waffle were fantastic though and really hit the spot. I definitely want to try the other sandwiches next time I come here.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"While we were in Boston, we wanted a little snack in the evening instead of having a full dinner. We found this spot that focuses on fries. Not just any fries, Belgian style fries! The inside is not big but not too small. They had a large table at the entrance, can be used for a big group, or as a communal table. The rest of the space has seating with smaller table on the left side of the wall. At the back is their kitchen and ordering counter. You need to order your food at the counter, pay for them, and then take your seat. Go back and pick up your food when your name is called.We got Hand Cut Fries. They do have all sorts of poutine and other fancy kinds, but we want to try the very basic one, as we heart it is the best way to get the true flavor. We got two kinds of sauce to go with it, Secret Saus and Truffle Ketchup. We also spotted complimentary Housemade Hot Saus, so we got that as well. They offer 15 plus unique sauces! They were really good and tasty, went perfectly with the fries.The ""Regular"" sized fries were pretty big, enough to share! Potatoes were fried perfectly, crunchy exterior and soft and potato-y inside. Definitely reminded me of the real Belgian fries that I had in Belgium. Staffs were courteous and nice, efficient and quick. The fries are made to order so they are fresh and hot! It was really nice, we loved every bite of the twice-fried potatoes with addictive sauces.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"5,"I love Saus. I am probably a fry connoisseur at this point, no joke, and these fries are amazing. There are an overwhelming amount of sauces here, I usually get truffle ketchup or the chipotle mayo. I tried their waffle sundae which comes with a scoop of ice cream and some sauce drizzled over, and it was great! This is defintely a treat yourself type of place, located super close off the haymarket t stop, theres no reason you shouldn't go here!!",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"3,"*** 4/2018 lunch ***Consider it a lunch deal, consider it a Happy Hour of sorts, just consider it - Weekdays thru 3pm Sides are $1 when added to a sando (aka Sandwich) at Saus.Despite the normal side fries price of $2.50, those may be the best portion for a side as their $4 slaws (scallion or apple cabbage) come in those little plastic cups.We tried the scallion slaw, which was okay, but nothing special.Regular Poutine $6.75 (vs. $8.50 for Big) with classic gravy was pretty good. Â But I ended up preferring the Crispy Chicken Sandwich $8.50 (beer brined chicken breast and scallion slaw and dill pickles and Saus mayo on a central bakery bun) over the Veggie Burger $8.50 (farro, fava beans, corn, kale patty and dill pickles and scallion slaw and sliced tomato and cheddar and swapped for the avo-goddess sauce on a central bakery bun) because the flavors weren't as strong and the patty gave me no resistance such as a meat based burger might.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"We came here after a night of drinking and their fries are such amazing drunk food! I have tried one of their sandwiches but it wasn't memorable. I'd recommend this place just for their fries and poutine!It is a small place with limited seating so be prepared to stand and eat at one of the counters (if there is even room there).POUTINE w/ MISO-MUSHROOM GRAVY - I was skeptical about getting a vegetarian gravy, but I was curious and wanted to try it out. It is so good and smells so heavenly!! It is a very strong mushroom smell ( not in a bad way), but when you taste it, it is very light. I got a small and it is shareable between 2 people. Could definitely finish one by myself though because I love fries.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"3,"What do you do when it's cold, rainy and you just want to get your grub on? Order in. That's exactly what I did!So on my first night in Boston, I was looking up reviews and found a healthy 4 stars for this, so I thought - NICE, let's see what you're made of! Order was easy to put through and arrived within the estimated time, which was great. However, those were the only factors I was impressed with.The poutine was not good. The gravy was way too salty! I had to sip water after every bite. There's no way people can find it tasty and if so, they're well on their way to a heart attack!The herb-roasted chicken sandwich wasn't bad but I personally wasn't a fan. The chicken was cold, which I'm assuming was on purpose. Apples in the slaw was an interesting that I appreciated.Lastly, the greens were good, but how difficult is it to mess up a simple salad? Although, I enjoyed the the parsley vinaigrette.I really wanted to like it but I did not understand the hype surrounding this place.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,Quick service and ordered the mushroom poutine from the late night menu. Disappointed that it wasn't a full service menu but the food was still good.Late menu:- Regular fries $7 - poutine (mushroom or gravy) $8.50- fried chicken sandwich $10,Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Great concept, decent execution. I came in for lunch and the place was packed. The space is a bit cramped, but service is quick enough that it's not a problem. I ordered the poutine with classic gravy and pork belly, along with a can of Downeast Cider. Feeling hungry, I decided to order the ""big"" version, and oh boy was it big. Now, I have a talent for putting away food (and the body to prove it), but I had to struggle to fit the whole thing in my stomach. The struggle was well worth it though. The fries were salty but delicious, and the gravy and cheese curds paired very well together. For the fries that weren't drenched in gravy, I tried their house-made ketchup, which was phenomenal! It was perfectly balanced, and I swear I tasted a hint of maple. The only reason I held back a star was the pork belly; it was a tad dry, hard to cut, and didn't add anything to the dish.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Beer, sandwiches, fries. It's perfect. Other than they're not open too late, which is when you really want fries.Over a dozen different sauces for your fries here. From regular ketchup (which is free) to spicy ketchup or curry ketchup or mayo and stuff with chipotle and habaneros and all sorts. Too many to list but not too many to enjoy.We stopped for lunch. I chose the crispy chicken sandwich, which was excellent. A thick chicken breast, covered in batter and fried up nicely, served on a bun with cabbage and pickles. Yummy and very hot.With it, I ordered a ""regular"" size of fries. Hand cut and a little random, which is nice. Some done light, some done a bit more. Tasty with the salt. And then, two dipping sauces. The chipotle mayo (yum!) and the buffalo sauce (spicy!). Excellent.It's not a very fancy place. Not at all. But it's yummy and that's what matters.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"5,"My daughter has been hyping this spot up for the last 9 months, even having me fund ""Saus night"" for her. So on our most recent visit to bean town, we took a late night visit (on a Friday). Wisely, we didn't drive as parking is a nightmare in that part of town. As on the wall, in the words of Gucci mane, you gotta have SausModest crowd but no wait for a table nor to order. We did a BIG poutine, and shared it, I honestly wish I had done a solo portion (I'm greedy & don't like to share, even with loved ones). Â We got the classic gravy w cheese curds, Sambal & bacon bits. It was PHENOMINAL!! The Sambal (Asian spice) was toasted crisp but had an awesome Â bite. The bacon bits and cheese curds have a nice change of texture and gooeyness.

In a nutshell Â for Saus",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"5,Amazing!! Small cute atmosphere. The fried chicken sandwich was thin and crispy and perfect. The French fries were amazing and the sauces were to die for!!!,Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"The food: the crispy chicken sandwich is delicious but can be kind of bland on occasion. Mix it up with one of their several dipping sauces and you got yourself a nice chicken sandwich. Their fries are also pretty tasty and they have a nice selection of beer. Stay away from the salad with herb roasted chicken, even though the greens are fresh the chicken itself didn't taste that good. Atmosphere: a small venue with nice music and Tintin comics adorning the walls. Get yourself some Saus!",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"I actually went to Belgium once and didn't eat a lot of fries and that has haunted me forever. My only real exposure to Belgian fries was at Pomme Frites in NYC and I've loved them ever since.This place is pretty small and I can see it being a real hassle to get seats when it's crowded. But the staff was very friendly and patient with my indecisiveness at their extensive sauce menu. We got the poutine with kimchi. The poutine itself was okay, the gravy just didn't do it for me. The kimchi didn't really add much to the poutine either. I don't know if I'd get it again, but if I did I definitely wouldn't add on the kimchi.We also got a regular order of fries and a bunch of sauces and it ended up being so good I wish I got the large order instead. My favorites were the truffle ketchup (crazy amount of truffle flavor), and the spicy sambal. The roasted garlic and secret saus were both good but I was just way more impressed with the other two. I'll definitely be back to work my way through the sauces.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Pretty decent fries (pictures is the petite size). They have a variety of sauces that you can buy along with the 3 complimentary sauces including ketchup and hot sauce. The fries were made to order so they were nice and hot. They were lightly salted. I got the roasted garlic, smokey chipotle and the cheddar ale cheese sauce. They all lived up to their names. My favorite had to be the chipotle. If you're craving fries this is definitely the place to go!",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"3,"Narrow restaurant and when busy, can be difficult to find seating. If the weather is nice and there isn't seating available, I'd recommend just eating it outside (though may be difficult if getting fries with dipping sauces.)The fries by themselves are very good. I actually recommend getting a large order with dipping sauces ($0.75/sauce or $10 for all). The poutine was okay. Cheese curds and gravy were flavorless and in the end just made the fries soggy.The crispy chicken sandwich was also real good! The slaw on the sandwich adds a nice crunch. They use their house-made mayo as a spread and it's delicious on their bun.Staff was friendly and patient, it's a cool place to stop by for a casual lunch.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,Good portion for good food. The fries were perfectly cooked. The sauces and cheese curds are delicious. My only complaint was there isnt enough fresh opinions. The poutine is a heavy and greasy dish. Im not a fan of vegetables and like greasy food. But sometimes too much grease isnt a good thing. I ordered the scallions and crispy schallots to lighten the dish. Turn out crispy shallots is fried shallots. The whole dish was way too greasy. Also the pork belly is super delicious on its own but way too heavy for this also. Im thinking the pork carnitas would be better. The spicy pork sauce is flavorful but not spicy. The hot sauce on the table is actually spicy and cut the grease very well.,Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"2,Pretty mediocre poutine. Frik was good but not worth 9 bucks. Waffle was pretty mediocre too and don't forget its only a quarter of a waffle. In all this place is not what it used to be. Giving it 2 stars because of the Frik else would be 1.,Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Standing room only, but now I know why. For my first visit I chose the Veggie Burger. I love pickles and this one has a bottom layer of them. I don't normally like orange cheeses but this cheese was mild and had very little taste next to the other, more flavorful ingredients. It is one of the better veggie burgers I have had. I noticed that some sandwiches can be made into salads. That might have been a great option.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"5,"While vacationing in Boston this summer, I stopped by this historic place at the recommendation of a Bostonian. The wait for a table was over an hour so I decided to order a clam chowder to go. While waiting, the front counter host was nice, answered all my tourist questions and guided me towards the famous ""Kennedy Booth."" As far as my clam chowder soup, I was amazing! It came with warm corn bread and butter which I did not expect. I happily sat and ate my clam chowder on a bench, in the rain.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"1,"I decided to go and check out this place even after reading the reviews. My motto is ""everything isn't for everybody"" so the reviews were mixed I decided to give a try. The place was recommend to me by a friend who knows I love history and after telling me that this is the oldest continuous running restaurant in the entire USA how could I not go. Also I thought; of its good enough for John F Kennedy , it's good enough for me. The outside is beautiful and it's in a really cute part of town. So a star for that. Inside it smells Â like how one would Imagine the oldest fish restaurant would smell like; fishy.  I could spend hours there reading all the write ups on the wall and all the patches from many municipalities from around the US, I noticed there were many from SoCal. I had read they open until late, however the kitchen closes earlier so I would call ahead of time. Â Only bar sitting and clam chowder after 10:00pm. So we ordered a beer. The beer had a fishy taste, I suspect it was the cup, which is understandable. On our way to wash our hands we noticed more cool memorabilia on the walls which was cool to look at and take photos. There was something about the hair and filthy Â bathroom that made me rethink my purchase of clam chowder (the only thing available after 10:00p) I mean was someone getting manscaped in there? There was no soap in the dispenser or it wasn't working. Â While I chatted with my buddy waiting on the chowder he commented to me how dusty the bar looked, the bottles were dusty and the touch screen on the register was greasy looking, it was dirty. Suddenly I started to notice that the entire place needed some TLC and some cleaning, it wasn't patina there were crumbs and other unidentifiable particles. Perhaps this is the restaurants charm? It's not for me. I think the outside of the building is beautiful and the history of the place makes it a good place for pictures and something on the bucket list, but I don't think I could recommend dining here. It feels too risky. Â  I guess for such a historic place I was expecting the staff to take a little more pride in keeping the place clean. Â I mean it's the oldest running restaurant in the US it has to be somebodies cup of tea, it was not my cup of tea.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"2,"Didn't have a pleasant experience. Meghan (a very kind and friendly lady) at the reception was the best part of the experience. Don't sit in the back of the second floor; it's so small that all the conversations make the atmosphere very loud. We had to move because we couldn't hear ourselves.The waitress (she didn't say her name) forgot my guest's baked beans, and they rarely came by our table unless we called them over. When she refilled my tea, she stuck her finger in the glass as she held it. From watching the other waiters, we realized it was just our waiter, so you'll most likely get good service here.Don't order the American Bouillabaisse! The cod wasn't deboned, the broth was red water, and they mix in steamers, which are known for being sandy, plus they gave the broth a bad aftertaste. The mussels were cooked well, but the scallops were a bit rubbery (scallops are difficult to cook, so I expected it anyways), and the lobster was not cut well in half. There were pieces of inner shell mixed with the lobster meat, and there was a small amount of body/tail meat left inside, as if some had been scooped out. Neither me or my guest found any of the lobster meat in the soup. The lobster meat was boiled well, though, and it was very tender.The price of the food was a major issue. Since almost all of the food included lobster, the given price was almost always ""market price."" Since our waitress was absent, we couldn't ask what the price was for today. As a recommendation, there should be some kind of average price range, or even a base price plus the market price ($17.99+market price, for example).Overall, I did not enjoy my time at the restaurant. The food was prepared poorly, the service was poor, and the atmosphere was loud. Oh, to avoid waiting an hour, make sure to get a reservation beforehand, otherwise you can wait in their adjacent bar, which was actually a pleasant experience for my party.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"One of the oldest restaurants in the country. Actually I think it might be the oldest. It's in a tourist trap location and I believe the food is better at other places but this place has so much history and I feel like it's really warm and cozy. Set down at the bar to have a drink before dinner where they were shucking oysters. Then went upstairs and had dinner. Really enjoyed the seafood Newburg. Although, the lobster was a little overcooked as where the scallops. But I really enjoyed the thick creamy sauce over rice. I was definitely full!!!",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"3,"7/18The oldest continuously running restaurant in America. Serving since 1826. Yes I felt like a tourist in a trap but I couldn't resist it. The narrow entry can be difficult to pass through with people coming and going. Once inside there is a gift shop to the left and raw bar seating to the right. We were seated promptly and our server was polite and attentive. Bread service was a hunk of corn bread with a wrapped square of butter underneath. It alone could be a meal. I didn't want to spoil my appetite so I didn't bother to eat it. I should have. Hubby ordered steamers to start. Our server showed him how to pinch the skin away, bath it in water to remove grit and dunk it in the butter. After watching, I'll admit that I got a bit nauseous. Hubby dove right in and loved them. I looked away. Not my thing. Hubby had lobster for his main. The presentation was dramatic and a little macabre. The lobsters face was placed in front of the butter as if it were drinking. Twist of the tail and let the cracking begin. I've had lobster loads of times but I just couldn't eat it this time around. Hubby, butter splatters on his shirt and happily munching away, was not put off by the little butter slurping face at all. I'm not usually squeamish but this day, I was. I ordered 1/2 dozen oysters. They were fairly small and only partially detached. I wasn't given an oyster fork so I had to use a regular one to detach them. Some were gritty. The cocktail sauce tasted like ketchup even after I added horseradish. It had a sweetness to it that was unappealing. Hubby for the win. He enjoyed his meal, hence the three stars. Mine not so much. 12/17Stumbled upon this place in search of libations before dinner! A must see wall that is 3D depicting all the stops along the Freedom Trail.

Â Legal's clam chowder is better imho though as it's too thick for me for the Union's. Â Good service, lots of seating and interesting inside.

Â I had the scrod and was admittedly disappointed with lack of seasoning for my own taste - but the fish was still cooked to perfection.They do not have Coke or Pepsi products - they have what I believe is a local cola (it was okay)My favorite thing here that we tried was their clam chowder, but the cornbread is damn good too!",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"5,Such a great doing experience!This is the oldest restaurant in the US and I can see why they have stuck around!The service was fantastic! When we checked in the hostess immediately helped us with our stroller & called ahead to our table to make sure there was a high chair. When we made it to our table (it's a LARGE restaurant) the high chair was there.We had multiple servers who were great & made some excellent beer and lobster roll suggestions. They were also really nice about the fact that we had a baby and played peek a boo with her.The good was delightful! The clam chowder was the best I've ever had! My husband loved his cold seafood platter & my lobster roll was great!Atmosphere was playful and vibe was friendly.Definitely pricey but worth it!,Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Have to say I fell in love with Boston and can't wait to go back. We had dinner at the Oyster House and it was everything I expected- from the hostess ""yeah, you'll have ""dinnah upstaahs hun"" to the delicious ""chowda "" and food. There's something unique sitting in a place this old and with so much character and history. Â The portions are good, well seasoned, fresh and tasty. Â  Service was great. Yeah, it was pricey but what do you expect- and I'd love to go again.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Great Oyster bar ambience with great service. Sat at the bar checking out how they shuck the oysters and clams. Pretty awesome bartender/oyster shucker, and cashier all in one! The old building is bursting with history and just Â enjoying a drink at the bar is enough to absorb and feel the history.Will definitely comeBack again.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"2,"This place is so overpriced and the food is not good. It's a tourist trap - we just wanted to try it out since it's the oldest restaurant. It's an interesting place in terms of its history, but other than that, it's not worth it. We had 2 Bloody Marys and 2 meals and the bill was $75. Rediculous. Our server was very brash and would just throw the plates on the table in front of us. It took her forever to even come and take our drink order when we first sat down. If you want to come here and check out the restaurant's history, I would sit at the bar and just order a drink. Food is so much better in other places in Boston.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"3,"The historical significance of the Union Oyster House is a big draw. I mean how many times do you get the chance to eat at the oldest restaurant in the United States and where historic figures like Daniel Webster ate? It was a neat experience from that perspective but it comes with a hefty price tag and I can't say the food was particularly stellar. We got oysters which were fine but the house made cocktail sauce had a weird funk that reminded me of the way my grandmother's house smelled. The cornbread was cold and pretty sweet which is not to my liking. The service was very good and they do have a beer brewed just for them by Sam Adams which was very good. On the whole, I'm glad we went but I wouldn't go back.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"2,Over priced tourist trap. We waited over an hour for a table. Finally got to our table and service was slow. Food was average and priced very high. Small portions. Stand outside and take your pictures. Don't bother going in to eat!,Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Self proclaimed the oldest continuously running restaurant in America, this place definitely has character. You can hang out downstairs for the lightened menu or go upstairs for the chicken fingers. I mean don't, but if you must, they do have it. The oyster bar downstairs is part of the original bar. In fact, coasters serve double duty as balance adjusters so your plate doesn't slide right off. The two shuckers are super friendly and gel well together. Funny enough, I actually witnessed their dumb waiter breaking off the chain. Luckily no one was hurt. I started with the Sam Adams Colonial Ale. If you've never heard of it before, it's because they only serve it at this place. I don't traditionally like Sam Adams but this was quite tasty. I went with a cup of New England clam chowder (the white one) and some steamers. I can't think of a better semi light meal.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Took a recent family trip to Boston and went to the Union Oyster House on our first night. Â We wanted something close to Quincy Market, and this was a short block away. Â I made reservations a week earlier - good thing because the wait was over an hour for people walking in. Â No wait for us though! Â We were seated on the third floor - the place is crowded but not overly so. Â Old creaky wood stairs & floor, small rooms, the history comes through. Â Food: The appetizers were outstanding. Â We had perhaps the best clams casino I've ever had. Â The calamari was good - not the best we had in Boston (hello Legal Seafood) - but still very satisfactory. Â My clam chowder was delicious. Â Corn bread was just like I like it, a little on the sweet side. Â Kid's menu was sufficient, and my kid ate his entire hot dog, grill marks and all. Â The only downfall was my husband's rubbery, bland scallops. Â Those were a huge letdown.Service was good, our server was pleasant and attentive.Overall, this was a good family restaurant that made all three of us happy.

Only wish they had longer hours!,Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"2,Got the chorizo breakfast sandwich because all the yelp reviews said that's the best...hmmm....1. Good music while you wait2. Sandwich was nothing to talk about and dry 3. Staff was like going to a Chinese take out...DON'T waste your calories. NOT WORTH IT!,Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"2,"Rare yelp letdown. I'll start with 3 positives. 1) They sell a bottled cane cola that is fantastic. 2) they were open. 3) I could charge my iPhone. That's it. Overpriced. Underwhelming. Bland food. Burger was seriously underwhelming. Average at best. Soggy roll. Overwhelming amount of toppings that had no magic. (I ordered the man cave).They managed to check off every one of my big pet peeves. - only one size of fries. This would be forgivable if the fries were creatively prepared. Â They were not. Just typical fast food frozen bland fries unworthy of $4. - don't make me predict your service. I hate when takeout places make you tip at ordering. Â How am I to know how you will do? A tip is what I reward you with for great service. And the default lowest amount was 15%. Service was mediocre and they were out of things. - if you're a restaurant, have a restroom. Duh. After walking around Boston chances are you want to wash your hands before eating handheld goods like a burger and fries. Just a big letdown. Doesn't happen often. Took an Uber from south station since the reviews and photos were so enticing. At least I could charge my phone. But I probably used that juice to write this crummy review. $20 for a basic fast food burger, fries and soda? Nah.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"3,"I got the man cave burger because everyone on yelp was raving about it but to be honest, it wasn't THAT good. I'd give it like a 6/10. Maybe it's cause I got a turkey patty instead of the beef patty. Regardless - i think I'm open to come back and try something else. It seemed really nice and quaint with little seating, so plan ahead!",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Inexpensive burger lunch at Wheelhouse today. There's nothing fancy about this joint and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's small, it has a few stools around the counters along the walls and they have a tiny kitchen that you can see into. Not a lot.My colleague and I ordered burgers. I chose the pimento cheese which came with a big pile of crispy bacon and thin-sliced pickles. A double beef patty, it was super juicy and very delicious. A little messy but awesome.We shared a basket of fries, which apparently only come in the size of ""massive"" because there were still leftovers after two growing boys dug into them.They do have a wifi but we didn't spend enough time here to sign on. Just yummy burgers and fries and then back to work.They have ""alternative"" burgers including chicken, black bean, turkey and such. A cooler with some sodas and juices, too.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"5,"The cutest mom and pop breakfast place ever. So glad I found it.

Will definitely be back :)",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Good, meaty burger for a decent price!I had the Man Cave and the Wheelhouse burger. The Wheelhouse was okay (didn't like the sauce too much), but I enjoyed the man cave. It was filled with bacon and drenched in cheese, and the patties were moist and very thick (they don't skimp round here). The burgers ranged between $8-10, and they are worth what you get. Overall, great little place to grab a quick bite to eat!",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Initially i was worried that this place is overhyped but it wasn't! We got Mancave, Fun Guy and Cali. I cannot pick which was my favorite burger because they were EQUALLY AMAZING! I wouldn't recommend getting an extra patty because each burger is perfectly balanced with the amount of sauce and cheese. Throwing in another patty would ruin the proportion (in my opinion). I'm definitely coming back again... !! Tips: order online! The only minus point is the wait but you can order online to skip the wait",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"4,"These guys make a pretty tasty burger. Â The quality is definitely there, but not the old condiments like lettuce and tomato. The first time I came here, I was caught up in the hype and a little bit disappointed. Â Their burgers are a little on the smaller side, Â and I just didn't feel satisfied. On the second time around, I told them to add a third patty. Now, it is perfect. Didn't feel too full or hungry with a side of fries. The Chuck Norris is pretty good, and filled with flavor. It gets busy at lunch, Â so you should order online or be very patient.One thing I applaud them for is wrapping everything in wax paper. I've had experiences with Five guys where the grease and juices from a burger would disintegrate the paper bag and cause my fries and burger to be all over the street.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Tried the breakfast burger. I'm a pretty big burger fan, but this was a bit too much for me for breakfast. Actually comes with TWO sizeable patties, egg, and quite a bit of cheese. It did seem like a ""normal"" burger to me though... not sure what makes it a breakfast burger (apart from being served at bfast). In any case, it was fairly tasty, although the patties were a little on the burnt side. Price is reasonable.I'd return, but will probably stick to the other breakfast options.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Loved this place, the nola was amazeballs, we also had the rice, definitely a keeper.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Great Burgers and the fries were definitely shareable but i loved them, so crispy and perfectly seasoned!!!!",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"4,I work on broad street so I walk by this restaurant all the time. Yesterday I took the plunge and decided to eat here and..... why has it taken me this long?! I had the chuck Norris burger and it melted in my mouth. It was so delicious! I also had a side of fries which at $4 I thought was a little pricey but then I saw the portion and it's definitely a steal. The fries were super crispy and Â salted to perfection. I will absolutely be back!,Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"5,"When I ate the sandwich, I knew right away that it was worth a 5 star. I got the Nola, a spicy creole sandwich with Andouille sausage, egg, and cheese Â I was a jolly gal. It's not too spicy and probably more on the mild side. Sausage was juicy and flavorful. I loved the buns with the creole sauce. There wasn't an overwhelming amount, thank god. Cheese was my favorite part because they give you a massive amount but not too much to the point where it overpowers the other flavors.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"3,"We stopped in for breakfast sandwiches. They were ok. I had ham/egg/cheese which came on a English muffin. Instead of slices of ham, there was a chuck of ham which made it annoying to eat. My hubs had the one with spicy sausage that he enjoyed.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"4,"I ordered the classic breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese with the maple cream. Â I would highly recommend the maple cream! Â It is not cream but whipped maple syrup and adds the perfect flavor to the sandwich. Â My only complaint about the sandwich is that I wish it were bigger! Â I could have kept eating (even though it was perfectly filling).The coffee flavors look interesting and I'd like to try them, though I wish there were more of a variety because I'm not too interested in what they're offering right now. Â I'll be back in the summer to test it out!",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"4,Happy happy find near the Hilton. They are closed on the weekends so get ready to wait with the local workers in denim and silk alike. The staff was Boston-tough fun. The menu simple but awesome.

I would have that thing shipped to me it was soooo good.,Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"4,Went here for lunch because the reviews were really positive. This place doesn't disappoint!!!

This place is purpose-built to provide quality sammies and burgers with some added sides and coffee. They know what they do well and stick to it. #wheelhouseI had the Traditional breakfast sammie, sausage, with maple cream and a side of smash fries with spicy creole sauce. Everything was well-prepared, flavors were spot on, and ingredients fresh. Didn't see the ants someone else mentioned but, if I did? Â It's an old building in an older city and, hey, free protein! :-)Didn't get the flavored iced coffee but nearly everyone else in the continuous flow of people did.

The line wasn't too bad on the 4th of July. We highly recommend Maine Lobster Roll. But Boston Chowda was a so-so. Street parking was totally impossible. Garage parking charged $9 every 20 minutes up to $40 maximum.,Boston Chowda,"1 Faneuil Hall Market Pl Boston, MA 02109"1,"Granted it was the day before 4th of July and Quincy Market was packed full of Chinese tourists and also by the rave reviews, I had thought the verbiage that lobster is good anywhere in Maine was true. There are two main queues inside the tightly packed market. Hordes of tourists crowded at the registers not sure what to order. The owner was pushy and belligerent in his acknowledgement of each customer and practically shouting at you to get the pre-set special of lobster roll, chowder bread bowl and drink. We managed to get through the queue and quickly ordered our hot lobster roll and small bowl of chowder, no bread bowl. Our to-go food arrived quickly and we ate outside in the public seating area. Immediately upon picking up the roll I noticed the sitting seafood smell and also realized my hot roll was not hot at all. Rather the roll was toasted and got cold and the lobster was room temperature and rubbery. The chowder saved the meal though not very much clams in the thin soup base. Flavor profile of chowder was all there, not much to chew on except a stray piece of clam and copious potatoes. Added the oyster crackers in the end for some semblance of texture. All in all, the rolls here were the least memorable during our time here in Boston. I'd recommend you venture away from Quincy Market for a hot roll elsewhere, such as Neptune's up the way - theirs was fresh, juicy and hot!",Boston Chowda,"1 Faneuil Hall Market Pl Boston, MA 02109"4,"WHAT TO TRY???The lobster roll. The Boston chowder. This place is located inside Faneuil hall. There's always a line here so if you see a line, you're mostly at the right place. They're known for their lobster roll. I like their roll because it's served hot in butter. The bun was crispy on the outside. The clam chowder was alright though. Nothing that special but if it's your first time in boston, make sure you try the chowder. The lobster roll can come as a combo that comes with a small chowder and a soft drink. Quite a deal if you take advantage of it for a nice lunch. LAST TIP?!You can also have the clam chowder served in a sourbread bowl if you haven't tried it already. I normally can't finish the bread bowl though, but you can definitely feed the birds with the left over bread if you like. I usually just get the regular chowder without the bread though.",Boston Chowda,"1 Faneuil Hall Market Pl Boston, MA 02109"4,"Boston Chowda is the number one stop inside Quincy Market. Almost everyone comes here with two expectations - clam chowder and lobster roll. Since I just had lobster roll from Neptune Oyster less than 4 hours ago and still felt pretty full, I only ordered a small clam chowder. You can also order hot buttered lobster roll & clam chowder combo if you are really hungry. In addition they got other soup options like Rockport Lobster Bisque, Paul Revere Chili, Plymouth Corn Chowder, Manhattan Clam Chowder, and Mother's Chicken Vegetable Soup. ***New England Clam Chowder (small cup, $4.99): Creamy soup with a good oyster-to-potato ratio. Not exactly the best clam chowder I have had, but still pretty good.***I don't know whether their clam chowders are actually worth the hype, but I would still give this popular food stand a try!",Boston Chowda,"1 Faneuil Hall Market Pl Boston, MA 02109"4,"I may not be able to pronounce chowda like a native Bostonian, but I can definitely appreciate one!Boston Chowda is located in the Quincy Market, specifically in Faneuil Hall. It took me a while to find this place, but the biggest giveaway is the long line up especially on weekends. It can be a bit of a wait depending on how busy it is, but the staff is quick and efficient.The New England Clam Chowder is famous for good reason. Deliciously creamy with a good amount of clams and potatoes - my only regret was not getting it in the bread bowl! It was probably the best chowder I've ever had. I also got the Hot Buttered Maine Lobster Roll which I wasn't as pleased with. They give you a lot of lobster meat. If you're someone who likes simplicity, you may be a fan but I found it a bit bland for my liking as there wasn't much else going on other than bread and lobster.The perks of this place are food is piping hot, they have delicious chowder, and they don't skimp out on their portions. However, it is a bit on the pricier side, there can be a long line up depending on the time, and there is almost no empty seats in this busy cafeteria.",Boston Chowda,"1 Faneuil Hall Market Pl Boston, MA 02109"4,Lobster roll was juicy and delicious.

The one thing that set this place apart,was their presentation on their food. There was a big sign,Best Chowder in Town. Then just below, Manager Special with a picture.

They didn't use a lot of mayo like most lobster rolls, so it wasn't masked by sauce. The warm brioche bun was the icing on the cake.

The lobster portion was generous and had nice texture and flavor. I got full from eating this! The squirt of lemon on top went well.

Besides being homey and a little snug inside, there are community tables right outside the building under the plastic cover. Around this time it's a bit chilly to sit out there but good news my friends, they'll warm these pies up for you if you plan to eat here. And the pies? I think we went here when they had an off day. Buffalo Chicken Mac N' Cheese Pie (Monthly Specials)- Didn't have that tang or kick from the buffalo sauce. It had an odd cheesy texture and was lacking flavor. The crust was the highlight of this pie, flaky goodness.Beef Stew Pie- We were looking forward to this in particular but surprisingly the meat tasted like it had no seasoning. Not sure if it was sitting under the lamp too long but everything basically evaporated and was completely dried out.Potato Wedges- The one item on the menu that didn't disappoint. Extra crispy potatoes with sweet and spicy chili sauce drizzled all over. Overall Service: It was stale. They barely said anything to us, nothing beyond the money transaction and food pick up.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"1,"Just had the most upsetting experience at KO. I had ordered a pie but the buzzer never buzzed. I went in and asked if it was ready and the owner brought the pie out of the back. I felt the top and it wasn't hot so I said something. The owner assured me it was hot and I was like ""I just felt it - it doesn't feel hot"". He took the pie, turned it upside down and slammed it on the counter. The pieces flew everywhere, all over me. I was so shocked I cried. I kept repeating ""it didnt feel hot!"" I called my husband over and showed him my jacket, and he went to the owner and was like ""are you serious??"" The owner said ""whatever! I showed her it was hot and she got hysterical.""I had brought 12 people with me - all my neighbors in East Boston and they had to see me cry in front of KO Pies manager. It makes me so sad to lose this beautiful restaurant- I never want to go back here and I never want any customer to be treated this way.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"4,"What a calm, cool and chill place to grab dinner. As many others, we were in town to visit the cider house next door. We came here based on the many Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. At first it looked a bit overwhelming, but it's quite a fine-tuned machine. You order at the counter. There are signs everywhere telling you where things are and where you can find things. It's really helpful. We ordered the classic meat pie and the special of the month, which was Buffalo Chicken Mac 'n Cheese. We were not disappointed. I must say, I wish we jazzed up our order a bit based on what was coming out of the kitchen. We kept it pretty basic. The pies were already made and waiting for us in a hot space, bonus! We didn't have to wait for the meal to be ready. I wish we ordered the potato wedges! Both pies were really delicious. Our meal of two pies cost $15. I don't think you can beat that. In hindsight, we should have vamped up our order. The pies are relatively small, so they weren't that filling. You can sit (season pending) at their picnic tables under the awning. They also have a pretty sweet outdoor area that offers some backyard games and seating. This is really cool place that you don't get to experience often. It's definitely worth it.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"5,Australian comfort food. Just as good as American confort food. Try a floater with any pie; they're all fantastic.Great spot in the summer.

Â I had pie of the month (chicken siracha) and it was good. Â Their custom beer by Harpoon is tasty. Â I also tried a sausage roll. Â Not bad! Â Unfortunately, there is no waitstaff (counter service only) and it's in the middle of no where in East Boston.Overall, I'm not sure this place lived up to the hype.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"4,"Got the lamb pie all the way and shared it with a friend. Really happy to have tried it, and great place to drop by after checking out the ICA warehouse nearby.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"5,Got a pie to go and brought it down to the park to watch the sunset on a date.. Very quick and friendly service and tasty lamb shank pie! Highly recommend for a laid back dinner date.,KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"1,"The food is ok. The owner, however, is an extremely sensitive, tiny-statured, and generally, delicate individual who, if you're unfortunate enough to encounter, may throw an epic tantrum over the slightest perception of offense. Oddly enough, he seems to exhibit some self-control over his case of the angries. He limits his ""threatening"" *snorts* behavior towards mainly his women customers and small children. So...... if you have a hankering to gobble up a mediocre, Aussie-style pie whilst taking a gamble upon being ""assaulted"" by a very short (did I forget to mention that he's petit?), very irritable man-baby, then this is absolutely the place for you.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"3,"Food: I never had a pie of this type before. The idea reminded me of a chicken pot pie, which I never had before as well. Although I did not have a prior experience to compare this experience to, I thought the pie was okay. There were pies that had some type of sauce on top but I Â apparently got one that did not and I think that made a difference. The pie tasted a bit dry.Cost: The pie was about the size of a palm. On the expensive side for how much you are getting. Worth an experience if you never had one of these before.Environment: Cozy would be a word I would use to describe the place. Getting your order in is a bit difficult because space was small but the eating area is nice and open with a couple picnic table styles to sit on.Service: There wasn't much service except putting your order in. Depending on what you ordered, it looked like the pies were made and kept in a warmer and as soon as you ordered they would take it out and give it to you.Uniqueness: I would consider this experience unique because I've never had anything like this before. Something I would recommend to try at least once.Came to visit the cider house next door. Since we were a little early and hungry, the group I went with wanted to grab something to eat and the only restaurant close by was this place. Not my first choice to go to but the convenience was nice.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"4,We were waiting for a friend to land so we looked for the closest place to grab a quick bite and drink and found KO Pies. This place is seriously in the middle of a shipyard and there isn't much near by except for Downeast which is a cider brewery. Had the classic beef pie and a can of cider. Both were amazing! Even went next door to Downeast to get a six pack of ciders to take home. The only reason they aren't getting five stars is because of the location. But honestly it's worth giving it a try if you're trying to kill time before going to the airport!,KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"2,"Got seriously food poisoned here. Actually a few of us did. It can happen anywhere but still, when you're dealing in frozen pies, there should be a bit more assurance that what you eat in the restaurant is somehow fresh and untainted.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"4,"After a day, literally a day full of visiting breweries we needed something for dinner. Our last stop was Down East Cider which is literally feet from KO Pies so we decided to have some Australian in Boston (said no one ever). The place was really busy and not just from the Down East crowd, KO seems to have a local reputation for good quality inexpensive food. We decided to each get a meat pie with a couple dishes to share. They were out of the seafood pie my girlfriend wanted but she settled on a classic beef and cheese (think cheeseburger). I had the Jamaican jerk chicken with pineapple sauce which was OK but there was so much crust and it needed moisture from hot sauce and the side pineapple sauce to help me get it down. The shared dishes we got were their famous fries, served with two dipping sauces and the spicy wings served with an amazing tangy sauce. The fries were good, steak cut and made for dipping. The wings were better, I personally ate about 6 of them myself. The wings aren't spicy themselves but are served with fresh cut peppers that pair really well. The sauce was actually the highlight! I could have that tangy sauce with anything and it helped me get down some of the pie crust. KO pies has good inexpensive food for everyone. They served a couple different beers and are in a cool location away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The pie I had was OK but the wings and fries bump it up a start for me. If you want to try something different instead of the lobster roll or fried oysters, try out some Australian meat pies.",KO Pies At the Shipyard,"256 Marginal St Bldg 16 Boston, MA 02128"5,"Great vibe, excellent service, fantastic food - what is not to love about Sportello! :-)We visit a few times a year and have been coming for some time now - it never disappoints... definitely a highly recommend and we look forward to coming back...",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"3,"This was my first time here. I was super excited because I've heard so many positive things about this place but when I came in last night, I guess I was a little disappointed. Food- first of all the food was the best part. Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS. The homemade pasta was what drew me into the place at first anyways. Environment- the restaurant was smaller than I thought it would be. It was also very loud; it was hard to hear what my table mates were saying. I felt like I had to shout to be heard. The table we were seated at was kind of banged up-- it was chipped in places and just looked sad and out of place for such a nice restaurant. The food is so good and expensive-- why was the decor just...lacking?Service- I'm going to preface this with this: I am also a server. I've worked in restaurants for about 1.5 years. I know how hard this job is, and the staff was working super hard. I am not super picky with the service I receive, but the service here still left much to be desired. The restaurant was quite busy, but our server just seemed out of it. She didn't interact with us much. Didn't even give us her name, or any introduction for that matter. I didn't know if we were supposed to request bread, but none was brought to us despite it being brought to other tables around us also in this server's section. We had to request bread. Also, I requested extra cheese for my pasta dish, and by the time the cheese got to us, I had already eaten most of the pasta, and forgotten about the cheese entirely. I'm sure she was busy but it still dampened the experience for me. Overall- probably would come back, but not planning to anytime soon. I don't think the whole experience was worth the $160 price tag for 3 people.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"4,"I'm so torn! My husband and I ADORE Sportello and have been coming for years! When out-of-towners visit, we always bring them here if we can snag a reservation. It's the home of my favorite pasta in the city! I enjoy the simple, open atmosphere and the big windows. Management (Mr. Moriarty) was gracious and wonderfully accommodating on one particular evening which keeps us coming back. However, multiple times, we've been served one particular waitress who has really dampened our dining experience. I'm definitely not one to expect too much or demand over-the-top service; I humbly say that I can be gracious to understand that people are people and people have good days and bad days. I appreciate great service, but am happy to let things slide as well. However, as we have gotten this waitress multiple times, I want to say that I've given her the benefit-of-the-doubt of having an off day here-and-there. Every time we've been served by her, she just doesn't seem happy to be there. I've never seen her smile while engaging with customers or otherwise. Her interactions with us have been short and minimal. We've always felt a little rushed. It's just overall dampened the mood of the meal. My husband is even more generous in terms of service expectations than I am, and even he has mentioned to me that this waitress has muddied our experiences at Sportello. I hope that if this waitress is unhappy, she finds happiness doing something she loves! Sportello is such a great concept in the city of Boston that I just hope the people they bring to their team can really get behind the dream and keep it the gem that it is!",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,"We had their spicy tomato soup, tagliatelle, and strozzapreti. Everything was flavorful and nicely presented. I also had their Italian greyhound and it went very well with the meal. Parking isn't easy in this neighborhood.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"3,"Food - 3.5-4 stars*Chickory salad - do not recommend. Â This is basically just plain butter lettuce with very vinegary pears. Â Not too special of a salad.*Warm bread - pretty good. Â We had two orders of this. Â Four half-slices of a baguette come in this order. Â The bread has oil on it, and is served with delicious olive oil. Â The first order of the bread was pretty hard, but the second was much softer. Â The flour is flown in from Sicily, which is supposed to give the bread a softer, spongier texture. *Strascinati (burgundy snails, opal basil pesto, toasted walnut) - delicious! Â You could tell the pasta was made right on the spot. Â It took a little while to come out, but it was definitely worth the wait. Â I greatly enjoyed this dish. Â The flavor profiles of all the ingredients complimented each other greatly, and I was pleased that this dish was not served in a cream-based sauce. *Tagliatelle - definitely order this with the bolognese sauce (it's a famous sauce!). Â If you do not eat meat or do not like bolognese, opt for a different dish. Â The portion is smaller than the Strascinati. Â The Warm Octopus Salad came highly recommended by our knowledgeable server, Katie (though we did not order it tonight).Blood Orange Sorbetti is made in-house and is very good. Â It's light, refreshing, and a nice way to end the meal. Â The cannoli also came highly recommended to us, but we wanted to opt for something lighter after the two orders of bread and pasta!Ambiance - 2 starsThe majority of the seating is counter seating. Â This gives the experience a much more casual vibe. Â The decor is quite plain, and the noise level is moderate. Â Some of the seats are close to the kitchen/cooking area, which is centrally located in the restaurant. Â That can be a cool place to sit, but overall, the ambiance was pretty blasÃ©.Service - 5 starsOur server, Katie, rocked! Â She was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and was very welcoming to us. Â It really showed that she wanted our first experience at the restaurant to be a positive, memorable one.Value - 3 starsYou're paying $26-29 per pasta plate. Â The food is quality, but that's definitely on the more expensive end for pasta, and most of the dishes don't use expensive ingredients. Â Overall - 3.5 stars",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"4,"I was very excited to try this restaurant as I had heard such good things. I came with a group of 6 last week with reservations and we were seated immediately. We were planning to go for the restaurant week menu (3 courses for $38 - FYI these plates are smaller than a la carte), but had a great waitress and ended up going with the 3 course family style option for $55/person (yes we got upsold). But at least with this option, we could choose whichever dish we wanted. Here's what we got:Octopus salad: generous amount of octopus, warm and cooked perfectlyChicory salad: good portion but wasn't a fan of the tasteLocal cod: ok, not particularly memorablePork chops: ok, not the juiciest chop i""ve hadTagliatelle: EXCELLENT, best entree of the night. Sauce was delicious, i kept eating it even after the pasta was gone. Potato gnocchi: some of the best gnocchi I have ever tasted. They melt in your mouth like little nuggets of mashed potatoes. Not chewy at all unlike most other gnocchi. Sauce was ok. I appreciated the chunks of lobster it came withWe got 2 bottles of red wine to share - both were ok. Our total bill came $91/person with tip. WoofOverall, the food was decent but expensive. I would stick with their pastas because those were the gems of the night. Service is excellent.TIP: When you get here, ask the waiter/waitress to put your name down for the waitlist for DRINK next door. That way when you're done with dinner, you can head for after-dinner drinks with no wait",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,"Came here for lunch with the foodie bestie yesterday! It was both of our first times here and I am so happy we chose this place.The decor is very sleek and modern but not so uppity (still casual but very nice) It was an open kitchen and I liked that. The service was great, our server was knowledgeable and friendly. We ordered the octopus app and 2 pasta dishes to split. (braised rabbit dish and the ramp tortellini) I love how fresh the pasta was! Very tasty, I especially liked the tortellini dish! The wine was good, but since when do I complain about anything alcoholic? LOL We went around 130 so it was pretty empty, probably because the lunch rush was already gone. Would definitely come back again!",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,Loved this place!!Bread to start came with olive oil brushed on it and was super soft and fluffy. Pasta was 10/10. Portions are hearty and very filling. Was satisfied with just the pasta and bread. Â Only catch was not many of the pasta dishes could be altered.,Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,"I've been going to Sportello for years and it's incredibly awesome and consistent. The service is always top-notch, friendly, and helpful. Ethan is one of the best waiters in the area, extremely funny yet also incredibly professional. The food is stellar. I've yet to have a single bad meal at Sportello. All of the house-made pastas are incredible, although there's a special place in my heart for the Bolognese (usually with tagliatelle). The spicy tomato soup is also a staple of mine and I can't get enough of it. The house-made limoncello is also good and has a great kick to it. A word of warning: most of Sportello's seating is counter seating. It's fine for two or three people eating together. If you have more than that, they will seat you at an actual table by the windows if one is available, but the tables are not usually for small parties. If you don't like counter seating, you may not like it here.Sportello is a little out of the way in the Seaport, but there's always plenty of parking in the area (metered or in one of the parking lots). You can also pair your visit to Sportello with a visit to Drink (either before or after) for some great craft cocktails.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"4,"Sportello is a casual dinning spot in the Fort Point area and I have been coming here for years now. I've tried several dishes over the years, but my standby and absolute recommendation is the tagliatelle. The pasta is handmade. It is thin, but has a slight chew. Very soft and fresh and also resilient. The pasta is perfectly paired with the bolognese sauce. Ground meat is well incorporated into the creamy rich sauce. My guess is that it is a mix of beef/veal and pork, I didn't notice any lamb taste. Parmesan adds a nutty tang. Fried basil leaf on top is mostly for decoration. I would have actually preferred if the basil leaf was uncooked, as it was oily and didn't have much taste. But some fresh basil would add a nice nuance.  Another dish I've gotten before is the dorade. A whole grilled fish with a pistachio crust and mint dressing, topped with watercress. The last time I ordered this it was stuffed with some citrus and herbs. This time the fish was not stuffed with anything. The fish meat itself is not very tender or juicy, but it is soft and easy to tear apart with a fork. This is a great dish to share. Especially since the saltiness and heavily seasoned skin can become monotonous. The crispy charred skin, with pistachio and paprika crust is where all the flavor is happening. However, the only nuance comes from the mint dressing. But, the mint is not evenly distributed and the heavy paprika, salt and pepper needs something to balance it. I don't know if this was an off day for the way the dish was made, or if the recipe changed since my last visit. Again, this is a dish best shared and coupled with something else off the menu to act as a balancer.Despite my criticisms the tagliatelle is more than enough to keep me coming back to Sportello.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"4,"It's too bad about our waitress.... Â The food was fantastic, the atmosphere was great, was a really nice evening apart from the experience dealing with our waitress (Megan L). Â She was completely emotionless, wasn't welcoming, didn't smile once, and wasn't attentive. Â She did her job and is knowledgeable but at the same time made my guest and I feel like we were annoying her by being there. Â It's a shame because everything else was great.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"4,"Some very tasty dishes stuck with me. I came to Sportello with a small group for restaurant week, but we decided to go rogue and go with the family style tasting menu instead. Everything we tried was satisfying, including the octopus salad, the pork chop, and the cod. What stood out, however, were the two pasta dishes we tried. The bolognese sauce was really tasty, but my favorite dish was the gnocchi with lobster, peas, and mushrooms. The sauce was rich and flavorful and the gnocchi were quite simply lovely (not a word I use for food very often, but they were so light and satisfying that it seems to match).The atmosphere was modern, but very casual as is typical in Boston currently. Service was friendly, helpful, and casual. Overall, we had a fun dinner. I recommend that you share dishes to try as much as possible. If we hadn't tried so many dishes and found the highlights, I would have probably not enjoyed dinner as much as I did.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,"What a wonderful experience. Â Sometimes, things get busy and maybe you fall a little bit behind. Â We were seated a bit after our reservation, no worries as it was made up for before we even got to the table. Â Both people at the hostess stand were pleasant and helpful.This place smells so good. Â The open kitchen is a great centerpiece and seems to be putting out a nonstop flurry of amazing dishes. I ate the octopus carpacchio, with squid ink chips and the bolognese. Â Both were...to die for.Sportello is now tied with Puritan & Co as my favorite restaurant in the Boston area. Â I will be back many times to continue judgement.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,"Much more casual atmosphere than we anticipated. Restaurant is open kitchen style and you get to sit around the kitchen and watch the hustle and bustle. We shared the octopus carpaccio, each had our own pastas (a must do because they are SO good and you won't want to share), and desserts. Carpaccio was divine and addicting. Pastas are incredible: as a not so big lobster or gnocchi lover I have to admit it was the best I've ever had. My husband also raved his pasta dish which had rabbit in it. I got the gelato of the day and he had the cannoli which were equally amazing.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"4,"I'm not the world's most adventurous eater and I never thought I would eat rabbit, but Sportello's strozzapreti with braised rabbit is hands down one of the most delicious pastas I've ever had!+ Strozzapreti with braised rabbit, picholine olives, rosemary ($27) -- My husband ordered this on our first visit here and I wasn't even planning on trying it, figuring that rabbit probably tasted gamey like lamb. However, he insisted I try a bite (his mistake!!) and I was in LOVE. I tried to play it cool and kept eating my gnocchi, but he could tell that I wanted more so, being the generous, newly-wed husband he is, he traded dishes with me!! I proceeded to devour his rabbit pasta. It's hard to describe the flavor, but it's definitely not gamey, and tasted almost like very tender chicken. The pasta was also a perfect texture and the flavor of the sauce was not too heavy but had a delicious umami savoriness to it!- Potato Gnocchi with lobster, mushroom ragu, peas ($29) -- This is what I ordered and I was really not feeling it. It wasn't just that the strozzapreti was SO much better, I just found this dish to be way too bland. The sauce reminded me of milk... just plain milk.On our next visit, we planned a surprise birthday dinner for a friend. I called in to make a reservation for 9 and found out some things about their large group reservation policy:Large parties have to do the $70 prix fixe ""feast menu"" and there's a 7% admin fee on top of the regular tax and 20% gratuity. Unfortunately, that was outside of the budget we had in mind so we planned to make a reservation elsewhere. However, after consulting with the kitchen, they graciously agreed to let us order a la carte for our party of 9, but let us know that if our numbers were to change and we have 10+ people, we would have to do the feast menu. (I can't remember if we still paid the extra 7% admin fee, but I think we may have.)During the dinner, I, of course, talked up the strozzapreti and almost everyone ordered it and everyone who got it was as smitten with it as me!",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,"This place is AMAZING! Every time I go the food tastes exactly the same, the way it should be in every restaurant. The tagliatelle bolognese transports you to Italyâ€‹ with the flavors. The servers are really nice, and it is pretty cool that you can see the kitchen closely. It is casual, nice, and great food. And don'tâ€‹ forget to grab an affogatoâ€‹ at the end of your meal.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"3,"Meh. I will be honest - this review is pretty much only for the lobster gnocchi. I went back and forth between getting the lobster gnocchi with peas and mushroom cream sauce or the tagliatelle bolognese. I made the wrong choice. I'm not a huge gnocchi fan anyway, but the reviews on yelp made it seem like the dish was the last stop before meeting god. I'm going to have to side with the other yelpers that said that the dish wasn't very flavorful. The pasta was kind of mushy, there wasn't much lobster at allll, the sauce needed salt or some other kind of flavor besides bland mushroom. My friends who got the tagliatelle really liked it. I'm not saying I'll never be back. If I do come back, I'll try the bolognese instead.The other reviewers who mentioned high prices and small portions are correct. This is a place with high-end prices, small portions and weird seating. Luckily, I was with a party of 8, so we got a table. I would have been annoyed if I had to eat my $29 mini-dish of pasta on a no-back stool crammed next to strangers. It's not my bag. I love Italian food more than life itself. If I get to choose, I'm going elsewhere.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,"Lovely. Wonderful interior. Great service. Loved the negroni, tomato soup and pea pod-shaped pasta.

The chef made me a special vegan meal which was pasta in a red sauce with vegetables. Others got the pork chop, steak, ramp tortellini, kale salad etc with a few appetizers. All said the kale salad was amazing.Drink selection was good and they were kind enough to bring some dessert wine for a birthday we were celebrating. So overall it was okay.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"5,"Barcelona does everything right - service, food, cocktails, atmosphere. We live in the neighborhood and go there frequently and are never disappointed. Last night, we didn't have a reservation so we went early (around 5:45) and were lucky enough to get a nice table near the bar. An hour later we would have no chance of being so lucky. First, the staff are just great there. Not snooty, but very efficient. We had a tandem of servers that worked so well in conjunction with each other. The various team members, from the bread to water to the manager (Guy) who was greeting people and making sure everyone was enjoying their meals, are all excellent. So professional yet fun and friendly. As for the food, Barcelona is just a great place for whatever mood you are in. Their Tapas menu has food that appeals to vegetarians, meat eaters, fish eaters, etc. So you can always find nice things to share. We opted for the razor clams (my wife said were fantastic), ham & cheese croquettes (fantastic), grilled hanger steak and shishido peppers. All were great. For our main course, we shared the whole grilled Branzino. At $25, with a huge accompaniment of watercress and roasted potatoes, this is the bargain of the South End. (see attached pic).Finally, we love all the cocktails there as the bartenders are top notch. We opted for the pitcher of Sangria this evening. Again, at $30, this is a major bargain as it yields about 7-8 glasses of Sangria. Very tasty - not too sweet.All in all, we just love Barcelona and will continue to go back frequently.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"SANGRIA. Say it louder for the people in the back! Trendy spot for tapas, with vegetarian and, drumroll, gluten-freeâ€‹ options. The hanger-steak, tortilla, croquettes and patatas bravas are the hoy-grail.

The menu has changed a tad bit but everything we got was delicious. The customer service was perfect; they didn't hover too much but they stopped by frequently enough.

Also the cocktails were very nice.,Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"3,"Yeah, no. Not the Barcelona I first experienced. And the fact that a visiting Sommelier got ZERO attention, leaving us to the ""experience"" of lovely servers - killed the mood for us. LOVED the croquetas and the bacon wrapped dates. But the much anticipated Paella de Chorizo and Morcilla with Garbanzos when a Seafood Paella was sent instead (with a ""seafood allergy on our table, AND THEY DIDNT COMP THE MISTAKE), fell flat on its lack of zocarrat and bland. I don't know what happened. The rice was overcooked, the paella had very little to no paprika flavor and none of the crunchy burned bits on the bottom. Another very disappointing dish was the fideua. The chicken fideua lacked crunch, was too salty and underwhelming.The place is super loud. Wines are spectacular. But the star plates of the evening were as disappointing as a blind date showing up in wrinkled and stained clothing - well-intended but poorly executed. I'm sorry Barcelona, we drove out from the 'burbs to meet Puerto Rico celebrity Sommelier and prized orthopedic surgeon Carlos Fraga and we were painfully disappointed. I had asked him to join us at Bar Boloud or Tresca, but he was looking forward to Spanish fare... I hope this isn't what you have become.... You have seen much better days!

At first, I wasn't sure if I picked the right place for dinner after watching the Boston Ballet's Romeo & Juliet, but our waiter from the very beginning provided excellent service and put us at ease.

The restaurant is a little hard to find, since it's tucked into a small street in the South End. The location also isn't too far from the nearest T-station, but it can still be about a 7min walk. We both started off with white sangria,s and I loved the light, refreshing taste of the drink, paired with bits of green apples. It was a nice contrast to the traditional, red sangrias, and I personally preferred the white sangria more! We were also served bread for the table, and it was warm, with a crunchy crust and soft inside. For the tapas, we ordered: + Grilled Octopus--very tender, and I loved the mustard-mayo sauce that came with it + Hanger steak with truffle steak--perfectly cooked to a medium rare with a nice, rich truffle sauce + Tuna Tartar--Very light, and perfectly seasoned with olive oil and capers+ Meatballs with ham tomato sauce--I'm usually not a big fan of meatballs, but these were so flavorful! The sauce also tasted great when dipped with bread+ Prawns a la plancha--THE BEST DISH! They were drenched in a very aromatic chili oil, the shell was crunchy, and the prawn meat was perfectly cooked+Churros with dulce de leche and WARMED! chocolate sauce--If you love cinnamon-sugar desserts, you will absolutely love this! It comes warmed to the table with caramel dipping sauce and warmed chocolateOverall, I loved my experience here and would highly recommend a visit!

Bar was busy, so the bartenders were busy. But I got a sample of a cocktail while I paid my tab and the seat at the bar let's you see the cool space better.Hard to decide what to order, but I loved everything I got: hanger steak with truffle vinaigrette (fave!), Chorizo (big brat-sized sausage cut into bites) with sweet and sour balsamic figs, jamon y manchego croquettes, and utterly PERFECT crusty sourdough bread and oil dip.The rose selection was simple, so I'd go for a busty red next time.

I was surprised to see that there were about a dozen things that were ruled in for me. This can be a rarity to find so many options that are vegan. The only draw back was that service was a bit slow, though they totally made up for this by comping me my beer since it came about 20 minutes after I ordered it.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"Made a reservation here for a weekday night for tapas.

Food was outstanding as well, definitely order the filet mignon, some jamÃ_n, shishito peppers, and mussels. Everything is tapas style so order 2-3 tapas per person. Everything had great flavors but a bit over salted. The managers checked on us multiple times and made sure we were seated at an excellent booth.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"4,"I went here on the suggestion of my friend who used to live in Boston. I've heard this is the second location, and it's slightly easier to get seats here. The restaurant itself was stunning. There's a large indoor and outdoor seating area and an extensive wine menu. I like that you can order wine at 3oz. and 6oz. The waiter was also very helpful, letting us taste the wine as well.We ordered around 4-5 tapas for two people. The bread is really good. I literally sat down and an older man eating alone turned to me and raved about the bread uninvited. Story checks out. The meatballs and croquettes were also delicious.I wasn't a huge fan of the shrimp (dry) and the layered potato dish (bland).

They were super packed on a Saturday night when I went so if you want a table, be prepared for a wait. Although, it was so busy, the horseshoe bar was completely packed as well so I was forced to stand during the entirety of my visit.It's sort of a chill, upscale vibe that is perfect a little later in your night out. Don't make it your first stop, don't make it your last. All the wine I got was great and the wine list is extensive enough for you to find something you'll surely enjoy. Prices aren't bad and they have some glasses in the $8-9 range while most are in the $11-14 range.

The restaurant has a wide selection of affordable tapas. The serving sizes are tiny though, but I appreciated that because I could try different things.My dining partner and I arrived on a crowded Saturday night with a 7pm reservation. Those without a reservation were quoted a wait or 1.5 hours. The bar was flooded with people, and the restaurant was packed and lively. I got seated in 10 minutes.Because the restaurant was busy, it took a while for our cups to be filled. The waiters and staff were friendly, but they couldn't pay close attention due to the crowd.Finally, onto the food. I tried the hanger steak, the grilled ribs, the spinach and chickpeas, the egg plant, and a tomato fish dish. The food cane out very quickly, and everything tasted good except the food temperature was weirdly lukewarm. I will come back again to try other tapas, and hopefully the restaurant is better on a weekday.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"I LOVE this place. Yes, it's tapas, so you pay a lot for a bunch of little plates. However, EVERYTHING here is delicious. The meat plates (bottom of the menu/save your stomach if you decide to order) are some of the best cooked, juiciest meat I've ever had. I think my favorite dish is actually the chickpea and spinach tapas - it has this amazing savory flavor that makes me want to actually eat vegetables. Also, DO NOT skip the croquettes - no one should miss out on those crispy balls of cheesy goodness. My chief complaint (and probably only) is that sometimes the menu can be tricky to translate. Most of the dish names are not in English so ask one of the friendly wait staff for recommendations if your Spanish is rusty like mine. Typically I would praise the wine list, but they actually have awesome cocktails here too! Excellent spot for noshing with friends or taking a classy date (only date people who are willing to share their food, obviously).",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"I've been here multiple times, but never for brunch. The brunch was great! Brunch tapas style was awesome - I always never know if I should get savory or sweet for brunch but this was perfect because I got savory (veggie Benedict which was amaaaazing) and sweet (French toast also very good). Didn't get to do this but saw that they have a build your own Bloody Mary station. Would definitely recommend making a reservation - this place is always packed. Parking is tough to find on the street but there is a parking lot right next door.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"A note: I actually visited this restaurant about a year ago, I just completely forgot to write a review. Oops. Better late than never though, right?To celebrate our anniversary my boyfriend decided to bring me to Barcelona Bar -- he'd been before with a family member and had fallen in love, insisting we visit. Because it was the holiday season (January 2nd) the place was unsurprisingly busy, so we were glad we'd made a reservation. We were quickly sat in a booth near the bar and as we waited for our waitress I took in the restaurant. It has the perfect vibes for a date night or a special occasion -- lots of dim lighting and woodsy details in other words -- and was filled with attractive men and women. If you don't already have a date Barcelona Bar might actually be a solid place to find one (haha). We started with a meat & cheese board (which I can't remember the exact details of) and continued with a few cocktails and many, many, MANY tapas. Here are the ones I remember: Calamari Plancha, Spicy Eggplant Caponata, Mussels al Ajillo, Blistered Shishitos (my boyfriend orders these EVERYWHERE), JamÃ_n & Manchego Croquettes, Albondigas, Grilled Pulpo (the highlight of the night, the octopus was crispy but tender at the same time), and Grilled Hanger Steak (another highlight). We loved everything and were both unbelievably impressed not only with the flavors and presentation of the dishes, but also the technique. The only dish I would NOT recommend is the Spicy Eggplant Caponata. It really doesn't taste spicy (at least to me) and is on the sweet side. And I swear, I'm not usually ""that person"", but the texture of this dish actually gave me goosebumps. It was cold and mushy but with enough bite to it that it lingered for far too long. Not pleasant. PS: We visited Barcelona Bar's Brookline location more recently and I personally prefer this location. While the other has more space (and better lighting) I find the South End location far more elegant and intimate, making it a better spot for dinner in my opinion. Plus, I think the service and food is just a touch better here.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"3,"3 stars;We had a 6:15 reservation and did not get seated until an hour later - utterly ridiculous. Their excuse was that people were taking their time at the restaurant and not leaving. I dunno how restaurants figure out balancing reservations and walk-ins, but not being able to be seated WITH A RESERVATION until an hour later is unthinkable and a huge misstep on their part. Now, once we got seated, the staff was quite courteous and sent us several tapas on the house. This was probably Barcelona's saving grace, and the only reason this didn't turn out to be a two-star review. We ordered potatas bravas, spicy eggplant, octopus, and some type of meatball. We were given an additional order of potatas bravas, fried brussel sprouts, a cheese board, and a potato tortilla. At the time everything tasted delicious since we were starving, but looking back, the food was definitely lacking.The potatas bravas tasted were quite chunky and honestly just tasted like home fries from a breakfast diner. Octopus was way too salty and slightly over cooked, brussel sprouts and the eggplant were also quite salty, though they did have good flavor. The eggplant would have delicious mixed with a bowl of rice (sry my Asian is showing). The meatballs were only ok with flavors akin to a typical italian meatball in marinara. It was a mediocre experience at best.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"5,"In love with the ambiance of this place. I came with a friend and really enjoyed the service of one woman in particular working at the bar named Alexis.

We travel to Boston probably 6-8 times a year and always try to visit somewhere new. This particular time, we were in town for a show and my girlfriend's birthday so this was her pick. Man, did she nail it. We had a pretty early reservation to make it to the show on time, and mostly had the bar to ourselves. We got to hang out with Peter who's the OG of this joint, and a super nice, knowledgeable dude. In all, we had the shishitos, the wedge salad, the korean tacos, and the buttermilk fried chicken wings. Everything was great, but two standouts for us: reading, ""wedge salad"", you might think, ""meh, had about 1,000 of those"", but this was a much different, very welcome take on it. Along with normal things like bacon, blue cheese, and hard boiled eggs, were quinoa, asparagus, shredded beets, honey mustard. It might sound like a mismatched mess, but I tell you it was perfect. Every ingredient shined in it's own way and it was the most delicious, interesting salad I've had in some time. Then there were those wings. We've been down south pretty recently and their chicken frying is something else entirely from what I usually see in the northeast, but this was about as good as it gets. Crispy, tender, fall of the bone, right amount of salt. We were still talking about it 3 days later. Then there was Peter, casually asking about dietary restrictions earlier on in the meal and secretly delivering a gluten free dessert for my girlfriend. To say this place made our trip would be an understatement. Our next trip to Boston, we won't be trying somewhere new, we'll be trying the rest of the menu. I hope the lucky people in this neighborhood take advantage of this gem as much as they should.

Â The chef & owner Asia Mei was actually personally delivering every dish to the customers!Now for the food. I had the Jalapeno rangoons which was an excellent mix of spicy, creamy, and sweet wrapped in a perfectly crispy shell. Then came the chicken and waffles. It saus on the menu that its ""the best in Boston"" boy, do I believe it! Hands down the best chicken amd waffles I have ever had. That waffle (though a bit small. Aparently you can order an extra if you want) was absolutely wicked. Purely insane! The texture, density, and flavor are nuts. It almost seemed like the waffle was lightly deep fried after it was cooked, to create the perfectly firm outer bits and deliciously moist soft insides. The chicken that comes with it must be the most tender chicken I have ever had, falling off the bone like you would not believe and perfectly crunchy batter crust. I asked for some hot sauce to go with it, as I always like that mix of sweet and spicy with chicken and waffles. I didn't use any, because it didnt need it, it was already perfect.Drinks and the bread putting for desert were also suitably delicious but nothing can top that chicken and waffles so I will just stop there.This place is now a must visit any time I am in Boston.Thanks again Peter and Asia! -John",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"4,Went here for dinner and had a wonderful time.

While visiting Boston, my husband and I chose this place for dinner on a Thursday evening. Reviews looked great, location was nearby our hotel, but the deciding factor was that they have a meal named ""The Leslie Knope"" (we are huge Parks & Rec fans!!). We didn't order it, but the fact that it existed was enough :DGrabbed seats at the bar and were quickly greeted by the friendly bartender. So far our service experiences in Boston hadn't been great, so this was a big plus right off the bat. We each ordered a cocktail (can't remember the names and the cocktail menu isn't online) - mine was gin based and his was bourbon based - we both enjoyed our choices. $12 cocktails, but they were great and lasted us the whole meal.For food, I had the Hawaiian tuna-salmon poke bowl and my husband had the Thai crispy chicken basil rice bowl. OMG, both of our bowls were delicious! I tried some of the chicken and it was cooked so perfectly - moist and flavorful. The fish in my bowl was so fresh tasting and the other ingredients complemented perfectly. There were definitely other things on the menu I'd love to try if in town again in the future. I also want to share this: apparently this night was our bartender's birthday. A local couple grabbed seats next to us at the bar and brought him home-made cookies for his birthday!

The host, our server, and the chef all were quite friendly. Some restaurants behave differently once you tell them you have a Groupon, but thankfully that didn't happen here. Â Most of the food was good too - the lasagna squares app really stood out, a must try! The local greens salad was yummy too, especially the crispy kale on top. Lows:The Irish curry was way too spicy. The chef did try to reduce the spice in the second attempt but it was still pretty spicy. I like that they asked us if anything was wrong and tried their best to accommodate our request. It didn't work but that's okay, it happens.What I don't appreciate is when restaurants sneak in charges. The Groupon was supposed to be $92 in value, covering 1 app, 1 salad, 2 entrees and 1 dessert. While ordering the entree, the server asked us if we'd like to add any protein to the curry. We did but apparently that's an extra charge not covered by the Groupon. That's fine but let us know beforehand, and not after I look at the bill and enquire. So even though our bill came to approx $75, we still had to pay for the ""additions"".",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"3,"My girl and I were seated promptly by the hostess. The waitress soon came by to take our orders. However, the food didn't arrive for almost half an hour. Service was also slow for the nearby tables. It felt a little weird to have both the hostess and waiter to check in frequently. We both ordered the burger. My girlfriend said her burger (medium rare) lacked flavor.

Was very easy to make reservations, not too busy for a Thursday evening. The ambience has pretty good dim mood lighting, and I appreciated the large booths - alternatively you could sit at a high top. The hostess and our server were both very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.The Groupon for two includes: 1 app, 1 salad, 2 entrees, 1 dessert. So our dinner consisted of: buttermilk fried chicken, house salad, steak frites, crispy flounder fillet (an extra side of brussel sprouts), and butterscotch pudding with an added scoop of peanut butter ice cream.The fried chicken was pretty good, the meat was fall off the bone with very crispy breading/skin. The ranch sauce it came with was also pretty good, and the celery slaw had the perfect tang as a compliment. The salad was a mix of greens with a mound of fried sseaweed on top. At first I was like nah, that's way too much seaweed. But the chef knows what she's doing when she designed this salad. The flavors and the texture contrasts were on point. I'd pay to have that salad again. The steak frites were ordered with the horseradish sauce on the side (will talk about that later), which would normally smother the steak on top of the shoestring fries. This can lead to soggy fries, so if you're not into that be warned. My dining partner didn't mind though and said that the steak was perfectly cooked. My crispy flounder was SO good. The fillet sat on top of two slice of fried green tomatoes, which when dipped in the horseradish sauce from earlier, was stellar. The sauce had tons of shrimp and tomato in it, an overall killer dish. The roasted brussel sprouts were also delicious - and this coming from someone who usually hates brussel sprouts. The ending butterscotch pudding was velvety and smooth and the perfect ending to the meal.So would I be back? Likely only for drinks as the bar area seemed happening. The food is a little too pricey for me to do on the reg, something that other reviewers have mentioned. Case in point, the side of Brussels sprouts were about the size of a small rice bowl (maybe 1 cup) and cost $7 - yikes! They were amazing....but still. We also had 2 Sapporos at $6 each.In the end I did enjoy this meal, simply because I felt like I got Â  a good value from it. I was able to get a 25% discount code on Groupon, so I didn't pay the full $55. Next, Groupon+ gives a cashback of 50% up to $10, AND THEN, I AIN'T DONE YET, Yelp gives a cashback of 10%. These cashbacks (linked to a credit card, so make sure it's the same one), which indeed stack on top of the groupon credit, were applied to the balance due with drinks, the side, and tax. Win, win, win!Also this shouldn't have to be stated, but do tip on the full amount. Don't be cheap. The receipt actually lists all the food you get as the Groupon sale price at $55. I added up all the items as they were priced on the menu and tipped off of that.

Tequila Toddy: This guy was on their cocktail special for the evening so we gave it a try. This is a WARM cocktail, as you might imagine. Â Sweet, light, lemonlicious and soothing after a chilly walk. I thought that the slice of lemon with cloves was just a perfect garnish. Simple, flavorful, and sure to become a classic I'll formulate my own spin off of, no doubt. Manhattan: Stiff, strong, tasty, and classic. I order these in all kinds of ways, all over this country, and this is one of my faves. It was mixed well, chilled perfectly, and presented in a classic manner. LOVE IT!Bacon Wrapped Stuffing Bites: These were really freaking tasty! I mean who doesn't like bacon wrapped appetizers? These little bites were nice two bite sized pieces that come 4 to a skewer and were served atop an arugula/mixed greens salad and a really tasty vinaigrette. They were crispy, bacony goodness on the outside and a taste of the happiest holidays in the middle. I think this was a $9 appThrowback Korean BBQ Tacos: These were also THE BOMB DIGGITY!!! As a half Korean, I was excited to see this fusion on the menu. I was amazed at the simple, yet complex flavor combination of spicy, sweet, savory, and absolutely delectable! Asian pear kimchi and candied ginger? Count me in! You get to for $15Southie's Favorite Irish Curry: Again, this was a perfectly balanced plate. There was spice, heat, curry, rice, veggies, and BOLD delicious flavor. My fiance added steak atop his for an extra $10 making the plate $27 in total. The steak was cooked well, and it was a very filling portion. If anyone is curious, this dish does REHEAT in the microwave well, without changing the flavor.Mushroom Tofu Burger: Again, I was impressed with this burger. I have eaten LOTS of burgers in life, but this by far has been the best of the NON meat variety. Â I am not a fan of the texture of this burger, but it was a new thing to me all together. The burger had rich mushroom flavor, and the mouth feel of bread stuffing that has been crisped up on the outside. It came with house cut shoestring french fries, and toppings. This is a VERY filling burger that I was able to only eat half of. Â $16House made Shoestring french fries: These guys are thin, but weren't so much crispy. I Feel like they were very basic fries, but still tasty. I do plan on going Â back here one day to try out some more of this amazing, fun and creative menu. I feel like this would be a really good date night place for some adventurous eaters!",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"5,Buttermilk chicken is the bomb here! We also loved the party tots. Chef Asia is amazing and she is so personable and friendly. We will come here any time and highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some great food options!,Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"5,"Wow! Hidden gem. I don't usually venture to southie for brunch but now I will! We came by because I noticed that they make their own hash. I really dislike canned hash so I've taken it upon myself to hunt down as much ""real"" hash as possible.We had a Bloody Mary and an Irish coffee. The Bloody Mary was delicious!! Try the firecracker option. I had the crab eggs Benedict and my bf ordered the hash. The sauce on the eggs Benedict was AMAZING. Little light on the crab but that was as expected. Overall a great dish. Now to the hash.... just blew me away. It was perfect. I'm coming back for it! My bf barely let me steal a bite because he wanted it all for himself . I highly recommend this place!",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"4,"I went here with a few friends for Sunday brunch because there was a deal on Groupon+. I got the shrimp and grits, and it was pleasant. It was my first time eating grits, so it was like a bowl of mashed potatoes for me which I liked. The sauce was spicy, buttery, and overall very flavorful. It was garnished with scallions and caramelized onions and garlic slices. I was disappointed though that the shrimp was not larger. It's served with several bite sized shrimp instead of a few, larger prawns, which I didn't expect since the dish was $17.The menu is Asian-American fusion. There are interesting choices for starters and entrees, and they have a full bar with unique cocktails. The average price of dishes is a couple dollars more than I think it's worth, so I'd only come back with Groupon.",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"5,"Stopping in for dinner at your restaurant we were happy to enjoy the wonderful service, great food and neighborly advice!We visited Moonshine 152 after seeing Chef Asia Mei competing on Chopped. Â As a fan of interesting flavor combinations I was intrigued. Â Not only was the food delicious but the drinks were also exactly what a group of thirsty tourists (from Dallas) needed!Thank y'all for exceeding every expectation!",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"4,"So many new and delicious ways to add an eastern influence into western food. The Bloody Mary with kimchi juice is so good my friend immediately ordered one after tasting mine. Shrimp and grits with an unidentified slight drizzle of Asian flavoring and strips of (bok choy?) is a new favorite. I know unidentified drizzle doesn't sound great - but I promise it's delicious! The only thing that makes this a 4 instead of 5 star review is the service. Our server was friendly and attentive even when the restaurant was busy. However as the restaurant slowed down we waited 30 min for our check, had other servers let her know we were waiting for her, and still had to stop her as she ran by our table.",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"5,"Hooray for Locale's pizza! My fiancÃ© and I were in the area one late afternoon. We found Locale's dark exterior appealing, since we both love wearing black, even in 90-degree weather. Upon entering the establishment, we were immediately greeted by two waitresses. The place was empty, considering we came around 2PM. We started off with their toasted garlic bread. Highly recommend this. It's crunchy, garlicky and buttery. The bread also comes with a side of tomato sauce. For pizza, we ordered the Polpette, which is made up of their homemade tomato sauce, homemade meatballs, ricotta, and pickled chilies. A satisfying pie indeed! Everything about this particular brick oven pizza screams ""YUM."" The dough was toasted to perfection, and the meatballs just melt in your mouth. I can't wait to come back here.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"A nice little place. My boyfriend and I got seated right when we walked in the door. The place was a little tight - depending on where you sit you can be kind of elbow-to-elbow - but you've got to keep that in mind when dining in the North End on the weekends. They did seem try to usher people in and out as fast as possible Â (I think we were in and out within 45 minutes). It's understandable because the place is small, but I was a lil disappointed cause I hadn't been here before and was hoping for a slow evening.That being said, I was a huge fan of Locale's food. We skipped the apps and just ordered pizzas - I got the Cacio E Pepe, and my boyfriend got the Tartufo. I was kinda worried that Cacio E Pepe translated to a pizza would be too dry, but it was honestly amazing. My boyfriend and I traded slices too, for purely unbiased opinions. I normally love mushroom pizza but wasn't the hugest fan of his Tartufo; he, on the other hand, seemed to be a big fan of the Cacio.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Whenever I go out to eat, the one thing I seek the most is value. In the North End--and even the City of Boston as a whole--the place that comes to mind is Locale. I've come here on a few occasions and have been thoroughly impressed by a number of things: the ambiance, the service, and more importantly, the food. On the nights I have come here, the restaurant exudes a cozy and warm atmosphere, with polished woods and fake (but still mood changing) candlelight. Furthermore, the service is prompt and attentive. But to me, it is the food that makes me return, as the pizzas are extremely high quality and unique to the restaurant all while delivering in great price point. The crust is slightly dense and purposefully just a bit burnt. There is a good amount of sauce, as I tend to prefer saucier pizzas. The cheese is stretchy and aids to the pizza experience in the way it should. What makes these pies really special is that they use charcuterie quality meats as toppings. Even eating one of their pepperoni pizzas will be a new experience. This isn't the place to get one giant pizza, as they only serve more petite style pizzas. However, it is a great opportunity to share and try out different combinations of toppings you would not have done so otherwise. Whether you're dining solo or with a group of friends, you won't regret a trip to Locale.tldr: cozy and comfy atmosphere with great food at great prices",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"We've heard nothing but positive things about Locale, so it's surprising that it took so long for us to check it out. That said, the hype we'd been fed led to some inflated expectations. Locale lived up in some areas and was just okay in others.First, the service was really good. Our waitress was super nice and our plates were cleared and waters filled quickly. All of the staff that we encountered were pleasant. The space is small, but welcoming, and the prices are really fair, so on those fronts, Locale nails it!The food was good, but I wasn't left in awe, as I had hoped. The meatballs were quite dry, but they were still still decent. I'd imagine they're usually better, as one of the people in our group went there regularly and commented on the same thing. The margherita pizza was good, but not my favorite in the North End. The tartufo pizza was my favorite item, for sure, so I'm thinking you're better off ordering one of the more ""adventurous"" pizzas on the menu. Salads were larger than I expected, simple, and delicious.Overall, the food is good and I'd have no reservations recommending Locale for the overall experience. Sure, you can probably find better pizza and meatballs in the North End, but with the price points, chill atmosphere, and wonderful service, you can't really go wrong with Locale. Plus, it's slightly removed from the heart of the chaos that crowds the North End! Enjoy!",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Katie was the PERFECT waitress. She continuously checked in on us, apologized for having us wait ( which we really didn't and absolutely didn't notice), she gave us great recommendations and made sure we were okay the entire time. The brick oven pizza is AMAZING (we didn't expect anything less from little Italy). Coming from a New Yorker, his pizza is ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC and if we could visit Katie every time we came we absolutely would. 5/5 stars for the restaurant and our waitress.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,My boyfriend and i stopped by locale as i was visiting him in Boston. We were looking for a place with good brick over pizza and salad and locale was perfect. The food came out extremely fast and we were not disappointed! We came on a Thursday night around 8 and were seated immediately. Definitely try the garlic bread appetizer it was super yummy. The Brussels sprout pizza was also fantastic and we loved that we could get one pizza with two different topics on either side because we were torn between two on the menu!,Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,I was just notified that I put a one-star review for this restaurant that is false my account has been compromised the food and service is 5 * +please ignore the last review. Food and service there is amazing,Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Nice interior and fresh pizza in the North End!Locale is an affordable, brick oven pizza spot, lined with subway tiles and iron chairs. They have several tables and an open kitchen, cooking up fresh pizza and a few appetizers. We went on a Thursday night around 5:30pm and the restaurant was quiet and warm.We chose the garlic toast and the polpette pizza. The garlic toast came out served with hot marinara sauce for dipping. The toast was served as four rectangular slices, toasted with just the right amount of garlic.The pizza came out soon after, piping hot. The polpette has tomato sauce, homemade meatballs (which actually were not served as balls, but more of a sausage, maybe we got the wrong thing?), pickled peppers and ricotta. Delish!The crust was chew and crunchy. The cheese added a good amount of creaminess and rounded out the pickled pepper zing. At $16 for the pizza, it was very reasonable.The service was straight-forward and fairly friendly. This is a great spot if you're looking for good pizza but nothing to blow you away.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"* BOTTOM LINE:Simple and good pizza places have gone out of vogue. Locale is a fantastic, unpretentious, and affordable pizza place in the heart of North End. Come here if you want piping hot wood fired pizza with interesting flavors and no frills. * THE SPACE / SERVICE: Small, but airy. There are mostly two and four person tables, which they can combine for big groups but it'd be hard. We went at 3pm on a Saturday and it was half full. Service was fantastic. Our waitress was kind and friendly and pizza came quickly. * PIZZA:The menu is simple but they do their pizza damn well. Us two got two pizzas and left with generous leftovers. Polpette - the meatball pizza -- meatballs cut and put on pizza like pepperoni slices. So. Good. The best part are the pickled chiles which add a nice tang to the pizza, which could easily get heavy. The special - white pizza with pistachio pesto and sausage -- amazing. This thing really highlighted how good the crust is here. It's sturdy but not too thick and the crust is insanely airy. They brushed the pesto on the crust so it ended up tasting like ridiculously good garlic bread. Overall, locale is one of the best pizza joints we've visited in a long time. Come here for freshly made pizza and a solid wine list!",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"If you're looking for a place to have a romantic dinner or a fancy corporate outing this aint your spot, but if you are looking to grab an awesome pizza on the fast, you should definitely check it out. The oven operates at solar heat levels, so be expecting to see your pie in less than 5 minutes; great dough and excellent ingredients. I had the puttanesca (pizza version) and arugula salad and would repeat anytime.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"3,"I walked around for awhile trying to find a somewhat decent and well priced place to eat. It came down to here since the simple pizzas were more affordable than other places. It wasn't crowded at the time I went, but the service was good, at least before the crowd came in after 1230pm.The menu is short and simple. Each pizza is 12"". But if you're hungry you can finish it. I got the margherita pizza, which is cheese and basil, although a bit skimpy. It took a moment for it to come out, but it was quite good. The crust was a little bland, but cooked well, it was chewy and soft.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"This small brick oven pizza shop is a great spot for a late afternoon lunch in the North End. I ate here with a group of 7 on a Saturday at 2pm, a little later than typical lunch time. The space was full of happy eaters.Between the 7 of us, we ordered 5 pies. They only come in a 12 inch size. 5 was perfect for us, with a couple pieces for leftovers. My favorites were the margherita (just a nice classic taste) and the spinach with ricotta. They brought us a balsamic glaze for that one, which was a great addition. My least favorite was the one with anchovies. I didn't think I'd like it, but gave it a try anyways. It was just a little too fishy for me. My dad really enjoyed that one though.I think about 3/4 of a pizza is plenty for one person, or a whole pizza if you're super hungry. They are reasonable prices, something like $15-19 per pie. To me, it's not a ""let's plan a fancy night out in the North End"" place, but it's definitely a ""I had this great pizza once, & if we're ever in the North End again, let's go back there"" place.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,The Tartufo is a must!!! Â You must get the balsamic sauce with it!!!! I promise you won't be disappointed!!! The staff is amazing and friendly!!!,Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"I am from New York - pizza haven, and honestly this pizzeria exceeds pizzerias in New York. Tasty, and the ingredients are very fresh. I must say that the staff is superb. I felt welcomed, not rushed, friendly and just a good eat. Must try.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Locale makes my favourite pizza in the North End. Aside from the occasional pie from Regina's or slice from Rina's, I'm all about Locale. I would recommend The Picante or The Rocco for its generous use of salami and sausage. I order take out from here often and don't have to walk far with my pizza. It holds up well. I've tried some of the appetizers both during dine-in and take out visits and I can't remember being blown away from the salads and meatballs. And maybe that's not to say the appetizers aren't great. Perhaps my mind, and stomach, are so focused on pizza when I have Locale in mind that the appetizers become an after thought. I don't know. But I can for sure attest to the quality and taste of their pizzas. It's the first restaurant to come to mind on pizza day!",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"2,"Stopped in on a Sunday night as we heard the pizza here was great. Service was sort-of friendly. We ordered one of their specialty pizzas with broccolini on it, but it didn't work with the rest of the toppings and was actually not very good. You would think they'd come up with topping combos that work. The meatball was boring, but fine. The pizza crust was pretty good. The overall experience was blah. I wouldn't recommend this place as you can't trust their flavor profiles for their signature pizzas.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,Wow! The pizza was great. We had the spinach and the tartufo and they were Â both excellent! Â The waitress suggested the meatball app and it was awesome! We've lived in the North End for a year and this was our first time here but it won't be our last! The waitress was wonderful-helpful suggestions with food and wine choices and attentive.,Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"2,"Went to this restaurant for dinner. It had a nice atmosphere. The food did take a while to come out to us. We ordered the Calabrese pizza which states to have ""Sweet Pork Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Hot Cherry Peppers"" on the menu. When we received the pizza I saw that it had jalapeÃ±os on it which I am not a fan of. I tried one slice of the pizza hopeful the jalapeÃ±o wouldn't have too much of an effect on the other all pizza but I did not like this pizza at all. I let my boyfriend eat this pizza and I ordered the Piccante pizza which had pepperoni. This pizza came out much faster than the pizza before (about 1/4 of the time). It wasn't served looking quite as pretty as the others. This pizza was more to my liking flavor wise but the middle of the pizza was very soft and I didn't find biting into it to be very satisfying in that great pizza way. The crust was good but mine on my pizza was a bit burnt. My boyfriend did claim to love the calabrese pizza and was glad to have it to myself. The pizzas where decently priced at $17 and $12. Overall this wasn't a great pizza experience for me and I wouldn't recommend this pizza over quicker/cheaper by the slice pizza.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Fantastic find. Â Excellent, fresh pizza in a cozy atmosphere tucked away in the North End. Â Will go back again!",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,So had to try this place out since it had 4 1/2 stars and almost 300 reviews. Â I grew up in household with authentic New York Italian (yes I actually did) and I have been making my own pizza for about 10 years now. Â I'm very picky when it comes to pizza. Â I have eaten the best in a number of different cities and I can say this pizza is really good... I especially like their dough. Â They also stand behind their quality. Â 5 Stars... I would definitely come back and recommend it to others.,Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Brendan and Becca: Went to The Gallows for a simple birthday dinner with some friends. The design of the restaurant is warm, with lots of creatively designed wood pieces. Overall, very attractive and fitting for the gastropub feel that they seem to be shooting for. We started dinner with the Buffalo Cauliflower and fried babybel cheese. Both were absolutely delicious. The cauliflower was refreshingly spicy without being overpowering. The cheese was cooked well, smooth and soft. We both had burgers. They were cooked nearly exactly the way that we had asked. Overall, pretty juicy and delicious. Frankly, neither of us felt that the burgers were anything special. Definitely not the best burger I've ever had, but certainly a quality burger that would bring be back to The Gallows. The service was great, no complaints here. In sum, a good experience that delivered quality food. Nothing life changing, but not every meal can can be. Definitely will be back. Would recommend to others.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Great experience here! Our server was super friendly and helpful, bringing us samples of their beer to try. She was very patient with us while we were placing our orders and checked up on us frequently during our meal. The food was great as well, we ordered the buffalo cauliflower to share and I got the falafel burger with pizza fries. Everything was fantastic except I found the french fries to be a little on the soggy side. Cool ambiance as well, its a little dimly lit with fake candles. I would recommend checking this place out.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"3,"Indifferent. That's how I felt leaving this restaurant after brunch. Brunch was for two people. We split a doughnut ordered a cocktail and two entrees. They don't have iced coffee, but they'll bring you ice on the side. Don't forget to ask for cream! They didn't bring/ask if I wanted any. I had the breakfast skillet. It came with a nice spicy aioli but lacked something. The eggs were undercooked and It had a flavor but there were too many potatoes. It seemed like they were trying to just fill the plate. Overall, I probably wont go back unless someone suggests it or wants to try.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,A party of 3 of us arrived slightly after 5pm on a Friday and there was no problem getting a table. The bar was popping and only got busier as the night wore on. We got the following items: Scotch egg - I have a soft spot for anything with soft boiled egg but this was delicious! Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. I loved how the egg yolk spread onto the sausage. This is much better than the scotch egg at hops n scotch. Simple poutine - I love fries but I will say that this was a bit boring and I will probably skip this next time or try a different version. It really wasn't anything special and wasn't worth the carbs or cost. Maverick burger with truffle fries - another item with an egg! It makes it extra delicious. The burger was solid and fresh tasting. I think it's a little more unique than other burgers I've had and would recommend this particular one if you're looking for a burger. The truffle fries were totally worth the up cost fee. It is probably the best truffle fries I've ever had because they were tasty and crispy at the same time. Fried chicken - the fried chicken was solid fried chicken but it's nothing something I would go out of my way for. I do recall it being a little spicy. I think they dribbled spicy sauce on top of it so beware of that. This is definitely a solid restaurant and will be back!,The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Loved the atmosphere of this place! It was a bit expensive, but the food was so amazing! My friend and I both ordered the breakfast nachos. We barely spoke the entire time, we were so consumed with eating the food. That meal was vegetarian friendly!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. It's nice and hip and dark. Made a reservation for a party of three and we were seating almost immediately even though missing one person.For foods we got:Pork Rillette - we all didn't really like this. It's the dinner special but was extremely underwhelming and lacked flavor.Spanish Octopus - an amazing flavorful dish. 100% would get this every time. Well paired with the bread.Classic Poutine - exactly as the name states a classic poutine. Simple and delicious.South Korea Poutine - had kimchi, short rib, and other classic Korean flavorings. It was made well. The flavors went well with each other and it was quite tasty. Would get this one again as well.Overall 4/5 as most of the dishes were good and the service was great!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Pretty cool place. The ambiance is really nice, and I liked the decor. The drink list is really cool, there were some really fun options and creative cocktails. I got the Queen Bee and it was light and really flavorful at the same time. I really enjoyed how fresh it was. Our service was really good as well, prompt and efficient without feeling like they were right next to us the whole time. I HAD to get the Scotch Egg when I saw it on the menu, I had not had one since I was in London over 10 years ago and was so thrilled to see it, and it was delish!! My friend and I both got the Pub Burger. It was delightful and the onion aioli really hit the spot. This is a cool little spot, I would head here again just for a refreshing cocktail and a Scotch Egg!!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Stopped by The Gallows for brunch this past Saturday. We ordered the Sunrise Poutine and the Corned Beef Hash. The Corned Beef Hash came with a ton of food. The hash was homemade (nothing that resembles catfood) and the sourdough toast was fresh as well. The Sunrise Poutine was divine. A brunch spin on traditional poutine, so fries, gravy and cheese curds but with 2 eggs and bacon in top. This portion is giant and could easily be eaten by two. The service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was quaint. Perfect for Saturday brunch. One thing that struck me as odd: We asked for poached eggs instead of sunny side up and were told they can't poach eggs? What brunch/breakfast establishment can't poach an egg? We settled on over easy and they were still delish.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"I've been going to The Gallows for a couple years now and they have consistently maintained the same level of quality and excellence in food service. I had Emily as my server as she commanded the back booth section. It was getting later in the night, and i believe that her section was closed after seating us. I only know this from working in a restaurant and could tell they weren't going to seat anyone else there. This did not stop Emily from providing high level service. She was attentive and checked in on time every time, never rushed us at any point. We ordered The Daily Catch & the Steak Frites. Both were cooked to perfection, the risotto was amazing. The drinks were also both tasty. I will continue to make date nights to The Gallows, so long as the consistency remains present.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,Found this place on our last visit and what a cool place it was!The staff was friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was relaxed and low key.I will definitely put this place on our list of places to revisit next time we're in town,The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"This place receives 4 stars for the ambiance but 3 stars for the food. The place is modern, dimly lit, ok for a date, and fun. I got the steak frites (28$). The steak was just ok. Not the best steak i ever had but still edible. The fries were actually horrible. The salties fries u can ever find. I hope i dont get in hypertensive coma. Lol. I had a glass of red wine accompany the meat ($11). A friend ordered the mousse dessert. It looked like cappucino but i think she was happy although couldnt finish. Overall great ambiance but average food. Would i go again? Possibly but i wouldnt be too excited.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"You know, eff it -- I'm gonna give this place 5 stars. When I have friends visiting and they tell me they're craving a burger, I love taking them to this trendy and very classy bar and grill. With walk-ins, I never have to wait too long. I really dig the cabin vibe of the wood tables and walls and hanging dim light fixtures that criss cross along the ceiling! We started with their Scotch Egg which, if you can imagine, is a soft boiled egg wrapped in pork sausage that is then fried crispy. FRIED. *le drool* I sank my teeth into their Brie and Apple Burger which was not on the menu the last time I visited. I like that they change it up every now and again. Keeps me coming back! I think they'll cook the burger ""medium"" (aka perfection) unless you request otherwise! The staff is incredibly friendly and always open to make suggestions! If you order a burger, you can ask to upgrade your side of fries to truffle parmesan fries or poutine so why not? You're here for a good time, not a long time. ;D",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"We were looking for a relaxed atmosphere to get dinner our first night in Boston. Thanks to Yelp, I found The Gallows which had great reviews and was a 20 min walk from our hotel. It was around 8:30 when we arrived, but it was Wednesday so there were a few open tables. I tried the Queen Bee cocktail to start. It was a delicious mix of Pear-infused gin, ginger, honey, lemon, and prosecco. It was fabulous!!For our meals, my boyfriend got the fried chicken and I went for the Mook burger. The chicken was plentiful and breaded to perfection. It was served with a spicy honey sauce that had quite a kick. It was a good kind of kick though that didn't make your lips burn for an hour after the meal. The bacon potato salad was also really tasty. I'm going to need to find a recipe for that!I was a little nervous about all of the items on my burger. It included Italian charcuterie, fresh mozzarella, basil pesto, balsamic aioli, pickles, lettuce, tomato. The flavors of everything together was like magic! It ended up being a fork and knife burger because it was super messy. I ate the entire burger and most of the delicious fries served with it.This was a great opening to our Boston food tour and if we ever make it back to the city, I would definitely return!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Nice atmosphere and delicious food. The portion sizes are large, the wait staff are knowledgeable and kind. The drinks are delightful. This place is a sure bet for yummy food, drinks and overall experience.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Was looking for a cool, young atmosphere bar and restaurant and found the Gallows! The theme is pretty dark in here - the wall has a huge ouiji board and the general atmosphere is pretty warm, but decorations tip off the darkness (also, clearly from the name, The Gallows). Drinks were SO GOOD. My friend and I had the Queen Bee and Smokey and the Bandit, both were amazing, great taste and not too strong. We shared a plate, something with carrots, which was a new combination of veggies for me. The only thing, the service was a little odd... the waitress was kind, and strangely folded our napkins for us when either of us left the table. Not sure if it's a cleanliness thing, but doesn't change my opinion!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1,"This was my favorite place to grab a burger in Boston. However, management in their infinite wisdom, decided to get rid of the Maverick burger (and Truffle fries) and that royally makes me mad. I only went to the Gallows for this amazing burger topped with pork belly AND a fried egg. Make your mouth water?? Well, FU because it's no longer available.Bring back the Maverick and I will be back. Otherwise, time to find another best burger in Boston.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"3,"A solid 3 star, but not quite 4. Had a couple of drinks (Diet Bud the menu calls Bud Light). Ordered a half order of Poutine. It was good, but not great. Very crispy fries and a good brown gravy, but the cheese curds were the consistency of soft feta. I'm not sure if they were homemade or if they just don't know what a cheese curd is. A good cheese curd is required for good poutine. I ordered the chopped salad. Absolutely fantastic everything bagel croutons. Too many chick peas. Tasty balsamic dressing. Wife ordered flat top grilled burger. Great beef taste. Nice soft bun. 2 drinks. 1/2 app. Salad and burger. $55. Â Meh.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,Really enjoyed this place. Got a table for 6 on a Friday with a day-before reservation. We started with some fries. They have about 5 to choose from. Definitely great to start. I got the Maverick burger and it was awesome. Literally left that place knowing I ate too much. Bar scene looked crazy busy too. Definitely would go back. Service was excellent.,The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Came for the monthly pig roast - held the second Sunday of every month. Roast pig, cornbread with melted maple butter, chilled broccoli salad, Velveeta mac + cheese, creamed corn, chopped slaw, Texas toast, and bread and butter pickles - unlimited, all for $25. Included is one free beer from the partner brewery that month. For June it was Otter Creek Brewery.The only downside is the AYCE is served by the tray (see photos), but the kitchen can accommodate and make you a platter with only the sides and parts of the tray you want. Also service was wicked slow which can get in the way of eating all the pork your little heart desires.Overall 3.5/5. Definitely want to come back one day and try their regular menu.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Oh, Gallows...you are sort of becoming my regular when I want to class it up a bit but keep it close. Â While the beer selection isn't as expansive as I would like (I tend to go to Five Horses if I'm looking for a range of beer), this is my first choice if I'm looking for a range of food. Â I'm partial to the fried chicken and poutine, but could be persuaded to explore other things on the menu.My only complaint is that when I sit at the bar (which has been every time I've gone), sometimes the bar staff cares more about interacting with each other than interacting with the patrons (unless they are regulars). Â I haven't dined in the dining room so can't comment on the service there, although the hostesses are always friendly.

Apps and drinks (beer and wine) orders were quickly taken. Everything was amazing. Â Calamari was crisp and delicious as was bruschetta. We all ordered something different from menu and everyone was very happy with choices. Last night we met friends there again for dinner, as expected it was busy, they did fall behind a little at reservation seating but not a problem at all.

We've come here many times before, but haven't seen the current bouncer (young man in his 20s) before. He initially told us it would be a 30-40 min wait, but we ended up waiting 2 hours because he let many parties of the same size in before us even though they arrived later. He was also extremely unprofessional - not only did he never update us on the wait time, but he blatantly pulled out a stack of 20s from his pocket and counted them while standing beside the entrance. I understand that bouncers often take bribes, but this was just ridiculous - they should know how to do it to a reasonable extent. Will not be returning anytime soon.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"I'm so excited to have finally crossed this place off my Boston bucket list. I visited the south end location today and was able to get a reservation about 2 hrs prior to our desired seating time which was awesome ! Upon arriving we were seated quickly and given bread. The location was very small and I felt like I was essentially on top of the people nextto us but the bread was very average & the olive oil and balsamic were really good ! We order a bottle of the $20 chianti and shared an order of calamari which was pretty good and I got the butternut squash ravioli and my boyfriend got the chicken parm. The portions are HUGE. The butternut squash ravioli was creamy and delicious (although it said it had pancetta in it but I didn't see or taste any) and my boyfriend enjoyed his chicken parm. All in all it was a great meal for a good price. Here's my final summary:- great value - not frills or ""instagrammable"" setting - will likely be back but absolutely not worth the 1.5 wait that many other reviewers have endured !!! Capitalize on the south end location allowing reservations!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"** NOTE: CASH ONLY **I'm fortunate that this place is down the street from me as the place can get really crazy come dinner time on the weekends.

Â I went for the lobster ravioli which was quite good. Â The sauce was rich and creamy and there was a decent amount of lobster in each ravioli. Â The price is also quite reasonable for what you get. Â My partner enjoyed her Frutti di Mare as well (though she was disappointed they didn't let her combine the red and white sauce that night). Â The Caesar salad and calamari were quite fresh and delicious. Â No complaints there! Â So far the service and food have been quite consistent for us so we'll keep coming back!

I had the fracamo (fra di avolo + giacomo) frutti de mare and fried mozzarella. A bit on the salty side (i had to drink a ton of water when I got home), but delicious at the moment. Usually has a wait so I recommend making reservations (only the south end location on columbus ave allows reservations), and payment is cash only.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"I first went to Giacomo's on the North End 10 years ago, and I still dream about the seafood pasta in fra diavolo sauce to this year. Â I remember it as the best Italian food I ever had, and even after traveling extensively through Italy in the next few years, I'd never had any pasta I loved as much. So this past trip to Boston I made sure to stop by. Â I didn't realize that there were now 3 Giacomo's in Boston instead of 2, and accidentally set my Google Maps to the South End location instead of the original. I had wondered why the neighborhood changed so much from what I remembered. This location is slightly more expensive but there's a lot more space, so we were seated immediately. I think? they also have AC, or in any case, it felt a lot cooler inside. So I'd say for not having to wait on an especially humid day, it's worth it to come here. We ordered a house salad, which was kind of meh, and the half lobster, clam, mussels fettuccine special in fra diavolo sauce, and the lobster ravioli in Giacomo's sauce. Â We all loved everything. The fettuccine was perfectly chewy, and tasted fresh not made from dried pasta. The sauces were a bit too salty for my liking but still phenomenal. The lobster ravioli surprisingly didn't include cheese, according to our waiter, and just contained chunks of lobster. Even though the portions were huge, we still sopped up the last of the sauce with the generous hunk of bread. Â The wait staff was extremely efficient and very nice as well, keeping our ice water filled and giving us extra plates without us asking. Â Why 4 stars instead of 5? It doesn't quite live up to my memories of my first visit to Giacomo's. I remember the mind-blowing fra diavolo sauce being more watery instead of gloopy as it was here, and not being quite as salty. Â Perhaps I should've visited the original North End location to adequately compare, perhaps my memories just deceive me. Still, this was the best Italian food I've had in years, and you need to stop by if you're ever in Boston.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"I was pleasantly surprised by Giacomo's. All of my friends and coworkers hyped this place up so much that it took me a few years to muster up some semblance of motivation to try it out, and wow am I glad that I did! My date ordered the frutti di mare pasta and I ordered the lobster ravioli. We also ordered a calamari to share.The calamari itself was by far the best I have ever had because it was fried to light, crispety, crunchety perfection. The marinara sauce was also light, not too salty, and actually enhanced the flavor of the calamari instead of masking it like so many other places. I snuck a bite of the frutti di mare and it was very flavorful, but holy cow, the lobster ravioli was perfect. It was a bit al dente but the added texture made the dish more interesting. The sauces were incredible all around and I'm already planning my next date night at Giacomo's!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1,"Great food ruined by their cash only policy. Nearest OPEN atm was 0.5 miles away. Had to leave my wife in the restaurant while I ran a mile to get more cash (now I feel like I'm going to puke). It's 2018, I can pay for things by waving my phone in the air, accept credit cards for goodness sake.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"We're from out of town and this place was recommended by a local. Â Great food, huge portions. Â The calamari was really light and tender, mozzarella sticks were huge, and all our pasta entrees were excellent. Â We had pea and prosciutto linguini, seafood fusilli, and butternut squash ravioli. Â Compared to other reviews our service was really good, so maybe it just matters who you get. Â Cash only, so be prepared! Â The wine list is really inexpensive, so we were pleased to get a Rosso Di Montalcino for $37. Â Final thing to take note of, this place is LOUD!!!

I was surprised that I able to secure a booking for a table for two even though I called only hours before dinner time on a weekday. The fruitti di mare: Quite delicious. I went with the nonspicy red sauce( the other two red sauces are spicy). The clams and mussels pasta: a tad too oily Ambiance: cramped and the noise level was very high. Tables were close to each together. This is how I would rank the seafood pasta I have tasted in Boston so far: 1. Fruitti di mare at Carmelina's ($27.82)2. Lobster fra diavolo at Daily Catch ($69, for 2 persons) 3. Fruitti di mare ( nonspicy red sauce) at Giacomo's ($21)4. linguine alla pascatore at Panza ($16)5. Lobster roe pasta at Island Creek Oyster Bar ($38)",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"I've been to the north end location once and loved the food. I've been meaning to go back but tend to avoid the north end because of the lack of parking and long lines. I am so glad I discovered the south end location since this one takes reservations! The restaurant is small and tables are places very close together which became slightly annoying when I had to get up from my seat 4 times for the people at the table next to me to get in and out. Despite the tight space here, it is actually bigger than their north end location. I was seated promptly and immediately knew what I was going to order (the same dish I got last time). It was the house special: seafood pasta for 2 for $65. This is the most expensive dish on the menu but it is huge and delicious! You choose your own sauce; I decided on the fracomo sauce. The sauce is a bit runny and I tend to like thicker creamier sauces but it was still delicious. You can easily split this dish between 3 people and the seafood is plenty! You get a whole lobster split into two sides, clams, scallops, mussels, squid, and shrimp. I'm glad that after a few years passed before coming back that they haven't downsized this dish or raised the price. I definitely satisfied my Italian craving by visiting this restaurant!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Oh Giacomo's you have won my heart. I've been to this location and their other location in the North End and the major difference between the two is whether you want to line up for 2.5 hours (North End location) or not. As much as I love the anticipation in waiting for delicious pasta, I opted for the Back Bay location this time around since they allow reservations and I had a large party. My group of 8 ALL loved their dish. From the calamari (the best I've had in a while -- the crunch factor was perfect, it was fresh, and the salsa dip they gave was the perfect pairing), the garlic bread, and my favourite go to order, linguine + clam + scampi, I was so satisfied, everyone was satisfied, and it did not break my bank.Whenever someone comes to visit Boston I always recommend Giacomo's because I think it's the best introduction to all the great Italian food Boston has to offer.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Food was delicious!!! :) we went out with friends on a Saturday night- it was pretty busy but we had reservations... be prepared for a wait if you haven't made reservations. Their butternut squash ravioli is amazing and they were nice enough to make it vegetarian! Service is great- a little slow but that can be excused because the place was packed. Only negatives- the place is very loud and also, it's cash only. The vegetarian options are limited on the menu but they were friendly enough to modify the food such that it is vegetarian! So definitely worth a visit if you're in Boston!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"3,"I feel like the north end location was slightly better, but it may just time softening my view of the food. In any case, this south end location has two major advantages: location and reservations. It's still cash only though.The swordfish and tuna in the pesto cream sauce with fettuccini (17$) was okay. The fettuccini was predictably good, the sauce was too heavy for my taste (super oily), and the swordfish/tuna chunks were kind of average. The Zuppo di Pesce (65$/two people) is essentially all the seafood in their choose-your-own-linguine with the addition of lobster. As a result, it's much more expensive than getting two of the choose-your-own-linguine options. It's quite tasty, and their linguine remains very good. However, the sauce (fracomo, one that I've had at the north end location) was super watery and as a result, didn't stick to the linguine very well. This was pretty disappointing. The lobster is also really annoying to eat when covered in sauce and the some of the clam shells had shattered in the dish. Honestly, I'd go for the regular choose-your-own linguine options over this, which is what I'll do when I go back",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"This place is perfection! It never disappoints! This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Boston, of all time. Â The south end location is the only one of the locations that takes reservations (The North End and Melrose do not). Â Call ahead for a reservation, and if you're willing to eat at 5pm when they first open, get a reservation for that time. Otherwise, even with a reservation, plan to wait (pro tip: the bar next door has amazing truffle fries!).It's worth the wait! The service is always spot on (attentive but not smothering). Â The wine by the bottle is SO reasonable (most are $21/bottle). Â The food is always fresh and great quality and cooked to perfection. I've never had a bad meal here ever. Â Even the coffee at the end of the meal is AMAZING.

Giacomo's has become my favorite restaurant in Boston, by far. This time I got the Chicken Parm and my girlfriend once again got the Butternut Squash Ravioli which she absolutely RAVES about even when we're not in town. I wish we lived closer because I'd probably eat here once or twice a month if we did. The Chicken Parm was equally amazing and rates up there with some of the best I've had. The beer here is cheap compared to Boston prices, $4 for a bottle of Peroni and some other selections. Wine is $6/glass and they fill it to the top, great value in all their prices in my opinion. I can't wait til my next trip to eat here again!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"3,"I'd heard amazing things about the North End location, so we decided to bring some guests to this location since they take reservations. We did have to wait around 30 minutes after our reservation, but I understood since the restaurant is very cozy. It's also quite loud, but it does give off the North End vibe although it's in a normal part of South End. We also loved the manager, who was super funny and welcoming. Our waitress was quite slow (I think it may have been her first day) and we waited a while to order. Once we did order, the food came out in a normal manner (I'm guessing/hoping they freshly cook everything, so we didn't mind too much!). The table bread was mediocre, as was the actual pasta. I ordered the dia frialo pasta (linguine with mussels, shrimp, clams, etc). The seafood was plentiful and shrimp was especially tasty, and the sauce was delectable . However, the pasta itself wasn't cooked al dente; I also tried the butternut squash ravioli and was not blown away either. We ordered caprese salad, and it was just normal as well (tomato was exceptionally bland).",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Go Early!The North End is one of my favorite places to go out to eat in Boston.

I've ordered a beer along with a meal and they served Â the meal faster than brought us a beer. Actually, As it appeared twenty minutes later, they forgot to mention they ran out of beer and they didn't even ask us if we wanted something else. Ok, I can accept the fact that when we finally got our 'substitution', the waiter charged for one drink instead of two drinks due to that awkward Â moment.

We were able to get seated by the window with sunbeams shining on our table. I ordered a glass of white wine and we got the Mom's Meatballs and Ricotta to start. The meatball was quite good and I loved that they served up a cool, refreshing ricotta; however, the ricotta had a truffle-y essence to it and that was not listed in the menu and it caught my tastebuds by surprise. I'm not sure if this was intentional or maybe some carryover from something made or a utensil used before. I enjoy truffle to a certain degree but I personally cannot handle to much of it and am surprised they don't mention it as some people entirely dislike truffle.. The ricotta cream was still good, but just beware of the truffle flavor sneaking up on you in certain bites.The Boy got the Spaghetti Carbonara (of course) and I got the Paccheri al RagÃº. The Boy loved the pancetta in his pasta but found something to be desired in the sauce; it coated the spaghetti well but left little extra at the bottom of the pan - a little too thick/full for his liking. My ragu - essentially a meat sauce (lamb, beef, veal, & pork) - was outstanding. I did think the rigatoni could be cooked a smidgen longer as it was chewier than I liked it to be. I took leftovers home and reheating it cooked the pasta to just the way I liked it.Service was great and I really enjoyed the lunch ambiance. Trattoria's menu is pretty standard Italian fare for the North End and will serve you all the classics you're looking for.

I highly recommend coming here for lunch because the outside patio is lovely during nice weather. It feels like you've been transported to another place. Trattoria il Panino has two locations; we ate at the location off of Hanover, so it felt more private. The food was amazing. All the pastas are fresh and such an amazing texture and flavor. I ordered the pesto and you could tell that it was made in house. The portion was so generous, I had to take most of it home! My friend ordered the lasagna of the day; I had a bite and it was one of the best lasagnas I've had. It had so many layers and was stuffed with meat and covered in cheese. Service was awesome.

Â This location (they may be connected in the kitchen, I don't know), is a completely covered patio open to the street.The first time I had lunch here, the food was decent, nothing special, and service was fine, although a bit clueless (how many different servers can ask you what you want to order?).The second time, on a Thursday around lunchtime, I stopped in for a glass of wine while waiting for a friend. Â The staff member who greeted me refused to seat me in the 2/3rds empty restaurant unless I ordered food. Â Well that's fine, as restaurants have policies (and they are just around the corner from a restaurant which has a long line and I'm sure they don't want to fill up with people just wanting a glass of wine until their tables open up at Neptune lol). Â But the server mumbled a very dismissive reply to me (young guy with black hair, accent and scruffy beard), which I thought was quite rude. Â How about smiling, looking me in the face and saying, ""I'm sorry but...""?Obviously, you don't need me as a repeat customer. Â I'll go to Daily Catch or Carmelina's instead...",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Came here for restaurant week, but ended up opting for the normal menu. We were seated on the side near the stairs (had to walk through the whole restaurant and passed the kitchen to get here). Apparently this is the same restaurant, but it is different in terms of the liquor license?? It'd be great if someone could clarify. I wanted to order a HIGHLY-HYPED espresso martini, but I couldn't because they could only serve beer or wine on our side. Interesting rule, but just a heads up if you're sitting in this area. The food was delicious though, which made up for this silly rule. I ordered the lobster ravioli in a crab meat sauce. My friends ordered the chicken parm, spaghetti carbonara, and fruitti de mare. All of the above were delicious. I loved the skillets, so the food stays hot. The prices were also very reasonable considering we were in the North End. Unless you want something very heavy, I'd refrain from ordering the carbonara and the lobster ravioli. The crab meat sauce is THICK. This place is also open till 2am, so need I say anymore? I can't imagine you getting higher quality drunchies anywhere else (besides salt and pepper squid in Chinatown).",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Overall - Trattoria Il Panino is a nice place for dinner where you'll surely have left overs. They serve the food in pans, I'm guessing the food is cooked in these though not sure since the pan doesn't arrive that hot.The food - I've had a some of their pasta dishes as well as their meatball appetizers. One of my favorite things about this place is the meatball app. Though it is a little bit on the pricier side, the meatballs are delicious! The meat is perfectly cooked and has flavor in it of itself. The meatballs come with a lot of sauce that is so tasty! The sauce is thick and perfectly seasoned with a dash of basil and a side of some fresh tasting ricotta. My two favorite pasta dishes here are the gnocchi and clam pasta. I don't tend to order gnocchi as I find it too heavy but this is the exception. The sauce that the gnocchi comes with is really good and very creamy with some fresh cheese pieces on top. The clam pasta is lighter and just as tasty with some zest to it.The place - it can certainly get a little packed, especially during the weekends. The first time I came here was on a Sunday and I had to wait, though not for long. This latest visit was on a weekday night and they had spots at the bar which we chose to take. The place is large and it can get a bit loud at times, though nothing crazy. Inside it's a bit dark but if you're lucky to get a seat near the windows it makes for a good bright spot and great location for people watching.Definitely would recommend and would be back!",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"5,"My mom and I went here while she was visiting me in town. I have been to many North End Italian restaurants, but this one is definitely one of my favorites to go to. We went during lunch around 1pm and they sat us right away. The area we sat was not particularly big, but I believe there are more rooms dedicated to the restaurant. Â Our waitress was friendly, and so was the rest of the staff. They made nice side conversations and were very helpful.I ordered the Ravioli Porcini, and my mom ordered the Paccheri al RagÃº. My food was absolutely amazing. It came out decently quick and it was so rich in flavor. The portion size was just enough for me. I finished the whole dish, but that also could be because I loved it so much! Overall, it was a great experience. I will certainly be coming back here soon.",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"4,"First time in Boston. If I ever come back, I'll definitely be visiting this restaurant again!The location on Parmenter seemed to be a little Â more compact than the Hanover location but Maria was very accommodating in getting us seated when they couldn't locate our reservation I made over the phone.The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about the dishes. Every dish we got at our table was amazing!",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Took my wife here for lunch day we were leaving Boston on business and I regret not being able to come back for dinner! THE BEST Lasagna I have ever had and they have Gluten Free pasta (for my wife). UHmazing food amd presentation and the owner ""Maria"" treats you like family!!!",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"4,"After hearing my colleague and friend rave about the lobster ravioli dish for months, I finally made it out here - with her, of course.The coolest parts? Your dish is served in a pan.They don't skimp on the lobster; you get actual, large pieces of lobster within each ravioli!For a North End restaurant, with a beautiful ambience, and a lobster dish, the price is super reasonable.I can't wait to return - and though I should probably try something new -let's be real.I'm getting the Ravioli Con Aragosta and I'm going to love it.",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Dropped in here for drinks and dinner with some old friends. I'm surprised I've never stopped in here before!We had wine and settled on sharing four appetizers - which ended up being more food than the three of us could handle. We had the calamari (crispy and tasty fried seafood, but nothing special), the Shrimp al limoncello (GET THIS - four huge shrimp in the most wonderful garlic sauce you've had - you will be sopping up the leftover sauce with bread and dying of happiness), Mama's meatball (two tender delicious meatballs with a generous dollop of ricotta), and the mozzarella special (so soft a light on the inside, yum!). The waiters were friendly and kept track of you glass remaining full. Minus one start for pricing. $14-16 per appetizer is a bit high for what you're getting, even in the North end.",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"5,"All I can say is WOW! When it comes to food quality this is at the very top of my list for Italian! I thought I've had amazing pizza before, but after eating their Half Bronx Bomber and Half Fig & Prosciutto Pizza I was wrong. This is BY FAR the best pizza I have had and that says a lot for someone who eats as much pizza as I do! We also tried the Old School Tuscan Bolognese Pasta which was deemed the BEST pasta EVER by my fiancÃ© ! The ambiance was nice as casual and located on a great spot in Beacon Hill. If you get a seat next to the window, you will have a great view of Beacon Hill. The price was a little above average, I spent about $54 on two people but have plenty of food left over for later! This could have easily fed 3 people. Overall, this place is highly recommended ! Try it and you won't regret it!**This review was based on trying this place more than 2 times. I believe in trying a place multiple times before reviewing in order to give an honest and fair review.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"A friend gave me a gift card to Figs so we made our way there to check out the pizza. Located on Charles Street in Beacon Hill, it's narrow but cozy inside and it's a nice, casual spot to grab a pie. We had a reservation, which I would recommend given the popularity of this place, and we were seated quite quickly. As we looked over the menu, it was clear by observing the tables around us that the turnaround time was pretty short from ordering to getting the food to the table.Given the name, I assumed that the fig and prosciutto pizza was the most popular one but our waiter indicated that Red Sox with his favorite. It had tomato sauce, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, mozzarella, Italian sausage, and a lemon aioli drizzle. I was skeptical about the sauce as I don't typically like a lot of sauce on my food, and definitely not topping my pizza. But, this actually worked quite well. The pizza was so flavorful and well seasoned, from the meat to the red sauce, to the veggies on top. We opted to split the pie with half Red Sox and half Bronx Bomber, which was essentially cheese pizza topped with pepperoni and basil. Pepperoni pizza is a classic so it was great to try their version of it. Large pieces of deli sliced pepperoni topped the mozzarella cheese. The crust was thin but it remained crispy, particularly under the Red Sox portion.Pizzas are primarily between $20 and $25. They also offer appetizers that are hearty such as chicken parmesan sliders and meatball sliders, as well as salads, pasta dishes, entrees, and a few sides. We tried the garlic, rosemary and parmesan fries, which were very underwhelming with packaged parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and whole sprigs of rosemary. We did not detect any garlic, salt, or pepper, all of which those fries needed.The service was swift and adequate but certainly not overly friendly. The efficiency was good here. I could see this being a great place to call in an order for pick up if you lived in the area, or to grab a quick bite for a weekend lunch or a casual dinner.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"1,"I disliked:- I was naive and trusted the reviews, I dislike myself for this- calamari appetizer is fried and was disgusting; it has no calamari, just dough to make you full; it's a giant portion so don't get fooled by quantity because you're not eating calamari, they are trying to distract you with quantity - pizzas were so lame; cheese tasted like rubber, figs were overpowering the pizza, way too sweet- way too loud, you gotta be drunk to enjoy the atmosphere - slow serviceI think the only reason this place has good reviews is because people are drunk here or cheap and just wanna have lots of food, coming in groups and sharing the plates. So if you're cheap or coming in a group that is cheap and you don't care about quality, you might enjoy it.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Visiting Boston for only a few days, I knew I had to try this place due to favorable recommendations by friends. We arrived without a reservation, so we had no expectations to be seated promptly. Â The wait time for our party of three was approximately 15-20 minutes during non peak hours which was slightly longer than expected despite many open tables being available for parties of 2. Â  The service was very professional, the ambiance was inviting, prices were reasonable but the Bronx Bomber pizza was just ok. Â The toppings were fresh but they were overshadowed by the slightly burnt Â pepperonis (pics). Overall I did enjoy our lunch, but make reservations first.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"I celebrated my birthday with my best friend by having lunch at Figs on a Friday. We made reservations for 1pm but came about 20 minutes late, which didn't end up being a problem since there was ample seating. Figs does gourmet pizza alongside other Italian/America entrees. If you and your party can't pick between two types of pizza, the best part is you can half of each. We ordered fries with parmesan, rosemary, and roasted garlic to start. At $8, I was expecting more than just ingredients thrown on top, but perhaps we just assumed there was going to be truffle or another type of oil to help things stick on more. Overpriced and not very worth it, considering parmesan is offered on the table. For pizza, we chose half figs and prosciutto and half red sox. The figs and prosciutto pizza is amazing! Definitely a pleasant and surprisingly delicious combo of crisp rosemary crust with fig and balsamic jam, prosciutto, and gorgonzola cheese. The red sox was a little soggier, still good but not particularly noteworthy. The pizza does get cold fast, so eat quickly! Overall, Figs is a good dining option if you're going to be in the Beacon Hill area, but unsure if I would come out of my way here again. Still highly recommend the figs and prosciutto pizza!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Figs has some of the best speciality pizzas in Boston! It is a fairly small space in Beacon Hill but the wait is never too long for a table for two.Every time I come here (about once a month) I have trouble deciding which pizza to get. Usually I share a salad to start, the Greek salad is delicious, then get a pizza split halfway between two types.My favorites are the arugula with tomatoes and the crispy eggplant but you can't go wrong with any choice on the menu.The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable and the waitstaff is very friendly. Figs is one of my favorite spots not only in Beacon Hill but in all of Boston and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,This square pizza will definitely make you question all other traditionally-round ones.

I highly recommend the crispy eggplant pizza.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"A yummy meal that can get a bit greasy! If you're on any sort of diet, prepare to wreck it if you're at Figs!My friend and I came right at noon on a Sunday and I'm super glad we did. When we left around 1pm, the place was packed and there were even people waiting outside. If you're gonna come for lunch, come right when they open at noon! We ordered the pizza with 2 different halves: Prosciutto + Fig on one side and the Red Sox on the other. The Prosciutto was hands down the winner and next time I'm just gonna get the entire thing with prosciutto. It's a beautiful combo of generous prosciutto slices with fig pieces, all lovingly drizzled with olive oil. Yum!! It does get a bit oily though so be warned it's a messy slice! Also the pizza is more like a flat bread than what I would traditionally think is a pizza. If you're a thin, soft crust kinda person, you'll be super happy here! We also ordered a side of Brussels Sprouts with butter and pancetta. Delicious and super rich! Seriously butter makes everything taste heavenly so brace yourself for some very decadent bites! Overall, it was a super tasty meal! Between the 2 of us, we actually had pizza leftover because the portions were quite generous. I'll def be back - but only for the Prosciutto!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"This place is AMAZING. The ambiance was intimate and cozy, location is great, the employees are friendly and make excellent suggestions and the food... well it is phenomenal. For a group of four the waiter recommended we split two salads, two appetizers, and a pizza... and that is exactly what we did. The salads were unique and tangy but i would highly recommend trying the chicken parm sliders. They were great! As for the pizza, we did half and half of the fig & prosciutto and the Red Sox pizza. Both were out of this world amazing. They serve the pizza on a large cookie tray and the presentation is quite impressive. The pizza had a really unique flavor and as a born and raised New Yorker (s/o to the best pizza in the world) even I was impressed by it. Will definitely return just for the fig and prosciutto pizza!!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,I love Figs! I live in Beacon Hill so I do take out often. They are fast so make sure to head there after ordering because the pizza does get cold sitting there. I've had a few of the pizzas. You can split the pizza and get two types. My favorite is the calamari. You get an insane amount of calamari to cover the pizza. I was hesitant about the lemon aioli at first because I prefer my calamari with plain lemon and marinara sauce - but the lemon aioli really makes the pizza. It is super crispy and delicious. Best when eaten at Figs. Another one of my favorites is the crispy eggplant. I wish there was a little more ricotta cheese to help balance the pizza. The egg plant is very crispy and makes a great topping to a classic pizza. I've had the Red Sox pizza but didn't love the mustard aioli on that. I think it would have been better without it. Â If you order a pizza online there's no where to tell them to split the pizza with two types of toppings. I just call in and tell them how to edit the order. They charge you for the most expensive pizza if you split it.,Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"I am sooo happy this location has reopened after the fire, since Figs has long occupied a special place in my heart (and my stomach). Â Their uniquely topped, free form, thin crust pizzas are part of my childhood, and I just love them more and more each time I have the opportunity to chow down on them. Â I think I prefer the Charlestown location, since the more central Beacon Hill spot gets very noisy and crowded, making for a slightly more stressful dining experience (claustrophobes beware!), but it's still so worth it for me. Â They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait up to an hour during peak times. Â Given the tiny size of the restaurant, this often means waiting outside, so checking the weather forecast before committing is not a bad idea. But despite these caveats, if you do go through the rigmarole of getting in and getting a table you will be well-rewarded with delicious pizza creations at surprisingly reasonable prices. Â My favorites are the Oliver's (traditional tomato, basil, mozzarella), the fig and prosciutto (w/balsamic jam and gorgonzola), and the Isabelle's (country ham, provolone, asparagus, sweet onion, eggs), but there are many more great options. Â They do half-and-half pizzas as well, so you can really maximize your flavor sampling.Maybe my history with the place have given me a bias, but they have never disappointed me in all the years I've been going to their three (now two) locations.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,Best pizza I've had in years. Â A true gem! Â The service is outstanding as well. Â Highly recommend to locals and visitors!,Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Came here on a snowy night for a brew and some pizza and it was hands down the best pizza I've ever had! Granted I don't eat it all too often, but my girlfriend who is a pizza fiend agreed! I prefer my pizza to be thin and crispy, so this was spot on. This will definitely be our go-to spot for when we're feeling lazy. The space is small, but very cozy. If there's no tables available when you arrive, looks like your only option would be to wait outside (not bad if it's nice out, not fun if it's cold!)Side note -- we sat at the bar and the stools were hands down the most uncomfortable thing I've ever sat on. I chose to stand they were so uncomfortable. Would highly suggest getting a table.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"I think this is my new dining place every time I make it to Boston.I haven't tried anything else but the pizza because they are just amazing. Especially if you are indecisive are you are a party of two, you can go 50/50 which is very good for your wallet. In general, the pizza is too big for one person but way too good to not take it. Perfect crust, gourmet toppings you can't find anywhere else AND wood-fired!The place runs packed every night and reservation is encouraged. I'm mostly able to squeeze myself in at the bar but if you are more than two, make sure to make a rezzy.I know these words aren't taken lightly here but: might be the best pizza in Boston!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,Highly recommend.

Would definitely come back for other flavors!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"First real restaurant meal in Boston.. and i loved it! The restaurant in extremely tiny, not conducive to large groups at all... but it's tiny in a warm and cozy type of way. Perfect for me as I came by myself. There were only two servers here and since the tiny place is packed out (every seat taken, couple people standing at door waiting), there's a little bit of a wait in ordering/getting food/ etc. But they're clearly working hard, so I didn't mind. Bread and olive oil come out first, and you can tell it's fresh baked bread. I ordered a couple of strange sounding things just to have a culinary adventure: 1. Cauliflower Bisque - perfectly creamy with some golden raisins, a bit of parmesan cheese, a pesto drizzle, and some croutons. Sounds weird, WAS weird, but also really really good! 2. Fig and Prosciutto pizza - some kind of fig jam type stuff (instead of marinara sauce), and large slices of prosciutto, with an EVOO drizzle. Yall... I'm weird about pizza because I'm not a fan of a thick or doughy crust.. This was the PERFECT crust for thin crust lovers of the world! Super thin, but it held up perfectly under the topping and had the perfect crunch too! The pizza was HUGE. Everyone else who ordered a lizza is sharing one among the whole table. I got weird looks getting one for just me. After the soup I could only manage to eat two slices.. the rest is going home with me!Anywho - If you're around Charles Street in Boston, Figs is worth a stop!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Let me just tell you about their bread. I don't know what kind of bread it was. I think it was onion bread, but it was moist and sooo tasty! My friends ordered the Tuscan Pizza and I ordered the Spaghetti Pomodoro with Tuscan meatballs. The meatballs melted in my mouth and the spaghetti was bouncy and perfectly cooked. I could not recommend this place enough. The prices were a bit high, but I am unfamiliar with the prices of Boston. The area that this place is located in is so adorable too so it is worth stopping by. We strolled through the Boston Commons and ended up finding this place! I would definitely recommend bringing a couple people so you can share entrees and try more than one thing!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"I went here for a birthday dinner and I'm surprised how well they were able to accommodate such a big party for a Friday night. I believe my friend did make reservations so that definitely helped. This reminds of the MD restaurant in Allston, which the similar theme of Korean style food and large TVs with Korean pop music. The only difference is that there's a live dj and pretty much this place turns into a wonder bar in Allston but down the Fenway area instead. I have to say the food is soo good though, honestly I think I prefer it over MD. Way more flavorful and a lot more variety. Foods:Crunchy corn - basically sweet corn kernels mixed in some kind of fried breading. Reminds me of the corn pop cereal Cheesy corn - Korean delicacy app, basically half and half mixed with melted cheese and mixed corn. The only con to it is that if you don't eat it fast enough, the cheese hardens and it gets hard!

I stopped by recently to catch up with some friends, after hearing good things about Sojuba.The inside is large and pretty clean, with lots of colorful lights. They play a mix of house/dance, K-hip hop and K-pop, and top 40. You can request songs as well. One of the servers has a soft spot for BTS Â which I appreciated a lot. Later at night, the lower floor is cleared of tables and turned into a dance floor.The three of us ordered army base stew and a small soy miso fried chicken. The stew is good comfort food, but a little salty for my taste. There's rice cakes on the bottom of it, so eat accordingly! The fried chicken is crispy and flavorful. Get beer if you order the chicken for the full fried chicken/beer experience. The imported Korean beers are a bit pricey, so the Sapporo is probably the best bang for your buck. The food in general seems pretty legit, so it was quite tasty.I'll be back! Lots of tables ordered the watermelon drink (perfect for big groups in the summer), and I have yet to try the Melona cocktail.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"3,"This was my first time at SOJUba and it was a fun experience. My friends and I went for dinner and ordered bibimbop, bulgogi, seafood cake, and udon. I was mostly gravitated towards their soju cocktails because they had ones that I'ved never tried. The hostess helped us grab a table quick. She told us it would be a 20 min wait, but it ended up being 5-10 minutes. We appreciated that since we were really hungry. The waitress helping us was really nice too and gave us our food as fast as she could. The food was alright. I was surprised that the bulgogi was spicy. We were really shocked and ate carefully. The bibimbop was good too, but smaller than I imagined. It's small enough for one person to eat.We ordered aloe and yogurt soju cocktails by the pitcher. I would think that I would of been at least buzzed, but I think the ice watered it down. I don't encourage it, but it seems like next time I have to drink it quick once I order it. Overall, the drinks were good.The atmosphere is like a night club scene. There were lights flashing and K-pop music playing loudly. I loved it because it made it more exciting for us since we weren't expecting it. They also have sparklers for people's birthdays.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"I'm SO glad I had the chance to try Sojuba! My boyfriend and I arrived for dinner on a Tuesday night around 7:30 PM. There was no line and plenty of space since it wasn't Friday or Saturday night. It has a very club-esque environment, complete withâ€‹ flashy, swirly lights, k-pop music videos playing on screen (and the Red Sox game), lounge-yâ€‹ seating, and a bar.We started with their soju drinks- I had the aloe soju and my boyfriend tried the screw bar soju. I loved the aloe bits in my drink! It was a good combination of boozy and sweet (and nostalgic- I LOVE aloe!). The screw bar soju came with a glass of beer and a shot of liquor. For food, we shared the:- Spicy fried chicken- we chose their small size, so it came with eight pieces (in total) of wings and drumsticks. It was super spicy, so I was only able to eat one drumstick. The sauce they used was plentiful, flavorful, and packed a lot of heat. The outside was slightly crispy and the inside was tender.- Dok Bokghi- it was a favorite at the table! It consisted of tender rice cakes, assorted vegetables, and fishcakes drenched in a spicy-sweet sauce. The sauce contained a perfect amount of heat and was so savory. The portion is on the smaller side.- Kalbi Tang- we thought a beef stew would be a good way to conclude the meal, and it was! This dish consisted of a rich beef broth, vermicelli noodles, scallions, and short ribs (less of the meat, more of the bone). I was really surprised by the broth because it looked watered down, but taste-wise, it wasn't! It paired nicely with the side of rice they provided. :- ) I would've liked more vermicelli noodles to enjoy with the broth.Our servers were super sweet and attentive throughout the night! I had a wonderful experience here and would love to come back sometime!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"Where do I start? If you're looking for a place with good food, good vibes, good music. You don't have to look any further. I've been here on numerous occasions and like last night, it was an absolute blast.Made a reservation for a very large party and they were really accommodating with such a short notice. Weekends are usually pretty packed so I would recommend calling way ahead of time to be on the safe side. Our waitress Tristine and the rest of the staff went above and beyond with making sure that all of us were taken care of with whatever we needed. We ordered literally everything on the menu from Korean wings to bimbimbop. Key to most peoples hearts starts with good food and Sojuba doesn't disappoint. They have an outdoor patio that's nice and chill to hang out or just enjoy dinner. The atmosphere can be loud with lights and different decor on the walls. Music ranges from Korean hip hop to Edm but song requests can be made. If you're trying to have a slightly more chill vibe, make your way up to the bar upstairs which has small booths along the wall for you and your friends. I'd definitely recommend Sojuba and can't wait my next visit. Parking can be tricky but there is a parking lot right next door that is only $10 on weekends.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"This would be a really good place to visit on the weekends! The inside is huge, and there are many TV screens around the place playing Kpop videos. The interior is also decorated nicely with lights and disco balls. The servers were incredibly nice as well. We got the boodae jungol, which came with ramen, tofu, vegetables, rice cakes, sausage, and spam in a spicy soup base. It came on top a stove so it was hot throughout dinner. The fried chicken was also pretty good (the original flavor was good but the other ones with sauce are probably better).",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"Came here with a few friends for dinner on a weekday night, so it wasn't crowded or busy yet. The staff informed us that the cook was stuck in traffic, so we could only order drinks if we wanted. We waited around and took our time deciding what we wanted to get. We decided to order the soy garlic wings, fried squid, and the kimchi dumpling hot pot soup. I also got the melon soju and my friend got the screwbar soju. The food is pretty good, the chicken was crunchy but nothing too special. Our hot pot soup was piping hot and all the ingredients got mixed in well to make a delicious tasting stew. I preferred the screwbar soju over the melon soju since it's much sweeter and honestly just tastes like juice. I'd recommend trying it if you have a sweet tooth! The servers were great, always checking in with us, but gave us space to catch up over dinner. The drinks were on the house, since we waited a while for the chef to show up, which we really appreciated being compensated for our time. This is a great addition to the Fenway area for food and drinks.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"Apologies to Myung Dong on Harvard Ave but Sojuba is taking over as the Korean bar to go to in Boston. The menu is more extensive, albeit not any cheaper. The food quality is more restaurant than bar, which is enough to convince me to ""trek"" to Fenway. The cocktails are my style aka lemon soju cocktail tastes solely of lemonade. They also have a variety of Korean and American beer. The outdoor patio basically seals the deal and makes this non-bar person a fan of Sojuba. The one missing star is the music. I'm squarely in the korean music camp. I've been here a couple times and the music is more American on weekend nights, so for Korean music, basically have to go pre-8pm. Which is probably for the better of my wallet; otherwise, I'd be here every weekend. For food, I've had the budae jungol (army stew for two) - really beats out any other army stew I've had at a bar. There's tons of tofu, spam, ramen, all the delicious things. I'm willing to have this spicy pot in the summer. The stir-fried spicy squid is a perfect bar dish with chewy squid and thin wheat noodles to mix in. This place also has my favorite pajeon/scallion pancake, super crispy not too chewy. I haven't really like soondae/blood sausage before, but the soondae makes their soondae bokum a go to order. The ttobokki is decently spicy but not overwhelming, would love to get the ramyun ttobokki next time. The service is generally nice and friendly. They get a little overwhelmed as a new bar with a lot of real estate to cover and therefore potential for some things to slip through the cracks, but I think I've seen the owner will step in a take an order as needed, which is great to see. Overall, I've been impressed with the food, drinks, and service, so I'll be back soon enough.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"I've had my fair share of Korean cuisine in the area, as our city is certainly well represented if you're looking for a Korean fix. But Sojuba fills a void I never even knew existed...Korean lounge. Sojuba sits on prime real estate in always busy Fenway. TV's, DJ booth, speakers blasting Kpop, and plenty of alcohol. This is certainly nothing like the many traditional sit down family Korean restaurants you'll find nearby. It's hip, its young, it's cool, and it's absolutely delicious. I'd recommend the scallion pancakes, fried rice, and of course Korean fried chicken. The glass noodles (or clear) are also quite satisfying. I wouldn't exactly say I am fond of Korean cuisine. It's certainly not my go to, but when a certain Korean everything 'obsessed' Â family member comes into town, I already know what I'll be having....for the entire week.... Thank you Sojuba for helping end my week on a high note. Easily the most pleasant Korean experience I've had to date, and that's including LA Korea town.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"The place to be if you're looking to drink soju, eat and have a good time. Music is good, the venue provides a lounge setting. My friends (group of 3) came on a Thursday night - 10:30ish and the place was sha-poppin'! Sojuba was packed, including the bar area. We got on the wait listed and ordered a watermelon soju at the bar. While waiting for the drink, we were able to be seated at a table. The watermelon soju literally came in a watermelon (refer to all the instagramable pics in the picture section of this business page). Cotton candy was included with the drink which I thought was pretty unique. We met the owners and they were great hosts. I noticed they stopped by each table and knew a lot of their customers. I love that they make sure you're having a good time. Steve taught us a couple of drinking games which added to the fun. Good vibes, good drinks and I'm sure they have good eats. Check them out!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"3,True rating is 3.5. Sojuba (also called Jyuba??) Is like the Myung Don 1st Ave of Fenway. Theres a good food selection in addition to cocktails and loud Kpop. I was disappointed that they do not offer traditional side dishes like most korean restaurants do!I also ordered the tofu soup which was good in quantity! Taste was expected but nothing remarkable. I really wanted to try their popsicle cocktails but I couldn't justify spending $10 on it considering I could buy 2 boxes of melona and soju for nearly the same price.,Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"My friend and I came here on a Friday night for drinks. Music was bumpin' a lot harder than we expected upon arrival. It was about 9pm. Tables were filled. Since we only came for drinks, we ended up taking a couple seats at the bar. I regret not getting the bartender's name because he was pleasant all night. He greeted us right away and handed us food and drink menus. We opted for the corn cheese appetizer (WHICH WAS SPECTACULAR!!!) and a couple melona ice cream soju cocktails. We got yogurt soju cocktails during our second round. Everything was wonderful. The melona ice cream soju was fun and delicious, but I LOVED LOVED LOVED the yogurt soju. The yogurt soju is slightly carbonated, which added (and very subtly) a little extra. I'm also glad we decided to sit at the bar. It was a show watching the bartenders prepare all the cocktails.There was a DJ, who was energetic and friendly. He worked the mic especially when leading birthday songs to patrons at tables. Music choice included radio hits and, for the lack of a better term, ratchet rap and hip-hop. Still, it was fun. Come with couple friends or group. Don't come with your mama.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"3,It was supposed to be a 30-40 minutes wait but ended up being about an hour. The vibe is nice though and they play music videos so the wait wasn't TOO BAD but still lol. Flavored soju is $13 there and the food is actually okay. The kimchi pancake was crispy on the edges but also soft on the inside and had a good amount of spice in it. The fried rice thing was really good it almost tasted creamy but I like that a lot. Had a lot of flavors and wasn't bland! It's just really loud and so it's not that intimate and when we got to our table I almost drank out of a cup that was used and I guess wasn't taken away. It had lipstick stains on it.,Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"Based on a spontaneous solo visit one day and then a visit with my crew weeks later, I have to say Sojuba is a pretty cool place. This place is definitely very much a Korean bar through and through and delivers in that regard well. The alcohol is definitely where Sojuba shines as the Melona soju cocktail and the Screwbar soju cocktail were both refreshing and were fairly smooth. (Plus you get a popsicle). Regarding the food, the fish roe stew wasn't particularly filling and generally only had fish roe and fish cake. Gizzards are a workout for your mouth with a tough, chewy texture that may not be for everyone. (I tried it out of curiosity). The dumplings were ok but didn't really stand out. Â However, the service was on point with Tristine being a pleasure to have as my group's waitress and she accommodated our needs well throughout the night. Usually, I am indifferent about the music in a restaurant but Sojuba earns major points for blasting Kpop that I ended up shazaming and started listening to. (Training Zombie by New Champ is one of my new favorite pump up songs). They do switch to more American music here and there, but you can also request for different songs that you like (another brownie point there). Overall, if you are ready to get turnt with soju to the tune of the latest Kpop or Korean trap, this is the place in Boston to visit. Â IG: Mood4foodeatery",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"You definitely come here and pay for the experience. Everything else is just extra. Sojuba is a restaurant/bar whose insides are set up to look like a cracked out, high energy Korean club. The lights are dimmed inside the restaurant with strobe lights going off in the background. The seating is half patio furniture, the other half basic tables. Waiters bring you these plastic water recycled bottles filled with tap water for your table. There are giant TV screens playing a variety of music. When we first sat down on a Friday at 7 pm, we were welcomed with rap music. Later the music switched between Korean rap and KPOP. We ordered:1.) Spicy Chicken Wings- 3 stars (If you want to burn your insides that this is the dish to order. We could eat any of these wings at first because they were just too hot. After we requested honey mustard sauce from the waiter, we smothered our wings and could actually eat them.)2.) Chicken Bibimbap- 4 stars 3.) Scallion pancaked- 3 stars (I've had better. This pancake was barely crispy and disintegrated in your hand.)4.) Screw Bar Cocktail- 3 stars (I ordered this because I wanted to try this whole popsicle in drink concept but my drink was WAY too sugary) This establishment is definitely a place to go with friends for a cool fun experience. I wouldn't come back because the food was subpar and the drinks were sugar bombs. But I am glad I came at least once to take in the very cool atmosphere!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"Come here for the drinks and atmosphere, maybe skip the food but drinking appetizers are always welcomed. Flavored soju bottles and soju cocktails go for $10-13 each. Sojuba welcomes parties of friends just order drinks in an atmosphere that is dim, with Korean music and flashing lights - so similar to bars I have experienced in Korea.The food is overpriced with corn and cheese going for $12 and seafood scallion pancake for $18. The fried chicken has minimal flavor and is not nearly as good as Bonchon's or Crave's. The Boodae Jungol is pretty good but it's a pretty basic hot pot with a base and spam, ramen, veggies, etc. added.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"One of my favorite spots to go to. I made a reservation on a Wednesday night to throw a surprise dinner for one of my best friends. I brought a bunch of balloons and decorations but the table we were assigned to was in the middle of the floor -- our server was extremely kind and moved us to the lounge area by the bar so that I could put up the decorations. Not only did she make it more convenient, but the owner himself came over to help me set it. The customer service was above and beyond.On to the next important topic, food. It's amazing. We ordered chicken, boodae jungul, chicken gizzard, japchae, scallion pancakes, and kalbi. Everything was really delicious and came out quick.I highly recommend everyone to check this place out. It's a fun and chill spot to go to. Music is good and they have the perfect drinks to play drinking games!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"10/10 recommend. If you plan on going with a large group during the weekend, I'd suggest you to make a reservation. The restaurant gets filled with groups and may stay long to celebrate. They charge you a minimum holding fee, just be aware. Y'all must get the Melona Soju (with popsicle), wings (spicy and original), and bbq short ribs. Everything we ordered was good too but those were my favorites. The only thing I wished they had was a parking lot because parking in Fenway is kind of tough. Also, we thought we were designated to one server but they said to find any server to place an order. I'm assuming they work as a team! Bring your squad because the more the merrier.PS. If you buy a bottle or minimum of 10 soju bottles and beers, you'll get a light show. You'll feel like you're at a VIP table at a club. I was here for a birthday and they announced it over the microphone like a DJ at the club.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"Came here with my family on a Monday night at 6pm. Found a meter spot out front! There Were two other tables eating. Service Â was good!! Sojuba is set up in two sections; a lower seating area with Â dining tables, and a upper level with a full bar and a few tables. We sat in the lower area, we started with apps:Edamame - basic but you need something green French fries- amazingly crispy Large chicken wing combo ( garlic soy and spicy ) defiantly try!

So excited to come back on a weekend for drink and apps!!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"3,"I'll start off with the pros. It's a fun atmosphere with the lights, DJ, fun drinks and big TVs. The food is tasty especially when you're pregaming. Cons are the service is sometimes very spotty and the food is a little pricey for what it is.The food is not bad. Got the fried chicken (soy garlic, original and spicy) and both are good but soy garlic is my favorite here. The dumpling hot pot was good too, but for $30 it's a stretch for it being mostly ramen and veggies. It's fun to share but definitely not filling for more than 2 people. The watermelon soju is fun and it comes with cotton candy. The watermelon is a good size too but the actual drink was not strong at all. The yogurt soju was tasty but the melona soju was the best drink here. Half of the cup was straight soju so it's pretty strong and once the melona pop melts it's very tasty.I've been here once on a busy weekend night and once on a weekday during dinner time. Service was very spotty during the weekend. We could barely flag down our server and one of our dishes never came out. During the weekday dinner time, it wasn't busy and service was fine.This is a fun place with friends and I personally prefer here over MD.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"Staying at the airport Hilton and certainly did not want to eat here.

Get a grip people.",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"5,"Came here for dinner with my family and my former piano teacher by my sister's recommendation. She had seen it featured on Guy Fieri's show. He sure got it right this time! We started with the bruschetta and the calamari. The calamari was outstanding - not overly battered and I love when it comes with pepperoncini rings. They accommodated is and brought a side of tomato sauce for dipping. They could've been a bit crispier but overall delicious. The bruschetta was also well done - bread was sliced thick and nicely toasted and the tomato dressing on top was fresh. For dinner I ordered the lobster ravioli which was out of this world. They do not skimp on the lobster in this dish. The pasta itself was sturdy and tasty and the tomato cream sauce it was in was not too heavy and had great flavor. The portion was generous - definitely a standout. My father ordered the eggplant parm over the house made rigatoni and that was incredible. The eggplant was sliced thin, roasted to perfection and only light breaded. Moderate cheese topping - enough to provide the creaminess without overwhelming. And the house made rigatoni was remarkable. I kept picking noodles off his plate - I've never had better pasta. I also tried a bit of the gnocchi that my brother ordered on the side of his veal parm. It was good but the sauce it was served in didn't have enough flavor. It could've used a more robust marinara sauce in my opinion. My mom ordered the bolognese sauce which I haven't tried yet but I plan to tomorrow.We also shared a bottle of the Sangiovese blend. Once aerated a bit, the flavors opened nicely and it was a smooth, drinkable wine and paired nicely with our meal. Prices were more than reasonable considering the quality of food and size of the portions. Highly recommend this place, but the seating is limited! It's a very small place and they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. We were all impressed and it was a great reunion for my family and my teacher.

Â Everything is stated to be homemade and made-to-order.We came here for an early dinner, and we ordered: the Lobster Ravioli (literally, small fish-sized ravioli, jam-packed with ricotta, and tossed in a red cream sauce with tons of lobster meat; the sauce was just okay, and I didn't get what most people described as the taste being creamy and tangy; while the ravioli was massive, it seemed to be needed to be drained more, as it was a little watery inside; I did appreciate the abundance of the large chunks of lobster meat, which seems to match the price of the dish) and the Vongole (homemade linguini, garlic, extra virgini olive oil, clams, and finished with red or white sauce; we opted for the red; lots of clam, set on top of the dish, and they all were cleaned properly and tasted fresh; the linguini was cooked al dente, and the sauce tasted homemade.Just note that there is a note at the bottom of the menu where dishes cannot be split/shared, so each party will need to order their own dish. Â We got there early enough where there was no wait (very surprised, as I had heard that usually there is a long line!) and were seated right away. Â Service was friendly, but spotty - getting our orders in, drinks, the salad (which the lettuce was a bit limp), the bread basket, and the check took quite some time.I'm glad I was able to check out Rino's, but not sure if I'd return.+large portions+no splitting of orders+spotty service+plenty of parking in residential area",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"3,"We watched Guy Fiery feature this place, we waited more than an hour, we read all the reviews and chatted with other waiting patrons.

Â The chicken parm was the largest piece of crisp but tender breast I've ever had and the cheese perfectly melted. Â The lobster raviolis were enormous and there were 8 of them in a creme sauce with even more lobster tossed in. Â The octopus appetizer was also huge and well prepared!

You don't regret it!Do NOT get any of the other pastas, they are ordinary and whomever orders their non-homemade pastas will just end up eating the other people's pastas (which is what happened to my friend). You can have boxed penne anytime at home or anywhere else. Get their homemade pasta - whether it's gnocchi or ravioli or fusili or whatever......just get it. Everything is SO delicious. The sauces, the meats, the pasta. SO DAMN GOOD. The other thing to note are the portion sizes. Each bowl/plate of pasta feeds any army (ok more like 3 people, but still). There were 4 people in my party and we made the mistake of each ordering a dish. Wrong move. We should've ordered 2 pastas and maybe an appetizer. It wouldn't have been a problem if we lived there and take home leftovers (which, if that's what you're going to do then by all means) but we were catching a flight so we had to let a lot of food go to waste.

The lobster ravioli is really on another level",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"4,"Thanks to ""wonder-awful TV chef/bloated punk-pop hedgehog person Guy Fieri"" (to quote the Boston Globe), this is one of the hardest Boston-area restaurants to get into.bostonglobe.com/lifestylâ€_So you've seen Rino's on TV, have a 3 hour layover at Logan Airport, and want to check it out? Â Here are a few ways:1) If you have a party of 6 or more, you can make an actual reservation. Â But the catch is that you have to call at exactly the right time on exactly the right day when their reservation book opens up for the following month (I don't remember the day or time, so call the restaurant to make sure). Â Expect all the group reservations to be sold out within an hour, and possibly much quicker.I celebrated my birthday here a couple of years ago, and I made the reservation myself. Â As it turned out, rather inconveniently, I was sitting in an airport bar waiting for my flight to board when the phone line opened up. Â So a friend and I simultaneously speed dialed Rino's over and over and over, I'm guessing ~120 times over 10 minutes between the two of us, until we got lucky and grabbed one of the last remaining reservations. Â LOL, if you are motivated enough, it's really not that hard!2) Alternatively, you can wait in line outside the restaurant. Â Of course, you might be waiting 2-3 hours before they call to say your table is ready. Â As you can see from other Yelp reviews, sometimes you might not even get in!If you try this approach, take my advice and bring along a couple of bottles of wine. Â While Rino's won't let you drink them, if you get tired of waiting in line, you can head across the street to 300 Saratoga Cafe, which just happens to be Boston's only LEGAL byob restaurant (also Italian).yelp.com/biz/300-saratogâ€_3) Finally, try going for a late mid-week lunch. Â At 1:50PM on a very cold and blustery day in April (so perhaps everyone stayed home), we walked right in to a half-full restaurant.Personally, while Rino's serves well-made, fresh and tasty ""red sauce"" Italian-style cooking, there's no way I'm waiting 2+ hours in line for it.Street parking can be a challenge.

Â If you have never been here, I suggest to order drinks and an appetizer while you try to decide what you want. Â The reason for this you may ask??? EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS FABULOUS. Â The menu is quite large and they always have an additional page of specials. Choices, Choices, Choices. We ordered a round of beers and some Calamari to hold us over until we could decide. Â Finally we made our choices and awaited the Bounty.The first selection to arrive at the table was the Grilled octopus served over Cannellini bean salad. Â WOW!! Â THIS WAS THE BEST OCTOPUS I HAVE EVER EATEN. Â It was cooked to perfection. Â It was soft, not a bit chewy, it actually melted in your mouth. Â And the spices, AMAZING!! The Cannellini Beans were good, but the Octopus was definitely the star . $14.00The first entrÃ©e to be placed on the table was the Veal Parmiggiana. There were two large pieces of Veal pan fried and panko crusted topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese baked and served over HOMEMADE RIGATONI. This is a killer dish! The veal was tender and perfectly seasoned. The rigatoni were cooked al dente, OH Boy!! How Delicious. Â $20.00Then the Ribeye was brought over, My God! What a steak!! It was cooked perfectly and the spices Unbelievable! This Ribeye would challenge the best steak in Boston for only $30.00 and it's served with Asparagus and 3 potato Crochets. Who would guess the best steak in town is at an Italian joint not a steak house?? I'll definitely be going back again to fill my Ribeye void. I would have loved to see the desert menu, but needless to say, we were stuffed. However a double espresso was forced down.. It was a great blend. I give Rino's a Solid 5 Stars",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"5,"Yes, Rino's is tiny. No, they do not take reservations. Yes, the bathroom is located through the crazy kitchen. Yes, you will have to wait. Yes, the staff has some flare. Who. Gives. A. Sh*t. Rino's is the best old-school, red sauce, Italian-American restaurant I've ever been to. Never have I experienced a restaurant that was able to meet such exorbitant hype, until I dined at Rino's.The lobster ravioli here is no joke - hands down the best I've ever had. The sauce was clearly reinforced with either lobster or clam or some sort of seafood stock. The pasta was homemade. And the lobster was plentiful. My buddy shared a bite of his veal parm with me, which was also divine. It came on the bone still, which I've never seen before. They butterflied it and then pounded it out, so it was perfectly tender and not overcooked, so it was still juicy. The red sauce was also absolutely textbook.Check your high horse on the curb and venture to Eastie to experience Rino's. Or don't, so that way I can manage to get a table.",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"4,We were staying at the town place suites near airport and wanted someplace close for dinnerSaw it had great reviews and we are big Italian food fans. Loved it was in a neighborhood setting found a spot close on street. It's a small place so happy to get a table because it was full the time we left. Service was very good portion sizesAll the food was very good,Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"5,"I only wish I could have tried something else, because everyone else's dish looked too good. The lobster ravioli was exceptional. Only problem with it was there was too much, I wanted to eat it all. The sauce was very good too. They definitely didn't skip out on the lobster either. The side salad had two choices: a house vinaigrette or a creamy Italian. I made a good choice with the creamy Italian.",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"5,"This is exactly the kind of no-frills, homestyle Italian restaurant that I PINED for during my 6 years living in Texas. I came to Rino's with a group of friends and started out with a plate of calamari (absolute perfection) and a seafood special appetizer (a baby octopus dish that was super tasty.) I kept it simple for my entree and ordered linguini and clams in red sauce because I was so excited to just appreciate having actual homemade pasta for the first time in forever, and it did not disappoint. Scratch that- it was everything I hoped it would be and more. I absolutely cannot wait to keep coming back here and work my way through the menu!",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"5,"This is the epitome of a 5 star restaurant. Â I have to admit I was skeptical at first. The restaurant is in the basement level of a building and about a 5 minute walk away from the busy hub of North End restaurants on Hanover St. When I walked in, I felt like I was under the sea. The restaurant gave off a cool yet sophisticated vibe, with light that cast an ocean blue hue in some areas.Our server, Adam, was attentive, pleasant and calm. I couldn't have asked for better service. The food was excellent. One of the best we've ever had. 2 people in our party ordered the daily pasta with lobster, mushrooms and truffle butter. I had a little taste of this dish. Â If they have this on the menu, GET THIS. You can taste that the pasta is freshly made. The truffle butter, mushrooms and all of the flavors come together very nicely. You can taste the freshness of the the lobster tail. Â I ordered the spaghetti with clams with white wine garlic sauce. The clams and sauce had layers of flavor and the pasta tasted fresh.I considered knocking down a star though, because I can taste some sand/grit from the clams. For now, I'm leaving my rating at 5 stars because everything else was so good. Â  Â  Â  There is no kid's menu but they were able to accommodate with variations of adult dishes to make it kid friendly and size appropriate. We ordered a chicken cutlet and a pasta with bolognese sauce. The chicken cutlet was perfectly breaded and fried. Even though it was the thinnest chicken cutlet I've seen, it was not at all dried out. The portion size was very large and could easily feed an adult. My daughter who doesn't usually like meat, shared some of this and loved it. The spaghetti with bolognese sauce was very flavorful too. Â The sauce is thick and delicious. My daughter, who is very particular about pasta sauces and what's in it, raved about this dish. The portion size was generous for a kid's portion and was enough for me to have a taste. The bread, unfortunately was cold. It had good texture though and the delicious truffle butter makes up for any of its shortcomings.This place was all around excellent: service, ambience, food. It was pricey but reasonable for what you get.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Dinner with colleagues this evening, we were a little concerned about the basement setup as we walked in but it all got better when we were seated at a nice table with comfy seats and white table cloth. The young lady who served us was pleasant and smiling the entire time.The filet looked great, served with fries. I've never seen a steak plated like this - bone-in and served vertically. A good cut but not nearly enough meat on there for a full meal. Filet cut, so there's that.I chose the seafood stew and it was excellent. A large portion of salmon, shrimps, scallops, clams, mussels and underneath, a huge hunk of crab still in the shell. All of that served on top of a tomato risotto that somehow didn't splash everywhere. Very tasty and enjoyable, though ending with the crab and having to crack it after it was covered in tomato-ey juiciness was odd.A very nice meal and thoroughly enjoyed. Not quite perfect but very, very good.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"4,"I think this place was pretty good for their oysters. The service was pretty good, even though our server seemed a bit out of it. They definitely work as a team in their Restaurant. When our server was missing, the manager came by to ask us if we wanted another glass of wine. My husband ordered the bone in filet mignon , which was excellent. He normally doesn't like a lean steak, but that was his only choice at this place and he loved it. I liked their east-coast oysters and grilled octopus.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"3,"Il Molo could improve. Â Some things that I noted: Â Have two two small separate spoons for mignonette sauce and cocktail sauce of oysters. Â Having one led to a muddling of flavors. Â Also, Â the pasta for the special was undercooked, while the tomato sauce was so watery that I was left with dry chewy pasta. Â Not luscious or flavorful.. The seafood itself in the pasta dish was overcooked and under-seasoned. Maybe it is usually much better, but from what I tried, steer clear of the pasta.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"4,Good service by Adam.Spaghetti clams light and flavorful.Scallops risotto well seasoned.Fresh oyster and clams good.Mini lobster rolls didn't have the freshly shackled flavor or texture of bouncy crispness. Â Black truffle butter complimentary with bread a big plus!Clam chowder had too much potatoes.,il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Very happy with the food and service. We ordered scallops, oysters, lobster and pasta. Everything was fresh and delicious. The decor was perfect for our date night and the service was great. They also take reservations, which is a rarity in the North End, and less than a 5 min walk from Hanover. One star down because the dessert selection was minimal and uninteresting after a fabulous meal.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Let me start off by saying that I whimpered a little when I wasn't one of the Elites who got to partake in Il Molo's exclusive Yelp event last year. Â *Cue the violins* Â But as they say, good (or in this case, great!) things come to those who are patient. Â Fast forward to Sept 2017, I finally found myself dining here for a surprise engagement party and nothing was spared. Â Now, let's get on to the food!Per our usual, we engulfed our tables with an entire menu's worth of apps x 2. Â It's hard to choose only a few favorites but if you're stuck, you can't go wrong with the octopus, lobster crab cakes or the shellfish tower. Â The carnivores in our party also salivated over the steak tartare. Â The octopus had a nice mesquite flavoring but it was also the most softest piece of octopus I've ever had. Â This is coming from someone who had grilled octopus every other day when in Greece. Â The crab cakes were super fresh and had a very generous crab to breading ratio and finally, for the indecisive, the shellfish tower is a must. Â The raw bar was exquisite and the crudo of the day was exceptional which happened to be salmon that day; Great mix with a little bit of everything. Â The calamari and the mussels were solid choices but more traditionally prepared. For entrees, I had the pleasure of indulging in the swordfish, the daily pasta with lobster, mushrooms and truffle butter and the il Molo Polo. Â All tasted wonderful and were prepared perfectly. Â I highly recommend the swordfish for something lighter. It was so moist, not dry and stringy as it can sometimes be when it gets overcooked and the daily pasta with lobster over the Il Molo Polo for those that aren't afraid of a little carb coma after. Â Promise you it will be well worth it! Â All in all, it was a perfect evening. Â The food was superb and the service team was engaging, friendly and helpful. Â  As a seafood aficionado, I'll admit, I can sometimes be a pesky pescatarian but my experience at Il Molo that night brought a smile on my face that lasted for days and dayssss.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"5,"This is an abridged review as my daughter was struggling with jet lag so only had one course. The main, though, diver scallops was excellent. 5 or 6 very large scallops on a bed of risotto. The scallops were caramelized perfectly, and were quite large. The risotto had a nice, creamy consistency. For only one course, it was quite slow but the food still earned 5 stars.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"5,"We booked this restaurant for our friend's engagement dinner with close family and friends (about 24ppl, including young children). Â  The managers were prompt and responsive via email throughout the planning process. Â They didn't require a minimum or a preselect menu unlike many other restaurants. They gave us the private dining room and made the room work for our party. Â The staff was friendly and patient. Â We practically ordered most items off the menu. Â Items such as the following: raw bar, octopus, beef tartare, calamari, fried clams, crabcakes....and that was just the appetizer round. Â  Dinner entrees ranged from steak, scallops, seafood stew and shrimp pasta. Â All the dishes were generous portions and flavorful. Â  We ordered a custom cake (red velvet...though we got the coconut) via the restaurant. Â The managers spoke highly of their pastry chef and we confirm. The cake was super moist and flavorful. Â Only little disappointment was that they had one high chair in the whole restaurant (no booster seat either). Â We had a few young children with us. Â Overall, great seafood restaurant at a reasonable price.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Came here yesterday for lunch with my fellow foodie BFF BostonBestEats X.It was both of our first times here and it did not disappoint. Walking into the restaurant I was amazed by how Posh it looked. From the outside you wouldn't be able to tell how trendy and elegant it is inside. We took a seat at the bar and was greeted by the bartender (I think his name was Luke) We tried a few samples of the wine to see which one we would be pairing with our oysters. I went with the sparkling Rose (forgot the name) & my friend went with the Chenin Blanc. We ordered a dozen oysters (Half Indian Cave & Half Spearpoint) They were pretty decent sized oysters and tasted very fresh and delicious. We put in an order for the lobster roll to share & the pasta with bolognese sauce to share as well. The lobster roll came out split for us already (2 mini lobster rolls, it was so cute) It was so warm and tasty. The bolognese sauce for the pasta was very flavorful and the meat was tender. We ordered some cocktails off the menu to end our lunch. Mine was tequila based and it tasted every refreshing. I really enjoyed the meal and the experience. I would love to come back again for dinner since the lunch menu is limited to only a few dishes.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"1,I reserved a table and as soon as Â I arrived the manager told me to wait few minutes.

Gorgeous and beachy (think mermaid lounge) but not nautical. Fabulous!The food is great as well. I would highly recommend each dish I've tried, including the oysters, Charred Spanish Octopus, New England Cod Loin, Daily Pasta (Maine Lobster + mushrooms + Truffle Butter) and Pan Seared Diver Scallops.

We left Maine pretty early to board the train so I hadn't eaten prior to leaving. After our mile walk from the train station I was more than ready to try a delicious dish from what appeared to be a very cute and swanky establishment. We walked down the stairs and saw two gentlemen inside. We pulled on the door and it was locked. We stared at the two gentlemen inside and one looked down while the other looked at us and talked to the other man. The restaurant should've been opened at least an hour by this point. I knocked on the window; they stared at the floor.So why the 1 star? Because we stood there waiting for one of the individuals inside to acknowledge us and they didn't which is completely rude. If you were having issues you could've walked over and told us that. Inside you stood inside and did absolutely nothing while we remained on the outside confused and wondering why you were ignoring us. Shame on you.,il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Came here this past Sunday for dinner with my fiancÃ© on our last night in Boston. We had an early 5:15 reservation because I had to be at the airport.

Tried it for the first time tonight and everything was perfect, the bread and butter they bring out is delicious and our clams casino appetizer was out of this world. I ordered the Miso Glazed Salmon over the Brussels sprouts and it was truly amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly, the miso glaze was delicious and not too sweet and there was some homemade pesto on the dish that created a really good bite when you dragged the Brussels sprouts through it. My mom got the Frutti de Mare special with clams, mussels,shrimp, lobster and octopus over fusilli tossed in an arrabiata (spicy marinara) sauce and it was delicious as well!

My dinner companions both had the halibut with lobster risotto. Their plates were licked clean.The only minimal drawback was it being pricey.

Â He suggested some great local draft beers (there is an extensive menu of local craft beers) - cold, zippy, delish!!!We ordered the onion rings, Simple Chicken, the Hot and Cold Chicken Salad and the Tomato and Cucumber Salad. Â The chicken dish and the hot and cold chicken salad were PHENOMENAL!!! Â I didn't expect much and was deliciously surprised. Â The Simple Chicken was breaded and came with a delicate, flavorful gravy - like Marsala but better. Â The chicken had mashed potatoes, spinach and fresh tomatoes. Â A piece of chicken with the tomatoes and spinach and that flavorful gravy made for a crazy delicious bite. Â Total comfort food!!!!! Â I want that chicken in my dinner rotation.The hot and cold chicken salad was Asian inspired and had tons of asiany flavors. Â Sticky type rice on the bottom of the bowl topped with greens tossed in a soy dressing topped with perfectly grilled chicken breast slices - so satisfying. Â Onion rings were crisp and not oily and the Summer Tomato Cucumber Salad was bright and lemony. Â Overall a really great experience start to finish.

They just walked pass our tables without even looking at us. Tables around us had their orders taken, including tables that were seated 5-10 minutes after us. It's hard not to take treatment like that a little personally. It's a shame, because we like Parish and have had plenty of positive experiences there, but after this we aren't sure we want to go back.

Hopefully it was just an ""off day"".The good: The meatloaf main dish that we got was surprisingly tasty and was enough to split between the both of us, and the same can be said for the nicoise salad. Both were hearty and flavorful in their own way. The menu is quite large, especially the amount of sandwiches they had, which seems to be their expertise (we weren't in the mood). The not-so-good: Service was pretty unattentive, uninviting, and awkward. We had to flag them down for pretty much every portion of the meal experience.

My friend and I came on a Sunday right at noon and were one of the first few customers. Service is super fast and before we knew it, we had pipin' hot sandwiches in front of us. I got the Bravas sandwich because I'm a sucker for prosciutto and chorizo, but the overall sandwich was wayyyy too salty. The meat was more like overly preserved/salted salami and at one point, I actually had to pick out some of the meat so that I could actually eat the sandwich without tearing up from the intense sodium level. My friend ordered the Eggplant Milanesa; it was good, but nothing really amazing. It had a much more mushy texture overall and as much as I love avocados, they really didn't help with improving the texture of the sandwich. Overall - the portions are decent with a generous helping of potato salad / cole slaw. But the sandwiches were short of amazing and were just passable.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Very fun sandwich shop in Boston that collects (with permission!) the famous sandwiches of other local restaurants. I had the Bravas, a tapas-inspired chorizo sandwich. It was great - a little heat and a lot of flavor. The potato salad it came with was a little boring, but it did a nice job of cooling the heat from the sandwich. They managed to seat a large group at lunchtime with a fairly minimal wait, although service sometimes lagged (I had to ask multiple times to get my water glass refilled). That said, it's a very convenient location and it's a cool way to experience many different local specialties if you don't have long in Boston.

I got the Parish chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the hot and cold chicken salad. I really enjoyed mine and near the end, actually stopped eating because there was just too much chicken, it was so thick. I think I was supposed to have an option between potato salad and cole slaw but the waitress didn't asked me and instead I got both, albeit a smaller portion of each. I really liked the potato salad and thought the cole slaw was tasty too. The pickles were interesting. I'm not sure what I think of them.

In town for our son's graduation from Northeastern University. He took us here and we were not disappointed. I am currently in the midst of the Whole Life Challenge (performance level-no cheese no added sugars; watching for some preservatives, no breads or pastas , etc) so dining out is always a chore. I do not readily eat out while I dm on this challenge (saves health and my pocketbook!) but since we were traveling I knew I had no choice. I knew I was not going to be perfect (WLC is not about that anyway!) but I always try to study the menu trying to give it my best shot of eating highly fresh, low sugary foods without no bread/ pastas. I usually get a burger, hold the cheese, push the bun aside and substitute a salad or veggie instead of friesThis establishment had the most perfect delicious choice! (see photo/ i had to take a pic of the paper menu because I did not see it on their digital menu). In this salad I asked for the cheese to be left off and to add cold cut chicken. ""No problem"" our waitress said ( I am sure we were charged for adding the chicken but I did not see bill before my husband paid it) I love when staff can be so amenable to food substitutions. Easy peasy. Now, with a salad, most restaurants will add delicious, sugary, dressing, but not this one. The lemon ""vinaigrette"" was more like light olive oil and lemon Â --all fresh and light tasting. The peas, ginger, mint and mesclun mix had these small blasts of flavor. It was awesome. And the pieces of chicken were fresh, no added sugar sauce added. A moderate amount so this dish is not for big eaters. Perfect for me. I am a less is more gal. Â So if you are looking for a light, very healthy, non-dairy low-carb delicious dish--this is it! It is a great example how good a dish can be, prepared with balancing all ingredients well without resorting to sweet sauces.

After checking Yelp, we came across a few sandwich shops and The Parish Cafe struck our interest from the reviews. When we entered the cafe, they were pretty busy and the seating was limited. Therefore, we checked in with the hostess and were informed that the wait would be about 15-20 minutes. We decided to stay and wait since it was likely that other places were just as busy. They were consistently busy with people coming in behind us as we waited. This is something to keep in mind if you're looking for a grab-and-go place place to eat. Once we were seated, we waited a few minutes before the server took our drink order. They have a full bar, beers on draft and in bottle, and they have wine. Some of the options they had on draft were impressive. It was really hard to figure out what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu sounded delicious. You can see the chefs making the sandwiches in the kitchen which helped give us an idea of what looked good. I also checked photos on Yelp to see some of the favorites or commonly ordered sandwiches. Since we ultimately couldn't make up our minds, we each ordered different sandwiches (which would allow us to try more than one).After we ordered, the food was served shortly after. The sandwiches were DELICIOUS. I ordered the Bravas sandwich that came with a side of potato salad. Others in my party ordered the Le Mistral, The Bondir Brisket, and the Steak and Blue. My favorite of all was the Bondir Brisket. SO yummy. You can see their standard sandwiches on their website. They do have specials in house, too. (parishcafe.com/boylston/â€_ )I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food. It is a bit on the pricier end; however, that is typically expected for a fancier, specialty sandwich shop.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"Delish.Onion rings were perfect. Jumbo, tasty, and fried to perfection. This was just the start to a great meal. The outdoor patio was great on a July evening.Everything we tried was great.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"Arrived in Boston early one afternoon and wanted to eat somewhere casual near my hotel. The concierge suggested this place for a casual situation.One of my students and I arrived around 2 p.m. It was a Friday, so I thought it might have been a bit more crowded but we were able to get a table outside, which was nice. This was before Boston got too cold to function in. So, we ordered our first adult beverage of the day. A little pricey but what did I expect?We were STARVING since we just got off of a plane. So, we decided to start with the ""Hummus Platter."" We loved it. Mix of healthy and salty favorites. Enjoyed every second of it.Then, we ordered our meals. My student got the Nicoise Salad. She said it wasn't great. I ordered something completely on the opposite of the health spectrum. I went with the ""Hot and Dirty Pig Burger."" Very YUMMY and extremely SPICY--- exactly what this Texas girl was looking for. It was huge, though, so I ended up not eating the entire bun. Overall, I really liked it, though. Just think, bacon, peppers, red onion and more. Interesting that this restaurant takes meals created by chefs at other restaurants and adds them to the menu. I didn't get the story on this but would be interested to know why.Our server was perfectly nice, although I did have to ask for my water to be refilled. That is one of my flat-out restaurant pet peeves. Just after the checks came and we paid, the sky opened up and began raining. While everyone ran inside, we ran off to our next destination, happy and full!",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The servers were super friendly as well. I got the hot and cold chicken salad with arugula which was really good. I liked that they added rice into the dish Â which made it more filling. We also tried the mac and cheese (really flavorful) and The Bravas sandwich. Topped it off with the white chocolate bread pudding which was piping hot and scrumptious.,Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Came here on a busy Saturday brunch time. Got a corner window seat in 15 minutes (just a party of two) but the patio had an hour long wait! Our server was clearly flustered since it seems like they were a little short on staff.My companion and I ordered a half order of Bowl-O-Rings ($5.50) to start and it was absolutely amazing. Sweet onions encased by a crispy beer batter had us reeling for more! In fact that half portion was big enough to fill us up quite a bit before our entrees came. Honestly, all of the sandwiches sounded good on the menu. It was SO DIFFICULT trying to decide on one especially with all the good reviews! I figured since it's my first visit I'll go with their signature sandwich - the Parish Chicken Sandwich ($12.75) with baked buttermilk chicken cutlet, on a deluxe roll with romaine, tomato, cheddar, bacon, pickles, side of chipotle aioli. I took the potato salad option. I found the chicken cutlet to be a little on the bland side, and it was a little difficult to eat as a sandwich. The pickles added a nice tang. I wish the aioli was spread on the bun instead of on the side. The potato salad on the side however, was divine!Le Mistral ($20.50) is another popular choice here, and I can see why. The sandwich was huge, and had a lot of premium ingredients in it - garlic and rosemary marinated beef tenderloin, on ciabatta with caramelized onions, chive mashed potatoes, melted Bel Paese cheese, arugula, truffle aioli, crispy onions. My only qualm would be that the beef slices inside were a little tough and difficult to chew on. Flavor was great though!Will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"I really liked Mooo, the space itself is fairly large so they manage to fill a lot of space without it feeling cramped. The staff went above and beyond my expectations - seriously the best service at any restaurant I've received in a long time. I don't have any real complaints except the food was just good. For the price and all the talk about this place I was expecting the best steak I've ever had in my life...my steak was delicious, but not AMAZING and that's why I can't give Mooo 5 stars.I will definitely be coming back here because I did have a really great experience, but I'm still on the hunt for the best steak in Boston.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"3,"When we travel with our friends - we always have a bit of a competition on who can pick the best restaurant. Â We each get a pick for dinner and Mooo was my selection. Â Sadly I did not win this trip. Â I so wanted it to be better than it was but it lacked our expectation.Here was what was good: Â 1. Â Beef Wellington was full of flavor and the hit of the night2. Â Wagyu Dumplings were delicate and tasty3. Â Truffle fries were a hit4. Â Chocolate cake was rich and moist but could have used more vanilla ice cream.Here was what lacked:1. Â The $65 bone in ribeye was thin cut (despite 22oz) and was more like a Longhorn steak than a prime steakhouse.2. Â The filet, although cooked med rare, was dry and tasteless3. Â The escargot was unpalatable.4. Â The potato skins were a disaster of mashed potatoes on a skin5. Â Crime brÃ»lÃ©e was subparService was great and I wanted to love Mooo, but its all about value and they just did not provide that. Â The price did not match the product.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Moo is our go to place for special occasions! This steak house is divine! From the service to the food, to the atmosphere, it is all around greatness. The wait staff is so knowledgeable of everything from the drinks to the steak. The food is unreal. I only eat steak once or twice a year and this is the place I look forward to too indulge! The lobster Mac n cheese side is a MUST!",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"2,"We stayed at XV Beacon and this is their location for breakfast. Walking into the restaurant it smells of wet barn/mold that quickly made me lose my appetite. I had salmon with eggs --that was nothing to write home about. At least the English muffin was good with their excellent butter. I wanted to try dinner since everyone raves about the steak here. But after 2 breakfast attempts, I still couldn't get over the smell. The front of the restaurant near the street does not smell as bad. And the bar is excellent. We stopped in around 1030p for drinks not realizing they close at 10p. Â The bartender still accommodated us without any fuss.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Mooo is wonderful. Â The food is spectacular and the service is always great. Â I have never ordered a single appetizer, salad, soup, entree or dessert that I didn't love. Â It is a great place to go for any meal! Â The restaurant has a clean and upscale, yet relaxing atmosphere with trendy decorations and low lighting. Â I recommend the following dishes:1. The Lobster Mac n Cheese - Delicious and unique. Â The cheese sauce is rich and flavorful, almost like a bisque.2. The Tuna Soba Noodle Salad - Sushi-grade seared tuna over greens, chilled soba noodles, sesame seeds and an asian dressing. Â 3. Tuna Tartare- Served with crisp won tons in a soy ginger dressing4. Wagyu Dumplings- Out of this world! Â One of the best appetizers I've had in Boston5. Banana's Foster - Amazing dessert.

Lobster Bisque - A must in Boston",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"3,"This is a hard review to write. There was so much right about this place. And despite what happened I think I would go again. We had the carpaccio and wagyu beef dumplings as a starter and then had a rib eye each. With a cauliflower side. Had Australian Shiraz, the moolydooker which I already knew was superb. Steak was great carpaccio fantastic. Can complain. Issue comes with the dumplings... honestly the person who recommended me come here specifically said to get them. But, first bite. A little bit chewy I was thinking. Yup because there is plastic wrapping in the meat. Strange because that would indicate they aren't wagyu maybe, and obviously not good to have the plastic in there in the first place. This is where I get a little funny about it. I am not one to complain, so I called the waiter over and he had it replaced. They didn't charge me for the dumplings. But - I would just expect something complimentary. They charged for everything else. Then obviously I didn't tip hugely, because of that, then I got attitude. I was disappointed. I would go back and give it another go, it is highly rated but overall 3 stars is a fair assement given it would have been a 4.5 in normal circumstances. I left with a bad taste in my mouth.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Mooo is fantastic. Service was impeccable and they anticipated all of our needs. Easy to get to location, between the green and red lines. I especially like that the restaurant has a separate entrance from the hotel so that it doesn't feel like a ""hotel's restaurant."" You don't have to walk through a lobby, pass dozens of tourists, or take an elevator to a different floor with kids. We had the east coast oysters, lobster mac and cheese, escargot, and ribeye. Cocktails were well made. All of the food was exactly as we wanted it. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, and did a good job describing how the different steaks differ. The menu is large but not overwhelming. There is an excellent wine selection and you can host private parties in their wine cellar downstairs. We were there at 6pm on a Saturday and had a lot of privacy in our corner of the restaurant; it wasn't overwhelmingly busy. We'll be back to try more in the future. We'd come back for the bread alone.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"4,"This place is so close to get a 5 star but with the price tag, I expected a perfect experience with get 5 star. Parking wasn't an issue, even on Sunday dinner? There are plenty street parking close by. The place was dark, it was so hard to see the food. The table was so close to each other, you can hear the next table's conversation. We got a menu that says ""Happy Birthday"" on top, which was cute. The server is professional and knowledgable. You definitely needs his help finding the right steak because the menu isn't descriptive, Australian vs Omaha vs Steak frites, yet a huge difference in prices. Dinner was started with dinner rolls and butter. They kept the rolls warm by brushing with melt butter on top of a cast iron plate. It was buttery and delicious. Then we shared Lobster Bisque for appetizer. The split the soup for us and it come with beautiful presentation. The bisque was delicious and filled with pieces of lobster. We had lobster bisque at many places and this is the place that actually put many chunks of lobsters in the soup.We ordered the Australian Ribeye with Truffle Parmersan Fries for entree (entree doesn't come with side, only comes with bome marrow butter). Perfectly cooked, especially tasty when you get to put the bone marrow butter on top. The fries was a little small but crispy, and very delicious. We was full after the steak so we didn't get desserts but they give us complementary chocolate dipped marshmallow, which was very good.The staff was attentive and constantly filled our water, which is a good thing. Because what knocked one star out of the review was the salt. There Â was coarse salt on top of the rolls, salty lobster bisque, and salty steak. I love my salt , yet it was salty even for me, and my husband agreed. I would totally comes again due to the great service and food but probably asked for less salt next time.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,"I'd definitely go here again. Everything was SO good! Â Loved the drinks. Loved everything really. Â  Very dark, cool ambiance inside. Very cool decor. Â Loved the cow pics hanging up. Â The lobster mac was delicious. Â Pretty salty. My husband loved the marrow butter.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,My boyfriend and I came here for our 3 year anniversary and it exceeded my expectations. We ordered half dozen oysters and it was so fresh and the Lobster Mac is to DIE FOR. I had the filet mignon and it was like butter. For dessert we ordered the banana foster and they wrote happy anniversary on the plate. It was really cute and I really enjoyed eating here. For the price I would definitely say it is worth it.For parking expect to do valet because you would not be able to find street parking at all.,Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,"This review is special for a few reasons. This is my 400th review, I write to not only to inform but to also write about a piece of my life in writing. Located in Beacon Hill, you could throw a rock from the State House and hit Mooo. Driving and parking is a challenge but when you're in Boston, that is par for the course (especially in this neighborhood).We arrived approximately 10 minutes early for our reservation, and we were taken in right away to our table. We were able to check our coats with the hostess, no charge.The atmosphere is dim, intimate, and comfortable. We were seated near the entrance in a shared booth seat for two tables. A couple sat across from us. I loved the throw pillows with the cow-fur on them, it was a nice little touch.We started by ordering drinks. My wife had a couple of glasses of Inniskillin Vidal; it was a decadent ice wine that had a profound flavor of raisins to it, touch of vanilla, and notes of cherries to it. I wish I could have enjoyed a glass but this was pricey and I came for the food, not the wine. My wife, the opposite. I ordered CVNE ViÃ±a Real. It was a mellow crianza (my first), with flavors of cherries and cranberries. It wasn't particularly best paired for steak because it was a flat flavor and not particularly robust.So many things to choose from. I have had carpaccio and escargot. One thing I have not tried before was the bone marrow. Ordering this I knew I would be on my own. The plate is a beautiful presentation with the bone marrow served in the bones with pieces of toast. The bones are served on a mound of salt in a cast iron dish with a wooden cradle for carrying/moving. A side of gravy and roasted garlic in their bunch is served with the marrow. The marrow looks like grissel, but melts in your mouth and presents a rich, fatty flavor.Of course when I saw this placed on the table across from us with the couple who had arrived and not ordered yet, I was confused. Then, amused at the mistake as the server was explaining the dish and the couple were looking confused. Our server came over and apologized after removing the dish from their table. He was kind of sassy about the guy that delivered the food. ""He's only been here a year, he's still learning the tables I guess."" Drama in the kitchen, shots fired! My wife yelled at me for enjoying the petite drama. Overall, no biggie.After eating the bone marrow appetizer, I didn't have much room for anything else. So, the filet mignon at 8 ounces was a rational choice. Ordering medium rare, it was absolutely exquisite. The flavor of the meat was mellow, just the slightest seasoning. I didn't want sauce, I wanted to enjoy the filet mignon by itself. My wife enjoyed hers but she said she was bored with it and didn't finish it, we had gotten the same thing but hers cooked medium. Opted to get the truffle fries after reading rave reviews, I didn't find them terribly impressive and could have done without them. There was something off, I really wanted to like them. Everything else was a great experience.I had mentioned about including a piece of my life in these reviews. Regarding that, my wife and I came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We have been together for 13 years, married for 4 years. I consider this a gift from her because she isn't a foody like me. This restaurant is outside our normal price range but someplace I really wanted to try, and we came here as a celebration even though this isn't her cup of tea. This was a wonderful anniversary experience, and happy anniversary to my wonderful wife.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Located on the ground floor of the swanky XV Beacon Hotel, Mooo is a unique steakhouse. Unique in the decor especially; it doesn't look like your typical steakhouse at all. They've opted out of the dark wood notes and instead went for white and off-white tones complimented with some dim lighting. We arrived a few minutes early for our 8:30PM reservation only to find out that we had to wait a bit. No problem, their large bar was accommodating and made waiting for our table only a minor inconvenience. Except that we waited.. and waited.. and weren't seated until 9:10PM. No real apologies and nothing from the kitchen as a nice gesture, we were seated in a completely different area of the restaurant than what I had originally planned out. Famished, we decided to just move things along.We kicked things off with an order of roasted bone marrow ($19) which the kitchen split onto two separate plates - a very nice touch on their part and one that didn't go unnoticed. The panko breadcrumbs sprinkled on top made for a nice contrast and added a bit of crunch. It was a superb start to our meal.Next came our entres, which in our case featured an 8oz filet mignon ($44) for my wife and an 18oz ribeye ($56) for me. They absolutely nailed the temp on the meat and we also had the flight of sides ($21) with our food. The flight features whipped Yukon gold potato, creamed spinach, truffled parmesan fries and exotic mushrooms. We also added sauteed onions ($6) because why the hell not. The concept of having a flight of sides is really, really awesome and they were some of the best I've had in any steakhouse. The sauteed onions were okay but the real highlights were the whipped potatoes and the creamed spinach. I was very impressed and all-in-all, our meal was stellar. Even the complimentary bread rolls which came before our bone marrow appetizer was tasty.We did however hit another inconsistency with the service which took nearly 15 minutes to bring us the check, and another 10 to come back for my card. It was kind of a bummer since they're known for their service.All in all Mooo is definitely a premier contender for being one of the best steakhouses in town. The food is scrumptious and while expensive (even for a steakhouse), it does make for a nice, occasional treat. The decor is a bit whacky but if you're willing to overlook that, it'll make way for a memorable meal and experience. We'll definitely be back and hope for slightly better service next time. Until then, I'll dream of that ribeye...",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,"My friend and I went to Mooo Restaurant during a recent trip to Boston and we are so glad we did! Every moment of our dinner was exception! Their wine selection is very impressive. Their food was delicious and perfectly cooked. For dessert, I highly suggest the Banana Foster. It's the perfect way to end the meal.The atmosphere is great as well. It's quiet but still social. It's a bit dark so taking Instagram photos isn't a prime idea. But it's a wonderful choice for a celebration or fancy date night.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"4,"Decided to go to Mooo as a last meal in Boston before moving. We got the heirloom tomatoes and burrata salad and the wagyu dumplings to start. The salad was essentially burrata with tomato slices, which was delicious especially with the balsamic they throw on there. The dumplings, though there were only five, were quite good. The meat inside was very tasty, and the accompanying sauce was delicious.We both got two different ribeyes. The steaks themselves were prepared and served simply, with herb butter on the side, which along with some salt and pepper were than enough. The quality of the meat was good, but they both were on the leaner side, particularly for ribeyes. Overall, for the price, I would say it was worth it.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Oh, this is fancy. This is a high end steak place. When they have a menu that lists FIFTEEN different steaks including origin and description, it's going to be good. And great service from the hostess, bartender, waitress and busboys. Clean, well kept and neatly uniformed. Nice.My eye was drawn to the Uruguayan ribeye. I don't know that I've ever had Uruguayan beef before. And while it was interesting, I don't know that it was any better than any other high-end ribeye I've had. The marrow butter on the side was nice, as was the raw horseradish.For side dishes, we got the broccoli which was cooked right and mixed with some red pepper flakes and pine nuts. Tasty. And the potato skins which included gruyere cheese and bacon. Yum!Very good service, a great steak, a really nice restaurant. Five stars for Mooo.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"5,"Mooo - Boston , Massachusetts - 10/17/2017I'm a huge fan of Chef Jamie Mammano and the Columbus Hospitality Group having been to some of their sister restaurants; L'Andana Grille, Ostra, Mistral and recently Sorellina, Mooo has been on my radar for some time. Convenient in Boston parking via Valet or if you get here early enough, there's parking right next to the restaurant. Tonight I walk in and two of the staff recognize me from other restaurants. That's one of the things I love about being in the dining scene... At Ken's suggestion, course number one this evening... Japanese Wagyu Beef Dumplings in a Sweet Chili Soy Broth trimmed with delicately sliced Scallions... Between plating and taste, wow doesn't do it justice... It's the perfect execution of Art and Cuisine...Second course... Maine Lobstah Bisque... Brandy, Cognac served in a Butter Fleuron (essentially a really, really fancy soup bowl)... A mini Croissant floats atop a rich Broth with chunks of Lobster meat beneath... The Fleuron itself is wrapped in linen folded into a flower. Other than Table side pouring, this is one of the nicest presentations of Bisque I've ever been served...Course number three this evening...Tenderloin of Beef Wellington... Foie Gras, Spinach, Duxelle (Duxelles is a finely chopped mixture of mushrooms or mushroom stems, onions or shallots, and herbs such as thyme, parsley and black pepper, sautÃ©ed in butter and reduced to a paste~Wikipedia). I don't know if you've ever had Beef Wellington but it's an extremely difficult dish to get perfect. The Beef, a perfect warm Pink Center, sits inside a flaky Pastry Shell. When I tell you it was perfect, I mean perfect! Add to this a side of Truffles Cauliflower Gratin Parmesan Cream, Truffle Butter and Bread Crumbs... And some Roasted Fall Vegetables over Butternut Squash PurÃ©e... My palate is on sensory overload right now!And I've just been given the heads up to save room for dessert as the Chef has something special he's preparing for me...Course numbers four and five... On a rectangular plate comes out a trio surprise consisting of a CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e, mini Chocolate Cake wrapped in Chocolate Ganache and a Lemon Bomb (a frozen Lemon Mousse) Add to that an Apple Tarte with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream and my signature Cappuccino. I don't even know where to begin with describing how delicious it was... You need to experience this for yourself... I envision that this is what they serve when you get to heaven!

We ordered an espresso martini and Ugly Betty. The martini was great, but the Ugly Betty was something dreams are made of. Neither of us are big gin fans, but this drink is so tasty and well balanced, we simply could not have just one. We ordered a slew of apps in lieu of dinner. The oysters and wedge salad were fantastic, and it didn't go unnoticed that our lovely server split all the portions for us. She was wonderful and attentive. The calamari and tuna tartare were also delicious. The only item that we were not blown away by were the meatballs. They aren't bad, but definitely not show stoppers.

I called Mooo to ask about takeout but no one answered the phone; I walked over to inquire and they said no problem. The total price for the organic yogurt with fresh berries and house-made granola was $19.26 not including a tip. That may seem high but this was, without a doubt, the best yogurt and granola I have ever had. The granola had PISTACHIOS in it. So good. Also, the fruit was beyond fresh- the raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries were gigantic and juicy.Service was, naturally, perfect. Both of the employees who helped me were professional and friendly. Their takeout bags are cute and they give you shiny plastic silverware to make you feel fancy.""Would you like to charge this to your room, ma'am?"" I felt like I was in ""Pretty Woman.""

My friend and I stopped by around 3PM on a Saturday (for a linner? who even knows what meals are called at that point). We wanted to try the chicken and waffles but were told that they were only served starting at 4PM, so we took a bubble tea break across the street and promptly returned.We decided to try the shojo pig baos with the chicken and waffles, and they lived up to their name. Soft and with juicy, flavorful meat, they were the perfect accompaniment to our entree. The chicken and waffles had a very aesthetically pleasing arrangement. With a honeycomb-appearing waffle that was extremely fun to eat, the dish was an experience in its own right. The (boneless!) chicken was crunchy and very subtly seasoned. The honey butter was soft and light, blending very well with the syrup they gave us. And it was quite a bit of food! We left feeling very pleasantly stuffed, with the delicious honey butter aftertaste still on our breath.Service was great, and they seem to have quite a few accolades for their fries. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is because I feel like there's room for improvement with their flavors.

Took the T to Chinatown and found this place on Yelp for great drinks. Me and my hubby ordered a couple of rounds before going lunch somewhere else.

And Kung Fu movies behind the bar - score!",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"2,"The good: awesome menu, good drinks, and tasty food [once it arrives]The bad: very slow, inconsistent service; loud; and a debacle at the end where half of our late food was canceled out, leaving us hungry.This spot looked promising: Asian fusion small bites, creative cocktails, and awesome paintings all over the walls. It took a while to order, to get our drinks, and to get our food. For the items we got, most were worth the wait. I loved my Kamehameha cocktail ($11), which included chili-infused vodka, coconut milk, and citrus. It was inventive and refreshing. At the same time, it took about half an hour for my friend to get her glass of gin even after asking for it.There were some awesome food items, too. I was surprised to say I loved the mapo dofu fries the most; they're a fun rendition of the Sichuan classic. At the same time, the pork belly bao were not very flavorful. What really killed the night was that after waiting and waiting and starting to get worried about getting out in time, we asked for the check. At that point, the waiter assumed we wanted to cancel the items we had been waiting for for an hour. I could see why he might have been confused, but he should have asked. Furthermore, it means there was no idea how long it would have taken for us to get that food. Had it even been started yet?We called over the manager, who was apologetic and took 1/3 off our bill. This was a good gesture. At the same time, though, our table left still hungry and worried about being late to our show.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"We decided to enjoy a late lunch at Shojo in Chinatown.

With this air cast on my foot, high tops aren't very easy!We ordered a couple of cocktails and I fell in love with the Don Papa Daquiri. The drink was light, sweet and yet still refreshing. We decided to order a bunch of dishes to share. We ordered the duck fat french fries, kimchi fried rice, pig bao, sesame charred greens, bulgogi bao, and pork belly dumplings. The kimchi rice has a great texture and isn't overly tart or hot. The duck fat french fries are hot and crispy, the dumplings were nicely done but the sauce was a little too tangy for my taste. Both of the baos were soft with tender meat and fresh toppings. The star for me was the sesame charred greens. The greens still had texture but were tender and the sauce was a great blend of savory, sweet, and nutty.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Would love to come back and try more of the menu, everything looked delicious.We had the blistered shishito peppers which were good but lacked seasoning. 2/3 cocktails were a hit. One was a special and not to our liking.The food was very fast to arrive once we placed our orders, but service was not the best. Lots of time spent trying to get the attention of waitstaff.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"This place is very hip and busy. We tried their pork bun, calamari, duck fat fries, wu tang ribs, and cocktails. Everything tasted very good and fresh. This place is very loud so you want to avoid it if you need to have a deep conversation with someone though.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Been here a couple of times, and I keep coming back for their wu-tang tiger style ribs. Yup, they are that INCREDIBLE. Jam packed with a delicious peanut-y flavor, the meat is tender and falls right off the bone! Probably one of the best spare ribs I have ever had. That's why they are a must order whenever I'm here! I've also tried a majority of the things on their menu: the Shojonator, pork baos, kimchi fried rice, fish tacos, and the monkey chicken wings. They're all pretty good, though they don't have quite the same mind-blowing impact on me as (you guessed it) the tiger style ribs--they're the real star of the show! Keep in mind that the serving here is more tapas style, so I would say this your place to grab drinks and appetizers/light meal. This place has a hip vibe with cool wall art and poppin music, which is perfect for that chill night out. All in all, this place is solid. My friends particularly love this place so I know I'll be back!",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Back again since I'm back in Boston. The food never disappoints. The calamari and tiger ribs are my go-to dishes, and they were as good as ever. My wife enjoyed the basil ramen and the beef bulgogi, and she loved it. Service wasn't the best tonight. It's always a little slow at first, but this night was especially bad. Took forever to get served the first time, and the guy who finally did apparently wasn't our intended waiter. The bartender (who may also be the owner or manager) sensed our disappointment and put the first round of drinks on the house, which was very nice. Unfortunately, the service didn't improve the rest of the night. Food gets five stars, service gets a two or three. Attentive bartender/manager saves a star. Go for the fantastic food and drink. If your service suffers, can't say I didn't warn you. Hopefully it improves.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"3,"The waiter was really nice & helped us on ordering so got to give them props on that! I EMPHASIZE that this is definitely a more of a grab a ""snack"" & have a couple of drinks, but with me not being able to drink I stuck with the food. I got: Tori Miso Ramen, Shojonator & Grilled Kung Pao Chicken Sandwhich -ramen: most worth it for the portion/price but it was salty-shojonator: juicy/tasty, but not worth the price-Kung pao: tasty, but not worth the price I was caught off guard of the serving sizes and disappointed because I wasn't expecting it to be like snack sizes, so don't come if you're starving, but do come if you're looking for a light snack because the food is pretty good.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,Here for lunch on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Delicious! Pork in the ramen melted in my mouth. Kung Palo chicken sandwich to die for - if you like spice. Â Duck fat fries a true treat. Relaxed atmosphere. Loved it.,Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,The fries were really good! The shojonator was really good as well but it was a little small but would definitely recommend it.,Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"3,"Would rate this between 3 & 4 stars, but slightly closer to 3.Definitely loved the aesthetic and mood of this place. You'll notice the restaurant right away with the graffiti outside. Get there early as it gets packed! First time trying the food here, would recommend any of the specialities. A bit salty for my taste, but had some really interesting fusion flavors, very much a mix of modern and traditional. Drinks were a hit or miss, but consistently expensive. (Minus points for forgetting the flower on my drink.)At night they play Asian movies by the bar, was a nice addition. Ladies, there are hooks under the table at the bar for purses.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"3,"Came here twice and had good experiences overall but unsure about the food.The first time, we had a table for 6 and was waiting on 2 more for maybe about half an hour and our waiter didn't seem to mind waiting so that was definitely a good thing. Service was quick, staff was friendly and it was a good time. The table we sat at was not so good in terms of staying warm in the restaurant. There's a curtain where the main door is to prevent drafts but you can definitely feel it when the door opens and closes. It's very cold at times; especially when people keep the door open when waiting for a friend to exit. The bathroom is extremely warm, maybe because it's closer to the kitchen? When you exit the bathroom again, the restaurant temperature is really cold and you just sit there trying to not freeze for the rest of your meal. The second time, I came to celebrate a friend's 21st. We told the waiter, I think it was the same one as my first time here, and he brought over a shot in what we all thought was a teacup, which was quite odd. It apparently also turned out to be really strong and she couldn't even finish the rest of her regular drink. The regular drink, which we all got, was vodka coke. We thought it would be maybe $8 but it was $11, which was quite surprising. Speaking of expensive fare, the reason I gave it 3 stars is because the food is okay and tastes okay as well but probably not worth the money. The 2 baos are expensive and don't seem to have much inside. The shadowless duck fat fries are my favorite and I'd probably come back only for that dish. I've also tried the kimchi fried rice and think it's decent for $12 or however much it was but eh. Not the best I've had.Would probably only come back for those fries.Protip: there are hooks underneath the tables to hang your jackets on during the winter so no need to sit on them unless your butt's feeling a bit cold.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Best restaurant I went to in Boston and it's not even fucking close. S/o to Mike, Abby, and Doug for going way above and beyond to make a Cali boy feel hella welcome. Â I had the kimchi fried rice and it was bomb.com (not bomb.org). Â Idk what it was called, but Abby recommended some off-menu shit that was fire emoji af.These are my people; I'ma fight you if you give them less than 5 stars.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1,"Was in the mood for some Asian fusion so decided to come here. Â First it was super loud, I wasn't talking, I was yelling. Â 2nd, the food portions were pretty tiny and extremely salty. Â I got the shadowless fries which was waaaaay to salty and the Shojo burger or sandwich which was the same size as a slider. Â Lastly, at the end of my meal I saw an enormous, ginormous rat scurrying along the way and scaring the staff. Â Of course, it was so loud nobody noticed the few staff members screaming l, lol. Â HUGE RAT.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"This is such a fun place with really good food. It is small dishes, so it's great for sharing and enjoying all the incredible flavors. I also really liked the drinks. It does get really loud at times because it's a fairly small room and a lot of people go just to the bar, so that's something to keep in mind. My group basically ordered the entire menu, so here are my favorites:-Wu-Tang tiger style ribs: these are AMAZING. I'm not usually a person that orders ribs, but these come in a fantastic peanut-based sauce with lots of garlic and the meat is outrageously tender. You can just slide the bone out, it is that good. The portion is also huge. -Kimchi fried rice: the rice had great texture, and it wasn't too salty (I find some kimchi fried rices too salty). Also fried egg.-Shadowless fries: it comes with cheese and and mapo tofu like C'MON -Chicken and waffles: the chicken is super juicy and well-seasoned (tastes like Taiwanese fried chicken), and the waffle is great, but the five spice butter and syrup is absolute money.-Drinks are good too! Really like the Gin Gin Mule (I think that's what it's called?) and the Loneliest Monk.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"3,"I've been spoiled by amazing Asian and Asian fusion restaurants in LA and NYC, and Shojo honestly just misses the mark. My friend and I ordered a good amount of variety, but everything was just pretty average. I was expecting some hardcore yumminess based off of the Yelp Reviews, but we were disappointed by dish after dish of mediocrity. The chicken and waffles were decent. The chicken was fine. It was juicy but wasn't seasoned very well. And the HK waffles it sat on were so incredibly soggy and bland. I've had great HK waffles from LA, NYC, and even Hong Kong, so these waffles honestly felt like a very sad homage. There are sooo many things that the waffles could have done better: texture, flavor, sweetness, even presentation. Needless to say, def pass on the dish! Shojo Pig Bao was pretty standard. Nothing amazing but at least it wasn't bad. Pork Belly Dumplings were also just okay. The skin was thick and too chewy. And you would think with pork belly that it would be rich and juicy inside. But it actually almost tasted dry and had kind of a coarse, rough texture. The restaurant did not live up to the Yelp Reviews. The ambiance is def very cool and young - great for grabbing a drink in a chic modern place, but not ideal for catching up with friends/intimate conversation (because the music is super LOUD)! Drop by for the drinks, NOT the food.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"This was what we chose for our last dinner in Boston, and we're both very glad we did. The location was very close to the Hyatt and could walk over. The inside was fairly dark and the music louder than your average sit-down but it matched with the clientle and vibe of the place. We ordered a plate of charred greens, the tiger style ribs, kimchi fried rice (huge bowl), and their pork bao. Was all delicious but we especially loved the ribs and the greens. The pork bao had a great bun but the meat inside was still a bit tough. Great experience overall and would definitely go back again when in Boston.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1,"Hm... not sure what the four star review is for.The deco inside and out was great, and they had great music playing... but the food was just awful. We had two dishes and they were equally bad.$9 bao; trying really hard to be Momofuku's pork buns but failing. The meat was great but the sauce was too strong. The bun was too dense. The sprinkle of veggies they put on were old veggies - i could tell by the way it had wilted and clumped.... $12 kimchi fried rice; too much rice that wasn't cooked well. There were too many clumps of rice. The sunny side egg was too well done to be put on kimchi fried rice - should've just made kimchi fried rice with scrambled egg or something. It also wasn't ...seasoned/flavored well? They either skimped on kimchi or gochujjang. It was rather bland. All in all, i can tell they are trying new things... but for the price, it was super underwhelming and food could be way way better.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"My wife & I were here on a Sunday evening 2 weeks ago, I wish I could rewind and start our meals again!! The Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip with Shallot Butter was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked to the correct temp, worth every cent! Also had a side of Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese..Awesome!! My wife had the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails and side of Grilled Asparagus with Lemon. Plus great service from our waiter. Fantastic dinner experience from start to end!!",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"2,"I had the aged porcini rubbed bone-in steak and was unimpressed. For $52, I didn't expect so many pieces of fat chunks and couldn't taste any hints of the porcini rub. My dining companions had a boneless steak entree and the swordfish, which they seemed to enjoy. We dined in around 5:30pm on a Sunday and service was non-existent. We didn't see the server at all after our entrees were served. He didn't bother to ask how the dishes were when he came back to clear the dishes. Our water glasses remained empty during dessert.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"4,"Parking-garages near byAmbience-high end, special date nightFood-had just shrimp cocktail and Caesar salad, also there bread tray,all very Â good.Service-ate at bar, service excellent Prices-for bar menu reasonable price, dinner more expensive, main dinning room beautiful, bar area beautiful Cleanliness-cleanWow-great place!!

Â They didn't disappoint. We started with a variety of appetizers including the lobster mac & cheese. It was absolutely my culinary highlight in Boston, cooked to perfection. Â The service as expected was top notch. Â They are obviously known though for their steaks, and thats where i put the weight in the review: I had the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip, and wow what a steak.

It was also a friend's birthday and they brought out a complimentary dessert so we could celebrate..they even put confetti on our table!We all tried different things from the menu and thought they were all solid, so you can't go wrong with any of their meats.Personally, I got the porcini rubbed sliced tenderloin cooked medium and I thought it was AMAZING. There was a slight spiciness to the dish from the rub, which really made the dish. Â I'll definitely be back in the future!",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,Came here on a Thursday night it was my wife's birthday. I called made reservations for 7:15 asked for a booth they couldn't guarantee but would do their best to accommodate us. We arrived a few minutes early gave my name there were 2 hostesses both of whom wished my wife a happy birthday and said our booth would be ready in a minute. We were seated in a beautiful booth and there was a card on the table signed by all the wait staff it was kind of cool they had some glitter hearts n stuff pretty nice gesture. Our waiter was Khalid Banassou he was awesome he was friendly had our drinks filled took our order had our appetizers out and our entrees at perfect intervals and once I mentioned how much I loved the bread there he kept me loaded up on bread and butter throughout the entire meal. For appetizers my wife got the Shrimp cocktail I got the cast iron garlic shrimp. She loved hers mine was good it could've been juicier and had more garlic but still ok. For entree she had seared dry aged sirloin and I had the bone in rib eye no complaints on either steak I've never had a bad steak from any Capital Grille location I absolutely love their steak and my wife is not a big steak eater and she loved hers. For a side we had the au gratin potatoes and those too were great. The atmosphere at this location is great we had a perfect booth a great server the meal was fantastic then Khalid came out with 2 mini pieces of cheesecake with candles in them singing happy birthday. The mini cheesecake was delicious we ordered a coffee for her double espresso for me and the mini cheesecake saved me about 1800 calories. 1 question why Capital Grille Why ? Get the calorie count off the menu I know I'm a glutton I don't need a reminder thank God the complimentary bread and butter wasn't listed in the calorie count or we're talking calories in the stratosphere !!! Oh almost forgot as if everything wasn't great enough we were talking with Khalid and I mentioned that when my wife makes my steaks on the grill she rubs them kind of the same way as they do at Capital Grille and he says hold on goes in back comes out with a container of steak rub ! What a great evening great service great food great atmosphere just a great time,The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Came here for restaurant week and boy am I glad I did!!! The ambience and mood of the interior is really nice. The service is also wonderful, waiters have a good sense of humor and personality. I had the chef special lobster bisque (additional $5 charge), the bone-in kona (additional $10 charge), mashed potatoes and string beans (accompaniments) and the dark chocolate espresso cake. The lobster bisque was out of this world. Imagine a clam chowder but better and with lobster. The bone-in kona was cooked to perfection, it just melts in your melt. The mashed potatoes was the best mashed potatoes I've ever had in my life. The dessert was awesome and the creme brÃ»lÃ©e that my friend ordered was some of the best I've ever had!",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Came here for our wedding anniversary. Called ahead and made a reservation. The staff had the table set up for our anniversary. Kathryn was very professional and attentive. My wife had the French onion soup, NY strip steak, and a bohemian. I Ahmad the swordfish with lump crab gratin and a grapefruit, fire & ice. We shared some mashed potatoes. Food and drinks were great. A bit pricey but, very good. We were also given a free dessert for our anniversary. This was our first time here and will definitely have to try it again.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Each visit to America, I'd wanted to try The Capital Grille. Â Finally I got a chance to do so in Boston recently and I was really blown away ... especially because it's a chain restaurant, and I didn't think such upmarket chain restaurants existed like this.From the minute we walked in, we thought we were in some glamorous movie or something. Â The decor is outstanding and old worldly. Â It's a little dark inside, but still beautiful and unlike any other restaurant I'd been to. Â When the waiter went to place our napkins on our laps, he even asked if we were ok with a white napkin, or would we prefer a black one. Â I NEVER heard of this before, but I was awestruck and knew we were in for a great experience here.The service was impeccable and the menu reasonably extensive. Â They were also quite obliging in making substitutions if need be. Â For my starter, I had the tuna tartare with avocado, mango and sriracha. Â You'd think I'd never seen food before. Â I practically inhaled it as it was so delicious, though I didn't want to dig in to the pretty presentation. Â For my main, I had the salmon (surprise, surprise) which was seared in citrus with brown butter. Â I had au gratin potatoes with it and I could have licked the plate clean if it wasn't such a classy joint. Â I swear it was one of the most delectable meals I've ever had, and was mad at myself for not trying it sooner. Â I had no room for dessert (another surprise), so have no idea what they're like, but I imagine them to be just as delicious.Having said all of the above, I DO think it's a tad on the pricey side ... especially seeing as you do need to get side dishes with your mains. Â It's the kind of restaurant that you'd go to for a celebration or a romantic date; not the kind you'd pop into for a casual Sunday night dinner. Â But don't be put off by the fact they're a chain restaurant. Â They are very, very upmarket and cannot wait until I can go to another Capital Grille again.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,Absolutely amazing experience from beginning to end. My wife and I came here for dinner on our first wedding anniversary. Â The table was decorated with rose petals and staff signed a card congratulating us on our anniversary. Our waiter Dominique was amazing. Â Very polite and knowledgeable on the menu. Porcini balsamic ribeye was the best steak I've ever had. My wife's filet could be cut with a fork. Thinking about cancelling our reservations tonight and coming back to capital grille.,The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Once again this is my favorite place to get a proper steak. Absolutely does not disappoint. I usually get the Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak which is 24 oz. of absolutely impeccable meat. Truly the best steak I have ever had. For the side I get the Garlic Fries which are great. Sometimes I get Sam's mash potatoes which are also really good. For dessert I get the CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and it is to die for. This place is great for any occasion, no dress code. But usually casual/business is preferred so you don't look out of place.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"4,"I came here to try out the Boston dine out course meal (appetizer, main, and dessert). We were in this area already and thought about going here so we called the restaurant around 7pm. The earliest time that we can get the table was 10pm. So we though we can just walk there and seat at the bar. While we were walking toward the restaurant, I thought about checking he OpenTable app. Thankfully there were openings at 7:15pm and 7:30pm which is likely that some people cancelled at the last minute. I selected the 7:30pm reservation and got a table right away. It was extremely packed! I don't think it is a good idea to come here during the restaurant week without an reservation. The bar area was completely full. Also there were so many people standing and waiting for their table. I believe here has the best (at least one of the best) deal for the restaurant week in Boston. We got wedge and caesar salad which were quite a huge portion and excellent taste. The wedge salad was definitely fresh and crunch. The blue cheese dressing was not too strong and i really enjoyed the grape tomatoes that harmonized with the wedge and the dressing. I got the NY strip (medium rare) which was also a huge portion. The texture was so soft and the taste was juicy. I also tasted the filet mignon (medium rare) which was even softer than my NY strip. I think I will get the filet mignon next time. I asked for pepper sauce which got along with the steak. It was just unbelievable how nice the meal was.The highlight of the meal was the desserts. The classic creme brÃ»lÃ©e was beyond being heavenly and the flourless espresso chocolate cake was literally melting in my mouth. The portion of the food was very generous and the taste was excellent that the cost of $38 felt so affordable for what we got. Thanks to the Boston dine out week, I had a wonderful meal tonight.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"If you're wanting to celebrate an occasion in a special way then the Capital Grille can make that happen. We had such a pleasant experience here. Our waiter was incredible, food was delicious, and other staff even made us feel like royalty.I made reservations a couple of weeks in advance for our anniversary. They sat us in a smaller room that was much quieter. They had heart confetti and a signed card on the table for us. Food:Lobster bisque was delightful. Perfect lobster flavor and the broth ever so silky.I ordered the Gorgonzola and black truffle bone-in NY strip. it was perfectly cooked and the toppings and sauce were tangy enough to cut through the meatiness. I also ordered the lobster mac n cheese. It was SUPER cheesy, only found two pieces of lobster in it but overall it was good.My husband ordered the dry aged Porterhouse and enjoyed it. He also ordered a Fresh Maine Lobster which he LOVED. I was able to snag one bite and gave it a thumbs up. Finally they spoiled us with a sweet Happy Anniversary dinner plate. It was an incredibly romantic experience and we had a memorable time.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"The Capital Grille is top notch. I've only had the pleasure of eating here a few times in my life because it is $$$ but each time is a pleasure. I always get filet mignon at steak houses because I like the less fatty, more tender cut of meat. The filet here is to die for: perfectly seasoned, juicy, and tender. However during my latest trip here (restaurant week 2017), I opted for the bone-in NY Strip just to mix it up. The meat was a bit tougher but still had amazing flavor. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here so don't fret too much about what to get. I think the Capital Grille is the best steak house because they consistently have impeccable food AND service. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion, The Capital Grille is the place to be.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"One of my favorite restaurant in town for steak!!!

It was perfect timing, because I always wanted to eat here after hearing great things from my friends. We were there for dinner, and the Restaurant Week option was the three-course menu which included an appetizer, an entrÃ©e, and a dessert for $38 per person. Great deal!We ordered: New England Clam Chowder and Wedge with Blue Cheese and Nueske's Bacon for Appetizers, the 8 oz Filet Mignon and the 14 oz Bone-In Dry Aged NY Strip for EntrÃ©es, and two crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©es for dessert. The dinner also comes with mashed potatoes and french beans and tomatoes! This was plenty of food and I'm not complaining!Our server was very hospitable. Since it was our one year anniversary, they put us in a more private room, and sprinkled rose petals on the table, and included a ""Happy Anniversary"" card that was signed by all the staff. It was so thoughtful of Capital Grille and they exceeded my expectations! They even offered some delicious desserts on the house for us in the end. By far my best experience.

We will be back.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"4,The interior West fancy-looking with Frank Sinatra playing in the background. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. Prices here was on the high end and portions were okay. I ordered the New York aged steak strip with Gorgonzola and truffle. It was cooked medium rare and juicy. The red wine sauce that they had with it just complimented the steak. Sides weren't included. Overall they were very accommodating because we had a cake also that they cut for us. This place is good to try once in awhile and I would recommend anyone to come try it for their birthday.,The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Hi I'm MinhThis place is bonkers.The ambiance is dark, cool and perfect for a cool date night. The decor is very upscale and made for a very intimate and relaxed atmosphere.I made a reservation for restaurant week and I am glad I did since it start to fill up as soon as my friend and I arrived. We were greeted politely and brought to a table a bit outside of the main dining area, which worked out very well. Our Waitress Melissa was FANTASTIC. She was very friendly, told a lot of amusing dad jokes and knew the menu in and out. You could tell that she really LOVES steak. She broke down the menu and made sure we had enough bread and sides to go along with our meats. Â My friend and I both got the clam chowder, bone in NY-strip and the creme brulee.The chowder and brulee were very tasty and definitely was not the luke warm type of meal I was expected out of restaurant week due to the high volume of people. Oh man did that steak taste fantastic though. The steak was tender, juicy, and had that very slight waft of dry age that came out. The quality and how it was cooked was nearly perfect and I would definitely recommend that to anyone trying it out.All in all, a fantastic dining experience thanks in part to Melissa and definitely ask the waiters what their recommendations are, that's why they're there!Hope to see you guys soon here!",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"5,"This place is such a hidden gem!

I've been for brunch and dinner, and it's definitely more crowded for brunch. I don't know why they haven't gotten people to come for dinner, but it's pretty empty in the evenings.So many unique options, and their drinks are really delicious/cute for photos.

It was Father's Day so the place was jammed pack and lots of people were waiting outside. We placed our names down on the waiting list and waited outside. Fortunately, the wait wasn't too long and we were seated within 20 minutes. We ordered and split the Morning Madness and the Nutella Strawberry Toast. They were kind to let us substitute the french toast in the Morning Madness with the Baileys French toast for a small charge. Food was good and portions were large; we were definitely both super full when we left. The Nutella Strawberry French toast tasted delicious, but not too overwhelmingly sweet. I've had better brunch elsewhere for the same price point, but I would recommend Milkweed for those who live in Mission Hill and crave some nice brunch.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"A wonderfully healthy lunch with my best friend! I love eating healthy food; fortunately, I found this amazing clean and healthy restaurant near my Roxbury Community College. Â I will keep patronizing this place.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"I stayed by the Roxbury Community College for a week and I was so happy that Yelp helped me locate Milkweed! It was only a 10 minute walk away I really expected to wait for a table because the reviews were so great. I was pleasantly surprised to walk right in and be seated at 8:15 in the morning on a Saturday (I've seen lines around the block at 7am for popular breakfast spots in SF & San Diego). Everyone was so nice and there were so many tempting choices! So hard to decide! My hubby chose the special of the day (cheesy grits, pork belly and challah toast) and I chose the Shakshuka Â (stewed tomatoes, peppers, onions, spicy, feta cheese, over easy eggs and challah toast). Everything was so yummy! (@.@) The servings are large (my hubby and I shared my left overs for breakfast the next morning). I also enjoyed a pom/sparkling wine with my meal. The muffin of the day was a coconut/chocolate chip. I took one to go and only regretted that I didn't buy two. The muffin was perfect! Not greasy, was spongy & not too sweet. Â Our server was Bridget and she was great!Kudos to Milkweek from your staff to your inviting atmosphere to your creative but approachable menu to your quality ingredients........everything was spot on!",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"One of my favorite brunch place, but show up early because this place gets packed and there usually is a bit of a wait during the typical brunch hours!Service (5/5): The servers were very friendly and took time to check-in and give recommendations despite the busy buzz going around at the place. They were all full of smiles, which always makes me smile :)Space/Setting (4.5/5): Seating is a little tight, likely due to the popularity of this place, but the decor is cute and the lighting is great, especially at the bar seats by the window!Food (5/5): I got the powerbowl + salmon and W O W was I a happy camper after that meal. The powerbowl is very filling and the salmon was good (a little dry, but still hit the spot). It's a great thing to order if you want to feel a little healthy and enjoy all the colors from the sweet potatos, beets, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, etc. I would definitely come here again to try some of the other infamous brunch items! Such as the lucky charm pancakes, strawberry + nutella french toast, and the breakfast sandwich!!",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"4,"Food: 5/5 We had the Nutella and strawberry French toast, corned beef hash, and the scramble. The French toast was a perfect portion, very light, fluffy, and drizzled with Nutella, fresh strawberries and a generous scoop of butter. Â The corned beef hash was tasty and also a pretty large portion for a side. The scramble was okay. Their menu offers a lot of variety and there's a decent offering of beers and cocktails.Ambience: 4/5 Decent brunch atmosphere. A little loud Service: 3/5 Â The wait for a walk-in on a Sunday morning for 2 was pretty manageable (45 min). We waited about 15 mins for our food so it felt a little long for brunch but otherwise the service was okay. Felt slightly understaffed Value: 5/5 Great food for the price! Would come back",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"4,"On a recent visit to Milkweed I tried the Shakshuka. The dish was flavorful and huge. Large meatballs, spicy pickled peppers, feta cheese, and yolky eggs were soaked in a chunky tomato sauce. Two large pieces of toasted challah bread soaked up the sauce nicely. Overall, Milkweed is a good choice for breakfast.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"Fab-u-lous brunchin' spot. This also means there will be quite a wait during peak hours...plan accordingly.Power Bowl ($13): Quinoa, beets, squash, avocado, mixed with a light dressing. I wish I could have one of these every morning. It is a pretty big portion, so don't be scared to eat half and save the rest for later! However what's good about this is that it fills you up quickly but goes down relatively easy, so you'll be ready to eat again in a few hours and won't feel awful.Fresh berry Pancakes ($8): These pancakes are dangerous. They have the perfect degree of sweetness that makes you feel like you are eating a poundcake rather than pancakes...needless to say, they can become hard to stop eating. Especially when you cut yourself a piece and it happens to have a ton of blue berries baked into it...why do you do this to me Daily Catch?!Gyro ($9): Another great option for a healthy breakfast, and you get a lot for what you pay for!The overall consensus was that we got a solid meal for what we paid for, had perfect service, and were extremely happy with our food. Come to LA, Milkweed!",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"3,"Boston must seriously be lacking in quality brunch spots if the wait for Milkweed can balloon up to 1.5 hours for a party of two during peak meal time (12pm) on a Saturday. I've never waited so long for brunch, and very few things are worth such a wait in the cold- Milkweed included. My best friend and I came out of our way to try out Milkweed after seeing all the fanfare on Yelp. We did not expect the large crowd outside the restaurant, but opted to commit to eating there anyway after being told of the hour-long wait. We did however grab donuts at the nearby Mike's Donuts to tide us over. After countless parties ahead of us, we were finally seated at the counter by the window. Be forewarned about the lack of hooks under the counter for bags and jackets, which is super inconvenient for the winter months.For brunch, we chose the steak and cheese scramble and the Morning Madness plate. I found my scramble to be a bit salty and my friend's eggs were a tad undercooked. Otherwise, still good and delicious. While the portions are sizable here, Milkweed also offers few things on the menu that you can't get elsewhere. Service here is also lackadaisical, as the host does not check in on waiting parties outside. We didn't get a refill on our water and had to flag down the waitress for the check when she didn't check in with us at all during the meal. Honestly couldn't get out of there fast enough. Overall, Milkweed does serve a solid brunch menu in a cute restaurant, but service was frankly subpar and I am wholly underwhelmed by my experience here.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"I simply cannot say enough about Milkweed. Pound for pound one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. Enjoyed brunch there with my boyfriend while visiting Boston. Menu was conscious, creative and clever. Holly, the owner, waited on us, and I completely submitted to her recommended dish (who wouldn't!), which was the veggie breakfast gyro. 2 eggs over brilliantly seasoned grilled veggies (including olives, which were maybe the best part), covered with 2 over-easy eggs. Oh. My. Gosh. The tastes were really different and divine.Coffee was great.The place feels like a perfect blend of home, sweet design, and just that little bit of brave urban pioneering that makes you want to say a big YES to Milkweed. We sat next to a gal who was taking lunch from her nearby government job, which we loved. It's not just for yelpy travelers, this place serves those (yes, I was that), and ALSO people who work in the schools and hospitals nearby. It feels authentic. Â It IS authentic. Honestly, what are you waiting for. If you're within 50 miles of Milkweed, go, now. The dinner menu looked just as incredible as breakfast, and if we'd not discovered Milkweed during our last day in town, we would have gone back (we almost did in any event).",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"LOVE. MUFFINS.I could end the 5-star review there. You have to go and order the love muffins to understand. I am devastated, yes, DEVASTATED, that Milkweed didn't exist when I lived on the Hill. Thankfully, now that I am back at Northeastern for law school, plenty of my friends live in the area and I can make excuses for stumbling into Milkweed.I should give credit to the Shakshuka as well, it was HUGE and perfectly seasoned. Definitely a portion to share. If you are lucky enough to get a table (there is usually quite a line because of the LOVE MUFFINS), you will definitely not be disappointed.I hope Milkweed is here to stay.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"I've been a Roxbury/Mission Hill resident for three decades now (yes, I'm old...), which means I'm forced to embrace the influx of newcomer small businesses, but Milkweed makes it easy :) My husband and I have dined in several times now, and yes, the hype is real!// BRUNCH //To avoid the weekend wait, I roll out of bed half-awake (if you see me, look the other way) just to get my butt here before 9AM. The vibe starts off cozy and serene then transitions to the brunch rush of local college students. Everything is delicious and always consistent. My only wishes: crispier home fries (personal preference) and more tea/latte options.My fave brunch items (these sell out quick):1. Lucky Charms pancakes - genius to incorporate millennials' fave childhood cereal.2. Shakshuka - I love that the tomato sauce is medium spicy and that it comes with meatballs and (practically a whole loaf of) challah bread. Portion is huge, to say the least.3. ""Love muffin"" of the day - home-made, griddled, and buttered.4. Egg sandwiches - well-made, simple, and non-greasy.// DINNER //Dinner scene is more tranquil and intimate with mood/candle lighting. They serve higher-end pub fare. Generous portions again - hey, I'm all about sharing is caring. Recommend ordering: skillet fries, buffalo wings, steak frites, buttermilk fried chicken with KALE mashed potatoes (kale never tasted so good), and a side of the coconut black rice.Service is always pleasant and usually attentive. Shout-out to the sweet owner/manager/muffin queen, Holly, who runs the show. Encore, please!!",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"I'm just a basic girl that has brunch needs... and Milkweed definitely satisfies it. I came on a Monday afternoon and there was no wait (thankfully). We were seated immediately and the servers were super friendly. LOVE MUFFINBanana and chocolate. In a muffin. And it's name has the word ""love"" in it. How much cuter can this get? We ordered the last one and they toast it to chocolate melty perfection. But honestly, banana chocolate muffin can be done easily at home. This place just makes it perfect and the name is just irresistible.FRESH BERRY PANCAKESI love carbs and I love sour things (like berries!) so this order did not disappoint at all. The pancakes are fluffy and soft and there's a lot - so you can share!POWER BOWLThis was totally up my alley. I basically eat power bowls for lunch everyday at work so when I saw this, I wondered how they could make it different. Honestly, the mixed greens with the roasted veggies and avocado and quinoa and everything is just a combination that can't go wrong. BACON AND AVOCADO SCRAMBLEIf you're looking for your usual brunch food that tastes good and feels healthy - I guess this would be your go to! Definitely a yummy scramble, a bit heavy on the sodium for me. I love avocado so this dish was great.The restrooms here are spacious and clean, but dark. Prices are standard Boston prices - expect about $15 per person. There is street parking available. Good for kids, dates, and I think they can accommodate for larger parties (6-12 people). Lots of booth seating and cute brick walls for your photo needs.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"Worth the walk. My Italian grinder was great. My wife loved her sirloin mac and cheese. Good service, good beer selection for a small spot. Would definitely recommend.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"My FAVORITE restaurant in Boston.I stumbled upon milkweed one day and I've fallen in love with the place ever since. Every time I eat at Milkweed, I think to myself, why don't I come here every week. The food is wonderful- it's fresh, unique, and well prepared. The prices are unbeatable! The decor inside is soo beautiful, with exposed brick and bright windows letting in light(and allowing for optimal people/puppy watching. Lastly, the service alone makes me want to be a regular, the waitresses are always so friendly, attentive and just generally kick ass women! This time around, I ordered the fresh berry pancakes ($9) that had generous strawberries and blueberries inside AND on top. My brother got the breakfast power bowl ($11) . Despite teasing him at first for his order, i found Â myself stealing bite after bite from him. It was. A large portion, generous with veggies. The dressing was DELICIOUS (if they sold this in jars I would buy it in bulk) it has the perfect hint of tahina. The beets and sweet potato were so good- and he loved the combo of his runny egg and quinoa.  Lastly, the restaurant was impressively clean! The bathrooms were immaculate, and the half open kitchen afforded us the ability to see how spotless it was (bonus you can watch your food being cooked if you sit at the counter).",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"Love this place! After discovering Milkweed, I come way too often! This place is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even though I've only had their breakfast/brunch menu, I have not been disappointed. Â The service is pretty good especially Holly who also makes the love muffins! Shout out to Holly! Milkweed is located in the Mission Hill area which is perfect for college students! Food Review:Love Muffin: A MUST!! It changes everyday and gets sold out toward the afternoon! I've had their chocolate chip, coconut caramel, coconut chocolate chip, strawberry lemonade, and corn muffin (All great by the way)! Â They cut the muffin in half, grill it, and put a huge lump of butter on top! It's the perfect combination of warm/crispy on the edges and soft/buttery in the middle! Â If you want to find out what is today's love muffin, check their instagram (@milkweedboston)! Powerbowl: The powerbowl is really filling and makes you feel a little healthier as you also eat a love muffin. Â It consists of quinoa, mixed greens, beets, roasted chickpeas, sweet potatoes, pumpkin seeds, creamy dressing, and a sunny side egg. Â Pancakes: I've had their chocolate chip, lucky charms, and berry's pancake. My favorite are the berry pancakes which consist of 3 thick fluffy pancakes with strawberries and blueberries. My coworker loves their Lucky charm pancakes, but I was a little disappointed since there weren't many charms in the pancake. Â When I had the lucky charm pancakes, there was a sudden morning rush where everyone came at once so they were backed up in the kitchen.Morning Madness: If you're extremely hungry, this is a great choice! It consist of 2 slices of french toast, eggs any style, home fries, ham, sausage, and bacon. Â The home fries were very crispy and garnished with scallions. Â If you want to switch out something, they would always be willing to do so. Â It is a super heavy set breakfast.Bacon Avocado Scramble: This scramble consisted of smoked bacon, mushroom, tomatoes, scallion, blue cheese, and avocado! The scramble was solid, but nothing interesting about it. Iced Coffee: I love their iced coffee! It's very smooth and creamy!! A large is only $3 which is really affordable! The Ambiance: It has a yellow/black industrial modern vibe! One side has tables and on the other side has benches. Â It gets really busy and loud which could be difficult when you're trying to catch up with friends. Â If you want to come during the weekend, there will be a long line so get there early.Overall, I love this place! It is cute, modern, and affordable! I definitely will keep coming back to this place and would not mind trying out their lunch and dinner meals.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"4,"My friend was driving to her apartment in Roxbury Crossing when this restaurant caught my eye from the window. The outside of restaurant looks pretty modern and high class compared to the other neighborhood takeout places next door. Walking inside, it gives off a cute, modern, vibe. Small tables on one side, the other side contained benches with little light lamps dangling down. Color scheme was mainly black and yellow. A lot of breakfast business meetings were happening here. I was shocked how busy it was for a Tuesday morning. My friend and I actually had to wait for a table. Â Food review:I ended up getting the italian omelet which consisted of a mixture of italian meats, tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese with a balsamic drizzle over the omelet. The balsamic drizzle gave it the perfect hint of sweet to the salty combination from the meats. One of my favorite omelets i've had so far. The home fries were perfect, crispy and well seasoned. Summary:Cute, busy little restaurant, definitely a fan of their breakfast, wouldn't mind going to try their lunch and dinner meals!Cons:The service honestly could have been better, the server asked me how I liked my food before I was even able to try it. We had to wave the server done for our check.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"Loved the place. I think the shakshuka here might actually be better than the one at Tatte; which is incredible. We also got the chorizo sausage omelette which was average.The place gets 5 stars because the vibe was great, service was great and they have this toasted muffin with butter that was really great! Also, for some reason get the side of sausage totally hit the spot.Parking is tough but findable and the wait is around 30 minutes.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"5,"Milkweed is a great spot near Northeastern's campus.Highly recommend the shakshuka with meatballs! It's a huge portion and worth the price. The fresh toast with Nutella and strawberries were also amazing!  Just know that there isn't that much seating in the restaurant. If you are a party of 2, you'll most likely be seated at the bar-like area or next to each other by the windows. We waited about 20-30 min on Sunday at noon. Service was really great too!",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"4,"This place was pretty darn delicious! I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but glad I decided to check it out anyway. I had two local oysters ($3.25 each), and they were plump, briny, and succulent. My coworker had the spinach and artichoke dip which she said was ok, and I had the shrimp and crab dip which I also thought was ok (a bit bland, but good amount of crab). For our main dish, I sprung for the Portuguese Stew ($17.95), which was chock full of clams, mussels, white fish of some sort, shrimp, and chorizo. It also had kale, potatoes, and tomatoes. It was such a lovely, filling dish - could have been spicier or perhaps more flavorful, but overall really nice. My coworker had the Fish n Chips ($17.95), which apparently is battered in chickpea flour. She said it was perfectly flaky and tasty. Lastly, you just can't beat the view! There are three floors and sadly we only got to experience one, but the rooftop looked pretty cool. I loved being able to sit outside in beautiful summer Boston weather which enjoying delicious seafood.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"2,"View from the rooftop was very nice, but I wouldn't go back just for that. The view is just as nice from the bottom floor at one of the other local places that have nicer price points for their food & drink. We ended up not eating because the rooftop menu is limited to sushi and one or two other items. Sort of silly that it's so limited when they could easily bring up at least the appetizers from the main menu. We did however enjoy our sangrias and the view for the time we were there.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"Fun during sunset if you can get a seat upstairs. It was really packed when we went, and it was a little hard finding a place to sit but we found 2 seats. We ordered oysters, sushi, and sangria. Interesting mix of menu items. The sangria was good (prob could use some more alcohol in it, as always). Oysters were fresh. Sushi was decent. Service was lackluster. Our waitress just took forever with everything, and it was tough getting her attention. Bathrooms were nice! Overall, good times because of the location and view.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"My first meal in Boston and it didn't disappoint! We wanted seafood right on the bay and this place was awesome. My only complaint was that 2/3 floors were closed for a private event, leaving an almost two hour wait time. BUT, You can sit at the bar or the counter with a full service menu and thankfully we were able to snag one of those seats! I enjoyed a fresh yellowfin tuna steak with jasmine rice and a summer squash & zucchini mix that was phenomenal. The tuna was market price and a little expensive but it was worth it for fresh fish! My family also enjoyed the fresh clam steamers and the lobster casserole, both of which were also excellent. A great stop for a first night in Boston!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"MAKE A RESERVATION FAR IN ADVANCE, especially on weekends. I was very lucky and made a reservation on Open Table for a party of 3 at 7pm on a Saturday on the second floor. The sunset views over the harbor are beautiful. Everything is pricy, but it's always nice to splurge once in a while.Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. The ""Agave Old Fashioned"" cocktail was DELICIOUS - Smokey flavor with a grapefruit peel in it. Great wine list as well.All of the entrees were absolutely delicious. I had the salmon, my boyfriend had the bouillabaisse seafood stew (spicy!) and my friend had the scallops - All are recommended! Food also came out super fast.Parking is a hassle!

Younger crowd and a really good time.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"A very good meal, experience. Went before Lucinda Williams concert.We were seated inside but near the outdoor deck so the view was nice. I had a salad with shrimp, wife had a lobster roll. Both excellent.I recommend.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"Overall, prices were fair, food was fresh and tasty, service was slow. We came here on a Thursday night--booked it the night before without any issues. The top two floors were closed for a private event, so we didn't get to check them out. We ended up just getting a bunch of different items--crab & pepperoni pizza, Hawaiian roll, clam pasta, and crab cake. Everything was very tasty!The crab and pepperoni pizza definitely had a good amount of crab and the flavor came through even with the pepperoni. We had them bring some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little. The Hawaiian roll was fresh and tasty and a good size. Crab cake was chunky and looked like a crab biscuit--lots of meat! It was delicious and I liked that it came with a little salad to have in between bites. The pasta was really good. Whatever cheese/cheeses they use have a nice little bite and the pasta was cooked well.Service was notably slow. We weren't in a hurry and had ordered a bottle of wine that we were able to keep pouring, so we didn't really mind. The table behind us actually had a guy get up and go into the kitchen area to get their server back to their table. The views were great; we sat outside on the covered patio. The inside was nice and clean and there is seating at the sushi bar and actual bar. Would definitely go back!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was awesome. The staff all signed a birthday card for me, and even obliged a special request from my boyfriend to have a framed picture of cards making black jack (I'm 21) and a Dirty Dancing scene (my favorite movie). Yes, yes he did that. We also were able to have an entire booth to ourselves(big enough for probably like 6 people), facing the waterfront view. I definitely felt very special with all of these extra miles.Now, it was my 21st birthday, let's talk the cocktail. I asked the waiter to recommend one of their signature cocktails that was on the sweeter side, and to be honest I forget the exact name but I'm pretty sure it had pineapple and tequila. It was reasonably priced considering the upscale vibe and the food prices, and it definitely was NOT a weak or overly fruity drink despite me asking for something sweet. Woo!As far as the food, everything was tasty, but I did kind of regret ordering the scallops with cous cous dish. Something about the cous cous paired with peas and scallops just wasn't the best complement and it wasn't bad but I was left wanting something more. The salmon dish was great, and the TRUFFLE FRIES! Honestly, as a younger person, I don't like to spend too much on food, so it has to be worth it, and I really don't know that my entree was worth the price, but the truffle fries and the drinks...definitely. I would say if you are more budget conscious you can definitely have a fun time here ordering appetizers and drinks. That's pretty great considering you are probably already expecting to mostly be paying for the premium location.There is a sushi bar and rooftop bar combo on the top floor, and I didn't check out the sushi menu but the rooftop had a cool atmosphere and I'd definitely check out the food at the sushi bar next time for a more laid back feel.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"This place was really cool, went here last night. It's huge, I believe there are multiple floors that are each different (I think the top is a rooftop bar with small bites). We went to the first floor, the host told us it'd be over an hour for a table inside or out. We then wandered around the bar looking for seating and a waitress asked if we were looking for a table and sat us at one in the bar area. Random but great. They had a good drink list including ""Harborside Special"" drafts from Harpoon and Sam Adams. We started with the shrimp margherita pizza which was excellent. I ordered the burger (at a seafood restaurant, I know) which was also good. It wasn't until we paid our checks that I realized this was a Legal Sea Foods.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"2,"We had dinner on a Friday evening with a reservation of five people, two weeks ahead of time at 7pm on the first level of the restaurant. Â The restaurant is modern, chic, and has an amazing open floor plan maximizing all seats to look out towards the waters. Â The walls adjacent to the sea do open up completely allowing a great view and fresh air into the restaurant. Â We sat on the second row of tables closest to the water. Â There were some docked boats with their engines idling. Â We got a constant whiff of exhaust fumes all night. Â If engine fumes are your thing, I suggest sitting further away from the open deck. I ordered the cucumber collins for my drink. Â It was incredibly refreshing and not too sweet for me and i usually like my scotch neat. Â Others ordered some beers on tap. Â Our appetizers included the fried calamari, saucey shrimp kabob, crab cake, and the artichoke dip. Â All were on point, I especially liked the fried calamari - it was fried to perfection. Â Entrees for the table included two dishes from the specials that evening; the grouper and the scallop. Â Entrees from the menu included the Portuguese seafood stew, Anna's baked Boston cod, and one specialty request: salmon over salad.I had the scallop entree, it was cooked to perfection on the grill. Â The sliced tomato and mozzarella with a dab of balsamic glaze was on point. Â I tried the grouper entree from the special. Â The first thing i noticed was the taste Freezer Burn. Â Someone else from our table tried it and confirmed. Â  Â I tried the a shrimp from the Portuguese Stew, it was overcooked to the point of rubbery. Â The sauce and flavoring of the stew was good with a strong taste of alcohol. Â I tried a bite of Anna's baked cod, it was cooked perfectly, the crumbles on top added to the texture. Â I didn't try the specialty request of salmon over salad, it looked standard.Desserts we ordered included the ice cream bon bons and peanut butter parfait. Â Who doesn't love ice cream bon bons? Â The parfait was too sweet for me as I don't have much of a sweet tooth. Â Overall, I would go back for the view, drinks, and appetizer. Â The ambiance is amazing during warm weather.

Â We made up combos for dinner -- clams & shrimp and clams & fish. Â A little more seasoning than expected but very tasty and delicious. Â Cheesecake for dessert to top it off.Valet was $21, which is well worth it. Â The area is very busy after a show, but we didn't have to wait too long for our car.

But with the ambiance and service, I had to give this place top marks. We requested a table on their open deck on a perfect day. Nothing beats eating outside along the harbor during a Boston summer so that definitely bumped it up a couple points. But aside from that, here's a run down of what we ordered ---For appetizers we got the Harborside Tempura Lobster Roll, the BLT Roll (Bacon, Lettuce, Tuna), New England Whole-Belly Clams. I'd definitely recommend the lobster maki both for presentation and taste. The BLT was honestly pretty weird, and I would not get it again. Bacon, raw fish, and rice just isn't a combo that works. And you can't go wrong with fried clams. For entrees, I ordered the Char Grilled Rainbow Trout with a side of zucchini & summer squash and jasmine rice. The others ordered a Lobster Roll, Grilled Swordfish Gyro and Tuna Tacos. I didn't try the dishes, but they all looked mad good.For my dish, the rice was a little salty, but the fish was perfectly cooked. It would've been off the charts if the fish skin was a little crispier. But other than that, it was dankkkk. After dinner, we moved upstairs to the roof deck and had a couple drinks. Again, picking the perfect day to come to the waterfront goes a long way...",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,First time going to the rooftop. It has an amazing view of Boston and it was also the perfect weather to go for a drink. I went with my bf for a going away get together for his co worker who is leaving to another state. I've been to this place before but it was only for dinner and we were in the outside patio which also has a great view and a little boardwalk that you can walk while looking at the seaport view and you can also see the airport from there. It was packed since it was graduation day. But this time wasn't really packed and it was my first time on the roof top as well so it was really coolTo go there. The waitress that took care of us was really nice too. I didn't get to take a look at the menu since we just asked her some suggestions on what to get and we only got drinks as well. We stayed for until like early midnight since we got work early the next day. Would love to come back soon with friends.,Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"Great dinner and great view. Â  Right on the harbor. Â There we 7 of us and after a recommendation by our server Cassidy who was awesome, 6 of us ordered the Lobster Rolls and 1 had a salad. Â We also ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese. Â Excellent! Â  Large pieces of lobster meat in Â both items. Â The cocktails were very good and the pours as well. Â Food came out fast and was outstanding. Â Wished I lived here so I could come back again and again. Â Most of the seats and tables had water views so a great place to come enjoy good food and good views!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"3,"(Park Lane Garage) Parking validation = $2 discount. I was told two hours free but was charged the full amount for approx 1 hr 30 m less $2. Not sure who the liar is, the restaurant hostess or the parking gate attendant. Aside from that disappointment, the waterfront views were Amazing but the food was just okay. Nothing mind blowing with the flavors, but decent for what it is. The lobster roll was a bit disappointing, tasted bland and salty, and the fries came out cold...wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't get it again. The clam chowder, however, was very good and I'd recommend getting that. It is a bit pricey for the 8 oz portion though. The clam pizza was very salty. The the pizza itself seemed fine but the clam bits were extremely salty. Also, the pizza is more of an arugula pizza like another reviewer pointed out. The pizza is pretty big and is more of an entree unless you're splitting it among 4-5 people. It's a bit odd the pizza is cut into squares and not triangular slices. Complimentary dinner rolls are provided so keep that in mind if you're unsure about appetizers or small plates.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"First time here in Boston and made it a point to make sure I get the clam chowder. I was only here for a few hours but this place was pretty awesome. When I first walked in, it was really busy and well maintained. I heard there's massive lines to get into this place. FOOD ORDERED:NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER: Holy cow let me tell you that this stuff was amazing! By far the best clam chowder I've ever had. It had tons of meat inside with a great taste to the soup. Added some oyster crackers, pepper, and Tabasco and it's a little bit of heaven in every bite. SERVICE:Service at the bar wasn't great but wasn't bad. The bartenders weren't very chatty or anything but could've been because it was kind of busy. The view from upstairs is gorgeous. That's my favorite part about bars is the outside and rooftop. I would definitely come here again especially for the clam chowder!! Wish they had a bigger bowl option though!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"This place was delicious! A Boston native recommended that I try Legal Seafoods during a day trip to the city. I know Boston is known for seafood, and I had never been before, so I knew I wanted to try a lobster roll amongst other things. I sat by myself at the bar and was waited on by a really friendly waiter (I don't remember his name, but he was awesome). I ordered a dozen oysters and had him pick a variety of different ones so that I could taste the difference. I also ordered the lobster roll and a glass of Pinot Grigio. Everything was incredible - fresh and delicious. I feel like I got a real taste of what seafood should be. Legal Harborside also has an amazing rooftop that looks out over the harbor. Although I didn't get to go up there bc it was rented out by a party, I did walk around the restaurant after I left to take in the views. Overall, great food, great location, great staff, great experience!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"5,"The fantastic service and the anbience is what brings me to give this place five stars. We were seated right next to the water outside. Our server had great recommendations and was super attentive. The bacon-wrapped scallop appetizer was so delicious, especially the creamy polenta and mushrooms, and I definitely could have stopped there for my meal. I also had the lobster mac n cheese which was really flavorful with a generous portion of lobster. My mom doesn't eat seafood, but she ordered the burger and loved it.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"When I'm Boston, eat seafood! My friends and I were attending a conference at the Boston Convention Center and received several recommendations to eat at Legal Harborside. It's about a 10 minute walk from the convention center and not difficult to find - a plus for tourists.On a nice day, this place can get packed. The wait to be seated in the dining area/outside would have been 1.5-2 hours, so we opted to sit at the bar. There are several bar seating areas - sushi bar, drinks bar, and a bar right next to the kitchen. We ended up sitting at the bar right by the kitchen and we were rewarded with a beautiful view of the harbor (check out my picture!).Food was delicious. I ordered the fish and chips and the fish was breaded so nicely - not too thick like many places do. The seafood is so fresh! I had a bite of my friends' lobster rolls and my eyes fed me the rest of the menu items. I don't think there's a certain thing you could go wrong with on the menu!Service was good - a little slow due to the large number of people, but nothing that made for a poor dining experience. If you're visiting Boston, definitely stop at Legal Harborside!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"4,"It's been a stressful week at work and so I picked a place that would get me a good burger and had decent options for booze. The restaurant is quite loud (almost too loud) but they took our name for a 15 minute wait and by the time we were seated, the rowdiness had calmed down a bit.We got the fried pickles to start. Super hot, thin slices that were battered and served with a tangy dipping sauce. Quite yummy, really.For main course, I chose the ""Fire In The Hole Burger"" which came with all sorts of spicy stuff including fried jalapenos and a buffalo sauce. It didn't stick together too well but the sauce that fell out went well with the fries.Great service, they were very happy to continue taking our money as we ran up a pretty solid bill for booze. Enjoyable times, good music.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"4,"This is a fun place! I've been a couple times now and have gotten cast iron mac and cheese both times: once a pulled pork mac and once the lobster mac. I've also gotten the fried pickles. All of the food was excellent and the service was very good.The place is small and can get pretty loud, so I'd avoid it if that's something that bothers you. The names of a lot of the items were cutesy in a way that would make me feel embarrassed to read them aloud, but that's not a huge issue.Overall, it's a nice place and I'd recommend checking it out if it sounds like your jam.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"2,"Don't bothah! Â The service was great - the waitron with the dark hair, cool eye-liner and lots of ink - whose name I don't recall - was great and the only reason they're getting two stars.Other than that - I hated this place.The food is over-priced drech - I won't bore you with the details, but, trust me on this.The draft beer selection is meh. The cocktails are expensive, stingy and weak. Â I don't mind paying for something well-done, so it's not the price. Â It's the price without the quality that I object to. Â And don't get me stahted on the silly nicknames they give to the food - some kind of speakeasy baby talk - it just adds insult to injury. Â I don't really know what they're going for, here, but they're missing the target by a long shot. Â There are tons of other places in the area - go there, save yourselves!",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"5,"So I kind of had to drag my wife here after seeing 'On Your Feet' at the Boston Opera House.Go to the fifth paragraph if you just want to read about the bar.First she didn't want to be in Temple St so because of the people there that late (which at worse was an annoying drunk couple). Second she didn't want to ask about if they were serving food, because this is awkward and that's not something she does well with.Honestly though, it was a little confusing because they had their full menu until 10pm, and then there's a snack menu from 11p-1a. She had a point, but I argue that it's dumb to close the kitchen for an hour just to open it up again for 2 hours. She begrudgingly agrees to go in if I ask, and shockingly I was right.So the bar is somewhat dim-lit, great open atmosphere with high ceilings and exposed brick. The artwork on the wall is kind of a steam-punk style portraits of famous musicians. I also enjoy the music playing here, popular rock songs of the 90's and early 2000's with some old school rap thrown in. I'm at home here.What to eat? I opt for the T-money Mac n' Cheese which had caramelized onions, and sauteed mushrooms. Oh it was delicious. I was left a little hungry after I was done with it. My wife got Lyrics Boujee Brownie; nutella, cream cheese, scoop vanilla ice cream with raspberries and blackberries. She couldn't finish it so I dived in. I was satiated after that! OH and the food was served in these little cast iron pans, hot out of the oven. Delightful!We only ordered a cider and a beer, but there's plenty of options for drinks. It's a good spot in the theatre district to get a bite after a show, and you won't go broke eating here!",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"2,"I give them 2 stars for very good service and crispy delicious sweet potato fries but their CORE meal, the grass ged burger is waaay too salty, I still can't get that off my palate. Â the place is also very dark, had trouble reading menu and the music (at noon time) is annoyingly loud. Â Metal like. Â Lots of potential but need to tweak things a bit.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"5,"Came here for the first time on Friday Feb 23, 2018 and was really impressed. It took about 20 minutes or so to get seated as it was incredibly busy. The service was super friendly though.My friend and I ordered the duck poutine (fries, duck gravy, cheese, with a fried egg on top) to split for an appetizer. It was some of the best comfort food I've ever had. Would highly recommend. I think the fried egg on top is their own interpretation of the dish though, because I'd never seen that on poutine before. For an entree I got the fried chicken sando (lettuce, tomato, gouda, pickles, pop's Russian dressing) with fries for $17 and my friend got a burger (not sure which) and sweet potato fries. The burger was great and the fries were just okay, would recommend the sweet potato fries over the regular fries, much tastier.For a dessert, I got the Lyric's Boujee Brownie (Nutella and cream cheese brownie, vanilla ice cream, strawberries, Nutella drizzle, and caramel sauce) for $8. I loved both the name and the actual dish itself. Overall was extremely impressed with everything . Would definitely come back (especially for dessert).",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"4,"Our first restaurant on our mini vacation to Boston! It was great! Really good burgers and a great beer selection. I got both of their nitro stouts that they offered, and I enjoyed them both. We both got their 8oz burger which was extremely juicy and cooked perfectly, grill marks included. We also shared the cast iron mac and cheese which did not disappoint with the cheese pull. It was a little awkward standing at the front podium for as long as we did before a server came to help us out, but our server for the night was attentive and quick. Music was a little too loud for conversation, but I will say they play some choice songs. A cool place to get late night food/drinks. No wonder JM Curley is almost on every Boston burger list because they do them right.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"1,$15 a cocktail now. It looks like a chain restaurant. The food quality has plummeted. And not one bartender is even remotely friendly. I miss the days when Darren worked here. This place has become the absolute worst.,Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"1,Sorry - not very good. Ordered the burger that has buffalo sauce and peppers on it. Showed up luke warm. Music so loud you couldn't hear anything. Very mediocre and probably the most boring burger ever. Overpriced at $20. Very plain and very ordinary. No one offered an alternative considering my plate was barely touched.,Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"5,"Just had a great lunch! Great service and wicked fresh, tasty food. Don't pay attention to the one stars reviews written by people who literally have only written one review on their Yelp account. Smells fishy to me. We almost turned away because of those and we are so glad we didn't. The BEST part about this place is they had Sip of Sunshine beer ON TAP! Which is so hard to find. What a great beer. I had the skillet Mac and cheese which I told my fiancÃ© was hands down the best Mac and cheese I've ever had (and I've had ALOT of Mac and cheese). It was the perfect portion and perfect amount of cheesy inside with crispy on the top. Great flavor.My fiancÃ© had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and fried pickles and enjoyed his. He did mention that it was a bit ""saucy"" and could have had more actual meat in it. It was difficult to eat because it was so saucy. Overall, great experience and we were so happy we found it. Awesome urban atmosphere with amazing food and beer make for a great Saturday lunch!",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"4,"Pretty decent burger and Mac and cheese entree as well. Good beer and wine menu, although they were out of several of the more I treating beer options. Service was a little spotty at times. We had to flag our waitress down one time we wanted another drink and then order through someone else the second time because we couldn't find our waitress. Also, I understand a bar playing music, but it was way too loud, and the selection of primarily hip hop/rap (even though I love hip hop and rap) didn't seem to fit the vibe of this place. Food was reasonably priced and was definitely tasty.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"4,"We came here to avoid the lines downtown for St. Patrick's Day. They didn't have any tables available but we got some space at the bar. I had the Nuthouse cocktail which was delicious, and strong enough for the $14 price tag. For my meal, I had the T-Money Mac which tasted delicious and fresh. Bartenders were friendly and attentive and the atmosphere of the place is nice. A few times the music got super loud for some reason which made it hard to talk to my friends but overall, it was a pretty chill atmosphere. I would come back to try more if I'm in the area again.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"5,"Wow...service, food, atmosphere is exactly what you want if you come from out of town or live m DT door. Paul the manager is one of the nicest! I called ahead as they were closing to put a last minute food order in. Had a table waiting even in a busy bar. Super accommodating. 5oz Grass Fed was melt in your mouth amazing. Caramelized onions were perfection. Fries are hand cut and salted to perfection. Beer menu is long and drinks aren't weak. Get it!",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"3,Solid Bar food. Nice staff. It is a good place to grab a drink and some food before you do something downtown.,Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"4,"It may not look like much from the outside, but please believe that you need to visit JM Curleys. Their food is a level up (as is their service, and talent behind the bar). Try the burger, fried chicken sandwich, or their cast iron macaroni & cheese. You won't leave disappointed.I'd give it 5 stars if their was a little more standing room, but as I said above, you won't leave disappointed.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"4,Awesome vibes and great food! They have a huge selection of beer and pub food. The difference is the pub food is actually really good. The Mac and cheese bowls are huge and rich of flavor. Definitely worth checking out,Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"3,"I understand restaurants dimming the lights to make for a more intimate setting, but honestly if you need a flashlight to read the menu, I think it's a little too dark. We went with a big group for a birthday, so they sat us in the back of the restaurant in their ""biggest"" booth. We were cramped, and basically sat sideways in the booth. The music was also blasting so it was impossible for the waiter to hear us. Also, they charged a $15 cake cutting fee -- which most restaurants do. But if you are going to charge this fee, make sure your waiter knows what he's doing. Ours decided to pass out all the plates and forks BEFORE bringing out the cake. That not only ruins the surprise of the cake for the birthday girl, but also how do you expect to cut and serve the cake? After we sang and blew out the candles, he took the cake to cut and then realized he had no plates to put them on... was this your first birthday bruh?The food and drinks were good though. A very extensive beer and cocktail menu, which is always a plus. We ordered the duck poutine, burger, and loaded mac and cheese with pulled pork. You definitely feel terrible about yourself when you leave but that is expected.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"3,"Not really worth the hype in my opinion! The bbq sandwich was good but honestly really overpriced for the quality of the food. I paid $40 for a lunch for two worth $20. Also our waitress was not really attentive, but that could be because we came 30mins after opening for lunch.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"2,"Wow, what a decline. A recent Saturday lunch was absolutely abominable.Although service was friendly and prompt, the food was terrible.The 5oz burger with an extra pattie added was the definition of a hockey puck (two in his case)between a bun. Saved only by a massive spoonful of special sauce, the meat was dry and unseasoned - not a hint of juices on the entire plate. Talk about a frozen burger out of a box, a good ole bubba burger would easily surpass the sad excuse for a burger that was served this past Saturday in all ways.Two times the word inedible is used when describing two separate hamburgers by two separate parties.The tater tots had an over oily essence included. Change the oil. Problem solved.Formerly one of the better spots in the area, currently not recommendable.",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"4,"This place looks like a dive. It's low lit, and to be honest if you're walking on the street, you can easily pass by it as there are no fancy signs and the windows are dark. However, when you go in and sit down and look at that menu, you know you want to get their burgers! They have their standard burger and a burger special. They also have other specials on their chalkboard.The burger is awesome. It's a great blend of beef that is packed with flavor. It also has a moistness to it because they cook the patty perfectly. It's a tad small i guess? but that's what the fries are for. They have a decent beer selection to help you wash down that burger. I want to say the best part of the burger (aside from the beef) is the pickles. They are perfectly sliced and complement the burger with some acidity to cut the fattiness of the burger.The fries were crisped perfectly. They offered truffle fries as a special, but i was unable to swap out my regular fries for truffle ones (they should allow substitutions for a fee). The bbq pork sandwich was just aiite. THe sandwich itself was good but the bread flavor was too overpowering. The menu also stated rye, but it tasted more like pumpernickel. Still it was good. and toasted and flavorful. I'll be back for the burger and beer",Jm Curley,"21 Temple Pl Boston, MA 02111"4,"Brendan and Becca: Have stopped by The Tip Tap Room several times for a beer after work. Their beer list is extensive which is phenomenal, but the beers can be relative pricey as one might expect when there are a lot of craft beer options. Never had any food here, so we hope to update this review some time in the future. We expect good things.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"5,Boom! Stop and go here!

Great atmosphere and street view.,The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,"The crowd here is a bit brotastic here given its location on the back side of Beacon Hill, but there's no denying that this is a lively, atmospheric place to hang out. There's a small amount of tables along the sides of the venue and towards the back, as well as a large open floor that provides standing room for folks shut out of seats.Perhaps the best feature about this place is the large, well-curated beer menu which, when I stopped by, included some good sours like a Destihl Flanders Red. Service from the bartenders is super quick, efficient, and professional. In addition to booze, there's also a decent menu. It won't be haute cuisine, but it's also a notch above standard pub fare. Overall, a boisterous place to hang out on a weekend night. Don't forget to nod or tip your cap towards the corner of the room where there's a mural of former Boston mayors holding court over the entire venue. RIP, Mayor Menino - you changed the face of Boston for the better while never forgetting the people that make it such a beautiful place.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"2,"A Little OddI came here recently and enjoyed their beer selection. They have a nice selection of local, national, and international beers. Unfortunately, the atmosphere isn't one that I prefer. It's very wide open and sterile feeling. The kind of place you expect many suits to come after getting off work in the financial district. Nothing necessarily wrong with it, but not my preference. I didn't have the chance to eat any of the main meals (just an order of Brussel Sprouts and giant cauliflower head) the apps were just ok. Â The weirdest part is our bartender had to have the worst personality and the place has like 40 beers on tap, but no one was drinking them. Â The place has amazing beer and the bartenders are stuck making these 10 ingredient cocktails to their displeasure. Â It's like the place has a personality crisis. Â While we are getting the cold shoulder, the manager is worried about folding napkins. Â He seemed totally useless. Â Odd place, sorry but it was quite evident. Â Thanks",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Absolutely love the ambiance here & their amazing vegetable dishes. Stand-outs are the Cauliflower (whole roasted / crispy garlic / citrus & cumin vinaigrette) & the Burrata (mushroom & herb vinaigrette / oven roasted beets chive / garlic crouton / toast points).

Refilling drinks while we waited for number three to arrived and then clearing the tables when we were done.I chose the day's special, a ""Wild Boar Tacos"" which was two nice sized tortillas topped with lettuce, salsa and cilantro with a nice amount of pulled pork aka ""wild boar."" Tasty and tangy with the pureed avocado, two was enough for lunch. Three for dinner would be about right.Nice spot, definitely worth returning in the evening hours.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Fantastic spot to come for brunch in Boston! We had a reservation, but at 11am on a Sunday it looked like anyone could've gotten in without a wait (which is surprising now that I know how good the food is).We started with some mimosas, and then sharing a plate of their french toast donut holes. The mimosas were delicious, and definitely a bit on the strong side, but who doesn't want that?? The French toast donut holes were a DREAM! they were so crispy on the outside and soft in the center. The flavor was incredible with cinnamon, and a bit of fruitiness from the blackberries inside. It's served over some light cream and caramel, which added so much! For an entree, my friend and I chose to split the eggs Benedict. First of all, I adore this restaurant because they gave us our own plates and own potatoes, each with one Benny on it. Then the Benedict itself was DELICIOUS? the eggs were poached to perfection, the hollandaise was so rich and so good, and it was served on the best English muffin of my life.The service was fast and the food was incredible - I think I need to buy tickets to Boston just to eat here again!",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,Great beer selection and food options. Whats even better is the service - sit at the bar and they will let you try a bunch of beers to find what you like best before ordering. Highly recommend for a chill place to have great local beers.,The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Was visiting Boston and had seen the yelp reviews of this place. Oh my god, this was definitely the place to be! The Tip Tap Room has a generous offering of beers on tap, and several ""tip"" dishes (steak tips, tofu tips, turkey tips, etc). We chose the pork tenderloin tips and the tofu tips (served with a grain like quinoa or paella). The pork tenderloin tips was one of my favorite meals I've ever had. Period. Cooked perfectly, the paella was amazing, everything paired so well with each other. It was perfect. Service was quick and very attentive. Would recommend and cannot wait to return.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,"I was so full when I ate here. You're welcome everyone. Baked brie - ooooey gooey molten center I highly recommend trying it at least once. I know brie is expensive but I thought the price was high, or that the portion was too big... I know it's a sin to say too big, but I really think it is meant to be shared by more than two people, so just split the cost and it's not too shabby.Gnocchi - well cooked and delicious in whatever that sauce was. I enjoyed the pumba (wild boar) that accompanied it and it was simply a solid meal.Rib Tips - Oh heaven these were yummy, the sauce complimented it very well, and the meat was cooked perfectly medium rare. Juicy after juicy bite and I could not stop eating even though my stomach was in severe pain.Mashed potatoes - were gross. But that was my own fault. I did not read the menu, apparently, there is horseradish in them... guess who hates horseradish? Any sane person. Beer was a perfect compliment to the meat.THE VERDICT:Do not think this will be on my list of places to return to in Boston. It was good though, and if you are in Boston a lot, I highly recommend trying it, you might find yourself a new favorite spot. Besides the rib tips and brie I cannot say I love anything else.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,"I live down the street from Tip Tap Room, so I love the convenience of it. Â I haven't explored the menu too in depth, but my all time favorite item is the everything bagel brunch entree. Â It is a very toasted everything bagel smothered in horseradish cream cheese, steak tips, hollandaise sauce and arugula. Â This dish is incredibly hard to eat without it spewing everywhere. Â Extra napkins are a requirement. Â I've learned to do kind of an open face and try to cut it with a steak knife. Â The price is about $14, and you get a ton of food.

Â It was very unique, but not sure if I would order it again.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Excellent! Went here recently with a big group and everyone loved their food.

The fries are also awesome. Would definitely recommend.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,"We came around 7pm on a Friday and the place was PACKED and kinda noisy! Luckily they were able to seat us at the bar and we squeezed 3 people in for a seating arrangement meant for 2. The cocktails were delicious! If you love your fun combinations, the Tip Tap Room is going to hook you up! There are at least 2 different drinks with elderflower in them (my weakness), so I was a super happy camper. The entrees were also very solid and very generous!Pork Tips: The chorizon paella was tasty, and the pork was well-cooked but a bit bland. The meat definitely could have been better seasoned/marinated. Swordfish Tips: Super impressed how tasty and juicy this was! They were lightly flavored but oh so delicate in their citrusy goodness. Def recommend!Overall, it was a tasty meal with great service. We left super stuffed and super ready to come back for more next time!",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,Nice restaurant conveniently on Beacon Hill across from the MGH Hospital area. Seems to be local favorite very good brunch menu and burgersI had the steak burger which were ground-state tips and it was pretty good except when you bite into it it's very flavorful it also ended up being very juicy. I ate everything on my plate so definitely had a good meal. I recommend that people come to the area if you want to try some unconventional American food with exotic meats.,The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,"The peach and blackberry sangria were PHENOMENAL! The food was just okay, definitely something you have to be in the mood for- very modern and definitely fresh (the hummus was great for an app). Super busy during night and a good place to hang out!",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"3,"The first time I came here was for a horrible first date wherein the man told me I have a beautiful collar bone and talked to me in a baby voice for 90% of our time together. He made fun of my drink order (WHAT is funny about an Old Fashioned?), implied that I have an eating disorder because I'm vegetarian, and asked if I would be ready to have kids within the year. What... just happened...I left that day thinking I would never come back to The Tip Tap Room because it had been so ruined for me, and I didn't! Until todayMy best friend texted me and asked to go out to lunch and I needed a vegetarian-friendly restaurant close to my job. That has been a struggle for me in the past. TTR popped up and I figured I was long overdue to go back.PROS Ample seating Dim lighting with tons of sunlight Friendly staff (Host/Manager offered to turn down the air conditioning for me because I was cold!)Great menu for vegetarians and carnivores alikeThe food was pretty good (some dishes better than others)CONS The food takes FOREVER to come out. I don't recommend coming here if you are on lunch break. We got there at 12:15 PM and didn't leave until 1:45 PM. We spent most of that time waiting for our food and drinks. Pretty priceyTables are too small if you are going to order more than one plate each.What we ordered:Baked Brie appetizer ($15)- This was our favorite, by far. It was a flaky pastry dough exploding with Brie cheese served with benton's bacon jam (on the side! No meat for me), cipollini, hibiscus spice, macadamia nuts, and rosemary. This was absolutely delicious and a MUST-ORDER item.Brussels Sprouts small plate ($10)- This was decent. The sprouts weren't roasted so they weren't crunchy, but the flavors were good (basil, tomato, garlic croutons, pecorino cheese) and they made them without lardon for me so they were vegetarian-friendly.Panzanella small plate ($11)- Don't bother. It's described as fresh buffalo mozzarella, toasted ciabatta, heirloom tomatoes, Sicilian olives, with basil & white balsamic vinaigrette. There was hardly any cheese or bread; most of the plate was tomato and it was underwhelming. Grilled Corn small plate ($8)- Basically Mexican street corn with cotija cheese, ancho chili crÃ¨me, lime and guajillo. I didn't try this, but my friend said it was very messy, but very good!Wild Boar Shoulder ""Cuban"" sandwich ($16)- Didn't try this (meat) but my friend said it was good. She compared the boar to bacon and said the fries that came with the sandwich were perfectly crispy.DrinksShe said her Mojito was delicious and refreshing.My Old Fashioned wasn't very good. I had a few sips and left the rest. It just tasted off. The total came to $87 which I thought was high considering I only ordered a few small plates. I would probably give them another try next time I'm craving that Brie plate. It was amazing.NOTE: They are known for serving some very gamey, exotic meats. Today's special was CAMEL. Yes, the animal with humps. I know how I feel about that, but carnivores might be interested in checking this place out.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"3,"Great menu, great beer list, mediocre value. They've mostly transitioned away from the fixation on meat tips to the exclusion of all else, but you can still see hints if it on the menu. My gripe isn't with the food, which is delicious. It's the price and serving size - one too high, one too small. If you're not hungry and you have an expense account though, this is a pretty solid option.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"5,"This restaurant has a great atmosphere, with very friendly and accomodating staff! I came here with my extended family to celebrate my sister's birthday. We ordered Â a few appetizers for the table and then each ordered our own entree dish. Each dish came out fresh and very flavorful. You can definitely tell that the ingredients are fresh and the food is prepared to order. I highly recommend the baked brie, steak burger, and au gratin. The grilled corn is also really good, just wish it came with more (maybe a second ear of corn) for a few more dollars. The beer selection was also outstanding, there were plenty of beers from across the U.S. that I had never heard of, but got to try. It seems they're always bringing in mew selections as well.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Tip Tap Room is always a solid choice when bringing out-of-towners to dinner. With an extensive beer selection and a menu with a different meat for every day of the week, everyone can find something here. I am partial to their steak tips which are paired with horseradish mashed potatoes - perfectly done. Service can be a bit slow; the place gets pretty crowded so don't expect to be in and out quickly. Definitely try to get a reservation if possible.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"4,Dont be intimidated by the antelope burger spiced flavorful and great to have w beer Waite staff very knowledgable about beer brands and patiently assisted us to find our desires.

We had reservations and they took us immediately to her table. The staff could not have been nicer nor more attentive. Our server was absolutely dynamite.

No one was disappointed but everyone was full. Perfectly done, tasty, filling.After all was said and done we actually had three people brave enough to attempt dessert after a very filling meal. The desserts were unique and they raved about how good it tasted.We were visiting from New Jersey and California so it's not likely we will be back soon, however, if we get back up to Boston sooner, this one's on the hit list to revisit.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"5,"1. How can you resist Catarina at the bar. The cocktail menu is on point but she'll make you anything you ask for. And bonus: they have Ciroc! 2. Volcano roll is a must-try. 3.

And not too much long after that, or meals came out. Beautiful presentation, hot, and they tasted delicious. The ambiance was nice too. A modern, sleek, and Asian feel. Pricing was affordable also. Although located in the square area, pricing was not ridiculous. Â You can enjoy the local artists while seating outside. Portion sizes are rather large too. Good value for the money, I think. I would definitely eat here again.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"4,"One of the seemingly few restaurants in downtown Boston that has a kitchen open late. Came in very clutch last night. Sat at the bar, they had a good draft selection. Service was good. We had a medley of their apps/sides including the cauliflower, the lobster rangoons and the yucca fries. Everything was excellent.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Restaurant week lunch was great. Avocado slider, bibimbap and flourless chocolate cake Were all very good.

The hostess very rudely said no and that we would have to make a purchase of over $20. While I get the need to control who uses bathrooms in restaurants, but it's not like my son looks like he's menacing and going to do any damage or anything. Â What was even worse than being told no about an 8 year old using a bathroom was the incredibly rude and insensitive attitude of the hostess.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Asian fusion with a good focus on sushi. Nice, dark, quiet. Probably not right for a business dinner but you'd do okay here on a date. The service tonight was excellent and attentive.My dining partner opted for two maki sushi rolls and he enjoyed them. The sure looked good. Colorful and well assembled.I opted for the duck breast. A good portion, lightly cooked and served on top of a yam and goat cheese mash that was very sweet and nicely complimented the duck.A really nice meal.

Good food, but way overpriced for the quality.Food: 5/10Ambiance: 10/10Service: 7/10",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"5,"After volunteering for a fight for air climb for lung cancer at BNY Mellon, a friend and I were starving and wanted a close place by to eat. Koy was only a 5 min walk and was an Asian fusion restaurant with decent reviews so we were willing to give this place a try and I'm so glad we did! We walked in, the place seemed like a romantic vibe, dim lighting, close table booths and high tables by the window were available. I could see this as a cute place for a date. I heard the service was slow but honestly I thought it was average, server got to us right away and gave us the perfect amount of time to look at the menu. Granted place wasn't packed for lunch, a few people were there but not crazy busy but only one server and hostess was working. Food review:Scallion pancakes - the scallion pancakes came out piping hot on a stone plate, the perfect crisp, gorgeous coloring mixture of yellow and red bell peppers in combination with the green scallions. Definitely one of the better scallion pancakes I've had, we literally ate 3 slices each to ourselves, and they were generous sizes. Japchae- clear noodles with a combination of marinated sweet bulgogi beef with onions and yellow peppers, I'm honestly not normally a fan of clear noodles but this dish was beyond amazing and made me more open to clear noodle dishes. Literally almost ate the whole plate to myself. It's a sweet tasting dish, so if you're not a fan of sweet savory dishes then this maybe not for you. Summary:I'm excited that I found this place and can't wait to try other dishes! Pros:-Convenient area with shopping, located close to Faneuil Hall-The two items that I tried were amazing quality -I like the idea that it's Asian fusion so different Asian style foods for everyone's liking Cons:-Average to a little on the pricey side I personally think but food was awesome so I don't mind paying a little extra -The menu I personally didn't think had much compared to other Asian fusion restaurants I've been to but if they can perfect all the items on the menu then well worth it then having a bunch of mediocre food-parking might be difficult unless you want to pay for garages",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"5,"I preordered twice via Grubhub for takeout, and both times it went smoothly. I was able to pick up my order on time as expected. Well worth the price for the quality of the food!One of my favorites is the Angry Chicken. I really like the added spice to it.UPDATE: I've recently tried the Kimchi Fried Rice and it was pretty good. Good to see them add a little spice.. just the way I like it.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Came here for lunch quickly when visiting Boston a WHILE back and thought I'd give it a review! As a native to traditional korean food, I thought this place was okay. The atmosphere is very modernized, and seating is very adequate! Staff were courteous and attentive! Also, they knew their menu well which is awesome! On to the food, I got the KBBQ Bulgogi. It was just ok. In all honesty, there was way too much liquid surrounding the meat, and the meat portion could have been slightly larger, in relation to the price (~$30). Next, I ordered the pork sliders which were amazing! Very juicy, well sauces, and perfect rolls they came on. No complaints here! Very, very delicious! For dessert, I ordered what is known as , or Bingsoo/Bingsu. It's a Korean shaved ice dessert that can be topped with virtually anything you want it to be topped with. The one at Koy was topped with mochi, various fruits, and vanilla ice cream. It was delicious! Overall, not a bad place! Will most likely come back here when I'm ever in Boston again! Parking is street FYI! Pictures of the Bulgogi and Bingsoo down below!",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Everything I have had and my friends have had at this place has been extremely good. Entrees, appetizers, drinks, all so good.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"3,"It was Summer Restaurant Week (or more formally, Dine Out Boston), so we decided to check out Koy by Faneuil Hall for their $20 3 course lunch special during our lunch hour.Service was a bit mixed as it was nearly 35 minutes after we had placed our order that the chef came out to let us know that they were unfortunately out of one of the two appetizers we had selected. Â Then later the fries accompanying the sandwich arrived soft and lukewarm. Â However, they redeemed themselves quite nicely, with a replacement plate of hot (though still soft) fries, apologies from at least 3 different individuals (chef, manager, wait staff), coupons for free dumplings on our next visit, and comping us on one of our two meals. Â They made us feel that our time and inconvenience mattered to them. Â We appreciated it and plan to return to give them another go.They were out of the Tofu Pillows, fried rice, egg, sticky sweet fried tofu, so we ended up getting two orders of the Shrimp Tempura ($14 a la carte) tempura batter, ponzu sauce, scallion, which arrived 3 crisp battered medium sized shrimp apiece. Â This disappeared quite quickly as we were pretty hungry by then.We shared the two entrees which arrived 20 min after the shrimp. Â It was the Short Rib Sandwich, brown sugar + soy braised short rib, house slaw, buttered ciabatta + fries that had been accompanied by the thin cut soft fries. Â The sandwich itself was a bit too fusion for my DC, but it tasted okay to me, though it could have been improved with a heftier portion of meat. Â The Jajangmyun, traditional udon noodle, black bean bolognaise was a bit strong tasting, though the flavor and texture was pleasant. Â It would have been better with more meat and veggies diced into the sauce to somewhat tame the taste.The final course was probably our favorite: Â Coconut Ice Cream ($9 a la carte) lime zest, cinnamon, torched banana. Â The bruleed banana was nicely cooked all the way through without the berry becoming soft and mushy.I've been to restaurants which do not empower their staff, and at those establishments you feel unheard and unvalued as a customer. Â From this experience, I feel that Koy is not one of those restaurants. Â Things can not run perfectly all the time. Â It is how you handle the hiccups that help to differentiate the businesses that care.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"5,"This restaurant has a reeeally cool Asian vibe. Very modern, but also very zen in the decor elements used. Really great option for a date night since the location is cozy and inviting. The artwork on the back wall near the kitchen is incredible!The service was great. Giovanna was readily available and easy to access at all times. She was pleasant to speak with and was eager to offer suggestions and recommendations. The food was served very quickly and the presentation was beautiful. I started with the cheese steak dumplings. To DIE. So gooey and flavorful. It was served with easily one of the best spicy mayo's I've had. I ordered the volcano roll as my entree and just thinking about it makes me salivate. So delicious and fresh! Ending the night with the coconut ice cream and brÃ»lÃ©ed bananas was the best decision I've made. I've read a lot about this dessert from other reviews and to be honest, it lived up to the hype. Coconut ice cream really needs to be a staple are more restaurants.Overall, I was satisfied with my visit! I feel it was fairly priced for what I was served and of course taking into consideration the location. It's definitely a great spot to enjoy if you're ever in the Fanuiel Hall area. I want to come back to try some other eye-catching items as well.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"3,"Koy is centrally and conveniently located in downtown. The interior is modern asian and comfortable. They have a full bar and I saw quiet a lot of cocktails ordered.I went there on a Monday and the place was understandably rather empty. The bartender also had to serve tables which kept her quiet busy but she was nevertheless attentive and nice. The menu offers quiet a good variety along the Korean cuisine. To start off I had cheese steak dumplings (gracias yelp), which were crispy and tasty. Since they were out of the galbitang Â (short rib) I opted to Appa's spicy udon soup served with rice and kimchi. The dish was good but nothing that threw me off the socks. The rice could have been fresher as well as the kimchi. The dish was ok but lacked in well developed flavor. Overall a good experience but I will probably venture out somewhere else next time.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"3,"If you're looking for authentic flavors, this isn't the place, but solid western-style asian fusion.

I highly recommend getting the dumplings and crab rangoon.",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"5,"I've been to Bar Mezzana quite a few times, and I have an amazing experience during each visit.The service is always great, and can recommend a nice glass of wine to pair with your food. Their Paccheri pasta dish is easily one of (if not the) best lobster pasta dish I've ever had. It's so simple, but so flavorful at the same time - I'm not sure how they do it.Their house made mozzarella is also a must try. It tastes so fresh, and pairs perfectly with their classic prosciutto.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"Good but not great or exceptional is the best way for me to categorize the overall experience at Bar Mezzana. It was definitely more like a 3.5 star experience but that isn't an option - so I am going to stick with 3 for one big reason. And that reason is this - my believes steak not only took forever to come out - it was then quite overdone. Because of how long it took to receive my steak, waiting for a new one that was actually cooked medium was just not going to happen. They do get brownie points for removing the 29.00 (a fair price if you ask me) from the bill, but I wish it was done right (I was quite hangry at that point).Despite an initial slow to get served experience, our server ended up being quite amazing and providing a solid experience. The crudo was delicious (we got two - the yellowtail and the striped bass) and the crostini was also quite great (with ricotta with strawberry and lardo). The octopus was good - a nice large thick piece - but the overall prep didn't speak to me for some reason. I think my husband enjoyed the octopus though. He also ordered the beef tartare - and it really didn't look all that appetizing either. I guess we were spoiled by the amazing and delicious tartare at Townsman before they closed (the Drink and Butcher Shop tartares are others I am comparing it to as well). All in all - a good enough for experience that I would come back and hope for a better overall experience. I would probably just be cautious and avoid the meat and stick with the seafood items.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"When we first entered the restaurant, we were greeted by... actually, we weren't greeted by anyone. Fortunately, the only negative aspect of this meal was this interaction with the hosts at the front. After making eye contact with me (the only person at the front desk), the woman and dude with a mustache proceeded to not even say ""hi"" or ""hold on one second"" and instead just whispered between themselves on the other side of the desk for about five minutes as I stood there. Not only was it unprofessional, it was bizarre human behavior. After this unpleasant first interaction, I was prepared for a bad experience, but our server was very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful, as were the other members of the staff.The food itself is very good. The highlights of the meal included the chicken liver crostada and the chicken cooked between two bricks. We tried two pastas, both of which were well-portioned and very rich. The crudo sampler was fun; you get only a small bite of each type, which leaves you wanting more (perhaps the point?). The least enjoyed dish was the grilled nectarines, but it was still interesting. The overall decor of the restaurant is modern and clean. Dinner and drinks came out to about $70-80/ person. The food was better than most other comparable Boston restaurants. If the front desk could get better training, this could be a five star joint.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"Review for drinks+bar service only! Had a couple lovely drinks here as part of the rose menu. Boy it's Cool and Truth you Can't Hide. The former more herbal and complex (genever+cocchi), the latter a balanced fruitiness (grapefruit) with a strong smoke (mezcal) that slowly dissolves as the ice melts in the drink (though it'd be nice if it were served in a more traditional highball glass).Pretty spot, and very friendly service!",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"Great atmosphereVery friendly and polite staffDelicious foooood!!

I have also had the prosciutto di Parma app and the wrapped dates both were tasty. My only reason for deducting a star is the portion size for the price.

Made a reservation for 7:30pm, but we ended up getting there at like 6pm. We waited for about 20 minutes for a table, but in the meantime had the pleasure of sipping on some drinks at the bar!

I'm a big crudo person, so I was having a tough choice on which one to choose from their list! But we ended up going with the langoustine because of the bartender's suggestion. The combination was amazing~ the order came with four pieces, and I wanted more, but I had 2 because fair is fair :( -Paccheri with Lobster, Green Onion, & TomatoAbsolute fave! When I took a bite, I just kept saying omg omg omg. It was just so flavorful! Cleaned the plate, and dipped the extra bread in the sauce. YUM~-Spaghetti with Scallion, Crab, & JalapeÃ±oBecause the paccheri was so flavorful, I feel like this plate was a little bit more average. Maybe I'm just biased towards the paccheri~ it was still good! Just not as good as the paccheri. Wonderful staff!

We then followed it with the ramp and ricotta crostini and the peperonata and stratiaccella crostini (peppers and burrata-esque cheese), which were both incredibly delicious.For mains, my favorite was definitely the Arctic Char (similar to salmon)! The Mezzana Spritz cocktail was so good, I ordered two of these. For desserts, we got the olive oil pound cake, Earl Grey tart, and, my favorite of these, the affogato. I will definitely be coming back here again!",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"I'd be lying if I said I had, in recent memory, a better fried chicken sandwich than the Monday-only Chicken ParMezzana, a massive breast of exquisitely browned bird topped with quality mozz, red gravy and a fry that made my tongue sing a constant chorus of the 80's classic ""I Had The Time Of My Life"" paired like peas and carrots with a Rising Tide Pisces Gose.And I don't like to lie. So I'm going to just leave it at that, and give an easy and emphatic five stars to Bar Mezzana....Holy shit, I want that sandwich again right now. Okay, I'm done....(If you're still reading, are you a sandwich courier? Are you free next Monday?)",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,Ate hear for a business night out and was impressed by the food. Chicken entree was especially good and we enjoyed the octopus appetizer as well. We also tried the crudo rating which was a bit inconsistent and I was not a fan of the Panna cotta. Overall though definitely a fun place for dinner with high quality food and an intriguing menu.,Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"When a restaurant is opened by former chefs/alumni of Barbara Lynch establishments (translation: pretty big deal in Boston), you know you're in for a special treat. I finally tried Bar Mezzana for weeknight dinner recently (thanks sis-in-law for the birthday invite!), and it definitely met my expectations and carb cravings.Yes, you should absolutely order something from each menu section.1. CRUDO: both the salmon and yellowtail were vibrant, fresh, and delicate. Crudo is a must-try since it's the specialty here.2. ANTIPASTI: loved the duck egg ravioli (not plural, al-dente, and very rich in taste) and the baked octopus - just wished they were served at warmer temps.3. PRIMI (pasta): 5 choices. Highly recommend the crab tagliolini in lemon chili sauce and the lobster paccheri. Generous portions and meat-to-pasta ratio. Shellfish was fresh and sauce flavor was on point.4. SECONDI (protein): 3 choices. If you must go carb-free... recommend trying the chicken (cooked under a brick) or the hanger steak - both were moist and flavorful.5. DESSERT: I'm obsessed with earl grey, and the earl grey dark chocolate bergamot tart was fragrant and a nice finish to our meal. Only one issue, the portion size: HALF a tart... um, did the chef or server eat the other HALF?The interior design deserves some praise too: open-layout and intimate at the same time, with elegant coastal decor. Service was friendly and welcoming from all staff, but it was going at turtle speed that evening (restaurant was half-empty btw). I guess weeknights moved at a much slower pace? The other diners appeared to be regulars who liked to linger, but not us.Price was reasonable for its South End location, about $60pp (after drinks, tax, gratuity, and kitchen charge). I'd return again for another full-on dinner, or for drinks & small bites.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"They put us in a nice room for our group and set up the tables perfectly for us to interact with each other. Â It was great. Â Felt like we had a private room all to ourselves. Â They have a wide selection of crudos.Japanese Madai with Gold Uni tasted weird. Chocolate Mousse with Mint Gelato is perfect for a person that loves heavy dark chocolate. Â The Mint Gelato is different from normal mint chocolate ice cream. Â It really tastes like mint leaves.Friend enjoyed eating the Crab Spaghetti. Â It has a spicy kick to it. Lobster Paccheri and Prime Hanger Steak were ok. Â Friend liked the Razor Clams and Affrogato. Â Pork Belly and Chicken Under the Brick were good.Salmon Crudo and Yellowtail Crudo were yummy. Â Striped Bass Crudo was delicious. Â It was in a light spicy sauce.SPANISH OCTOPUS was phenomenal. Â It was so tender on the inside, lightly crisp on the outside, and favorful. Wished we order more of it. SALMON TARTARE was tasty. Â It had rice puffs on it that added a good crunch to it. We ordered it again because we loved it so much.Toasted Almond Panna Cotta with Greek Yogurt Sorbetto was outstanding.

We came here for a late brunch on Sunday and were seated immediately. There are plenty of indoor and outdoor seating options here. I definitely recommend sitting outside if it's nice out. For appetizers, there is a wonderful selection of crudo. We tried the American Snapper, which was delicious. It had a nice ceviche taste to it, but wasn't overly tangy. For entrees, the pork belly & potato hash was very good. This is a mix of small pieces of pork belly, potatoes, jalapenos, and rapini topped with two fried eggs. I wish there was slightly more pork belly (I think there were maybe only 4-5 pieces). We also tried the egg sandwich which is egg, cheese, and bacon on an English muffin. Overall, great choice for brunch in the South End. I will definitely be coming back to try their dinner menu.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"Definitely one of my favorite places in the boston/cambridge area for pasta. I've been here 4x and never disappoints, starting from the delicious bread served at the start of the meal. Then on to the crostinis. We got the smoked whitefish and the eggplant, both of which are super flavorful and unique. We also had the chef's tasting crudo, which I was personally not as impressed with, but good if you're looking for a lighter appetizer to balance out the pasta. For the pasta, I got the paccheri, which is one of their classics. Absolutely delicious! Pasta cooked to perfection, and ideal balance of pasta and flavor. If you like slightly lighter, less tomato-y red sauce, this is the way to go! I could not stop despite all the carbs consumed prior to the main course. I've also tried the orrechiete and some of the seasonals, all of which were awesome.

The orecchiette and fettuccine was a bit too salty, and the mozzarella was very dry. but lovely service and very good food!",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"Came on a weekday night and the restaurant was half full. Did sit at the bar with friendly service there. Overall place was trendy and a good atmosphere to relax and talk. 1. Dahlia cocktail - Interesting drink but very satisfied in the end.

It's not for everyone but does mix all the ingredients well with spice and alcohol.Overall, I'll come back for more drinks (which are average priced for Boston) and to try their food.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"Modern, fun, lively and great food. Whether you're on a date or a fun group dinner, this place is great, both inside and outside seating.

Then fusilli lunghi, while a simple dish, everything in it was yummy, the past, sauce, and portion was great for sharing, another winner. Felt like I was in Italy.Then the chicken under a brick, was juicy, great sides and again great for sharing, it was quite large.We finished off with a cream di ricotta, another great dish, fresh fruit, home made ricotta, not too sweet.

Our water was always full and we were seated quickly even coming in a bit late. The food was delicious! I loved the bacon and roasted corn flatbread.

First of all the menu online was completely different, so I didn't get to try some of the dishes I had heard about (like burrata), and there were little things like the boring salad I ordered coming with the dressing on it instead of on the side, but mainly there were very few vegetarian options for me. My husband said the crab cake was good and he liked the pork with candied bacon and hazelnuts, but I did not like the mezze flatbread. It was somehow bland despite all the ingredients like artichoke and tomato, and it was confusing to me that they used black olives instead of kalamata olives. It was also way too oily.

The restaurant is located inside a hotel, and it's a decently spacious area. It's nice because while waiting for members of our party to arrive, we sat and chatted on the couches in the lobby. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with wooden tables and lots of sunlight. I had made a reservation, and when we arrived they actually seated us in the private dining room! It was incredibly fancy & upscale treatment. The servers were very kind, and they even put on music in the private room for us. We ordered a bottle of champagne and a pitcher of orange juice to make our own mimosas. When the bill came, the orange juices were actually charged as individual orange juices, which was a bit strange and ended up being pricey. The lobster benedict was AMAZING. I don't even care that it's ~$23 dollars, I would go again and order the same thing in a heartbeat. I don't think I can ever eat another benedict the same. Most of my friends ordered the same, and nobody was disappointed with their lobster!I wouldn't necessarily recommend an omelet from Outlook - there's a place for everything, and I feel like a good omelet only comes from a homey diner, and this is more of an upscale restaurant! Personally I like when the toppings are all infused inside the egg itself for the omelet, but in this case the toppings were more of a filling. But if that's your style, go for it!",Outlook Kitchen And Bar,"70 Sleeper St Envoy Hotel Boston, MA 02211"3,"The entree menu looked boring and we ordered some interesting apps, and the proportions are amazingly small with $15 each, the taste does not match the price, and the duck app has 50% pure fat in it.",Outlook Kitchen And Bar,"70 Sleeper St Envoy Hotel Boston, MA 02211"2,"I came here because the pictures on yelp looked good. I didn't read much for the reviews and we were in a hurry to eat so we decided we'd just go. Our first impression was that it definitely looked beautiful inside and out but the music was extremely loud for the type of restaurant it was. We got two cocktails of their specialties menu. I got the Pain Killer, and my husband got the Old Cuban. He liked his but unfortunately mine didn't taste like anything it said was in it. The pineapple and orange juice and coconut flavor that was suppose to be infused with my rum was nonexistent. It tastes like I was sipping on watered down rum. It was especially disappointing since my drink was $15. Now the food turned out better than our cocktails thankfully. I stuck to Mac and Cheese for simplicity. My husband got the Bavette Steak Frites. I don't think they were worth the amount they cost though. In conclusion, food is good but a tad overpriced, drinks are overpriced and not particularly great - I had cheaper drinks elsewhere since my stay here started. Waitstaff and hostesses - our waiter was friendly but seemed kind of inattentive to us at times. When we were ready to pay and leave he made eye contact with us several times and didn't stop by or would turn around to help another table.

The patio is open, yet intimate. Service is attentive. Our drinks were well-priced and exactly what we wanted. We didn't have dinner, so perhaps that's more impressive, but the snacks we ordered left something to be desired. The hush puppies were stellar, but the flatbreads were so-so.

I had expected it to be a little thicker. My friend and I had both ordered bolognese and both were disappointed. The sauce could've been thicker. In defense of the restaurant, the place was quiet busy which might've correlated to the lack of richness in food. I would definitely give them another chance and try different foods on the menu.

You need to go down the stairs to the restaurant, to a red and dark dining area. Yet, they have pretty good food. At least from what we had. I ordered the burger with blue cheese. For $10, that's a pretty great deal, especially since it came with a side of fries. Of course, it wasn't the best burger I've ever eaten but for the quality I got at the price I paid, I can't really complain. My boyfriend had the Dave's Chicken Sandwich (fried chicken with bacon, American cheese, lettuce and tomato with fries and a side of spicy mayo). He really enjoyed it, and so did I, from the few bites I stole. The chicken was perfectly fried. The spicy mayo was just completed it.On the other hand, cocktails are very meh. They cost more than an entree and don't taste very good. I had the Green Tito (Tito Vodka, ice green tea, ginger syrup, lemon juice). It tasted pretty sugary and didn't seem like there was a whole lot of vodka in there. My boyfriend had the Joey Joe Joe Jr. Shabadoo (Old Overholt Rye, bitters, ginger beer, lemon peel). Everything about this sounded good to us - we love rye, and ginger beer, but it just tasted so wrong. It was undrinkably sweet, and I think they might have added too much bitters as well. I would recommend just coming for the food and skipping the drinks.

When we came in one cold winter night we figured that decor can be deceiving and maybe this was a hidden cocktail gem, but we didn't find that to be true. In between the bartender getting shots for his friends, he made two terrible drinks. The first was a Bulleit Rye Manhattan that was not mixed correctly, followed up by the El Diablo, which according to their website has ""Blanco Tequila, cassis, ginger beer, and lime juice"", which sounds like a tasty spin on a traditional moscow mule, but was way too sweet (probably used some type of ginger syrup over quality ginger beer) and had zero spice, which is odd for a drink called The Devil.

It was pretty full with families at 2pm on a Saturday. Ordered two drafts which were pretty spendy for non-craft brews, a crock of Mac & Cheese and a grilled cheese & Tomato soup combo. The Mac and cheese was awesome- -exactly what you dream of when thinking of Mac & cheese.

The steak mac n' cheese arrived to be piping hot, with the portion decent and the steak was acceptable. The medium steak was fine but not the star of the dish by far. The breadcrumb topping of the mac was crispy and golden brown. The mac inside was creamy and smooth. I dislike a clumpy mac n' cheese that usually reveal a dearth of cheese. The mixed greens gives you a psychological relief that there might be something healthy about this offering. However, the salad was fresh and dressed lightly.Service was efficient and my server was friendly. Prices here are very good for the neighborhood it is in.

Tabasco couldn't even save this dry & cold $12 burrito.I've tried to like this place and it's just a no-go at this point.",Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"5,"Great food, great drinks, great bartenders and great service! This is my favorite place in southie, the vibes are always good and I always have the best time! I recommend local to everyone",Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"1,"The service at Local 149 feels resentful of our presence as customers rather than grateful for our patronage when there are many competitors in the neighborhood. We tend to sit at the bar, and I don't need staff to go above and beyond. But when someone in our party couldn't eat the old, cold fish tacos you served, and you won't hear his feedback about the quality of the food, I wonder why you work in customer service at all. And when your server shoves a plate of food in front of us so that the sauce spills all over the bar, then rushes away without noticing, I wonder why that person is so neglectful of the customer experience. Then when the bartender returns to clear our plates, and she rolls her eyes as if we made a mess that creates a big problem for her to clean up, it's hard to imagine how she gets by in a job that is 100% customer facing. Between the poor food quality and entitled service across the board, I realize the problems must come from the leadership and trickle down to affect every aspect of the experience at Local149. Until I hear that it's under new management I will not return.",Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"4,"I really enjoyed this place. Any place with a good burger is a winner to me. This place has typical bar food but with a twist. And they have a great list of drinks and beers. The place is a bit small and will get crowded but still enjoyable. I tried the flight, they let you choose 4 beers off a list and they'll make a flight. Which is great so you can try any 4 beers you want. The flight comes with a bowl of bar snacks, it was pretzels that night. I tried the burger there, good size, tasted great and wasn't expensive. We also tried the fried pickles, the dip that came with them had a bit of kick which was great for the pickles! And you can choose what fries you want to come with your burger, obviously I chose waffle fries. Service was a little slow, we kept having to look for our waitress. Pricing was fair, I think I paid 20-30 bucks for food and drinks. Definitely coming back, I heard they have brunch.",Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"4,I didn't want to like this place.

We went to local 149 which was her neighborhood restaurant. It was a cute restaurant but it is always packed. We went for dinner the first time and for brunch the next day. The bartender which I forget his name was so nice. He was really helpful and recommend some drinks and offered to change them to out taste. We stopped into early for dinner so they only had the lunch menu out. It wasn't a big lunch menu and there is nothing that caught my eye so I just got a couple appetizers. The Buffalo chicken fingers and the mac & cheese balls were so good. For brunch the next day I got a breakfast burrito which was so good! The hashbrowns that it came with were a little spicy but they were so good. My girlfriend got chipped beef for breakfast and that was really good too! I would definitely recommend getting brunch here!,Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"5,"I posted a REALLY bad review previously, but this place is 10000% better since they fired that jerk bartender Adam!

Â I'm not a fan of the tuna sandwich though.,Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"4,"I was surprised to see that Local 149 only had 3.5 stars. I have been here twice and both times the food, drink and atmosphere have been great. I went here on a Friday night and used the ""NoWait"" app so I wouldn't have to wait at the restaurant for table. The place was packed, but timing the app right allowed us to sit down right away.They offer a great selection of beer on tap and the cheeseburger was cook perfectly. The only downside was the slow service (seemed to be understaffed), but this is expected on a Friday night.",Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"5,"First things first, if you are a breakfast person who wants the basics (and loves diners), this isn't the place for you. Take a read at the menu and you'll see what I mean. As I said to my friend, it felt like I was back in NYC.I don't live in Southie but was visiting locals who do. We went for brunch on a Sunday. One item of confusion (they should fix) - online says they open at 10 am but the door says 11 am. Great beer list with a large variety of drafts, cans and bottles with many being local. Breakfast alcoholic drinks were good with ""exclusive"" just meaning specific named liquor. I would order my Bloody Mary there again without question. We started with the mac fritters. This is something I would never order. I LOVED them. There were three in the serving and they were huge (perfect for our table of 3). The mac and cheese inside was made with shells as the pasta. I loved the sriracha dipping sauce. Â Glad my friend pushed them.The chicken and waffle recommendation came from the other friend and after a week of poor eating on the road, decided to carry on the trend until my road trip was done. Now I was raised with a Mom who loves fried chicken and could rattle off her favorite local fried chicken places faster than her children's birthdays. The chicken and waffles was a full half chicken - breast, thigh, wing and drumstick. Batter was great. Crispy. Nothing fancy about it. Just done exactly as I like it. Chicken cooked perfectly. Side of hot sauce. The waffle, oh the poor waffle, I only had room to taste a bite of. I did get to check the maple butter (YUM!) with it. I had to pack half the (half) chicken and nearly a full waffle to go. Sadly they didn't include the syrup or butter in the take-away container. Portions sizes are LARGE. Each of us ate at most, half our meals. The short rib burrito looked good and came with an entire plate of perfectly seasoned and roasted red skin potatoes. The lobster macmuffin is definitely unique (not a fan favorite at my table) but when home fries swapped for tots, is like three full servings of tots!All in all, I'm a huge fan of the food. The quality. The taste, and the portions. PS: On the way from Boston back to DC I stopped in NY to visit the Mom. I gave her the chicken as a welcome gift and asked for feedback. She agreed it was Very GOOD. Mom approved!!!",Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"1,I came here with 1 other person and when we got sat we were not provided menus or waters or any kind of service for at least 15 minutes and when we did we had to ask to order a drink. We got attitude from the waitress who accused us of sitting ourselves without the hostess. A different waiter took our drink order we got bloody Mary's and they were absolutely horrible. They were basically All water and hot sauce. I got the deviled eggs for an app and they were so salty I only had one. We got the bill and left after that to go to a different restaurant that's how bad it was overall.,Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"3,"Food was good, I had the chicken and waffle. Â That plate filled me up surprisingly, the buffalo, butter honey and maple dip things were a delight.BUTFish taco was soggy along with a burger my friend had, and the waffle that was served with the chicken and waffle was also soggy.

The food was great! Great service great atmosphere!",Local 149,"149 P St Boston, MA 02127"5,"El PelÃ_n is by far my favorite Mexican in Boston, the perfect remedy for when a craving for enchiladas en salsa verde hits. No trip to the Fenway area is complete for me without a visit to El PelÃ_n. Like other spots on this little strip, there are several picnic tables out front as well as some seating inside. You order at the counter and get your food in to-go containers, so it's also leftover ready, if you can't finish what you order (which is somewhat the case for me when I go alone and order the plantains). The staff is super friendly and efficient, even when crowds roll in, so I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes for my order. But the thing that really sets El PelÃ_n apart from other Mexican places around town is the quality of the food! The enchiladas verdes are truly superb, and their take on serving fried plantains salted and with fire roasted Salsa is tasty and creative, though I'll admit I often eat the plantains plain because I just love fried plantains. Do note that the menu is a la carte, so if you want rice or beans with your enchiladas, be sure to order the sides! The prices are so reasonable that you may understand this just from looking at the menu. I think the prices have gone up a bit from when I first visited in 2015, but I haven't noticed because it's still such a good deal!",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"4,"Came here on a Monday night to order take out to bring back to my hotel. While the outdoor seating was packed, there was no wait inside, and I ordered a tamale and cheese enchilladas to go.My food was ready in about 5 minutes, and though I had only about a 10 minute walk back to my hotel, the bag was nearly soaking through with grease; fortunately it didn't create a mess anywhere.The tamale was tasty if slightly dry, though certainly above average. The enchilladas were flavorful and large, though they feel like they had a bit too much cheese.All in all, the food tasted fresh, flavorful, and was priced right. I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in town and want a quick, authentic meal.UPDATE: My previous review lamented the lack of veg options (I saw only chicken/beef/pork tacos) though in a further review of the menu, I see they do have a number of offerings (veg burritos, quesadillas, plantains, and more) that caused me to change my review.",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"5,"I usually come here whenever I feel homesick, tbh El Pelon brings me home for at least a few mins!

Â Great spot in a cool neighborhood.,El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"4,"I've been wanting to come to El Pelon and I finally came here a few days ago. It's a little hole in the wall since there are so many new restaurants and cafes opening up in the Fenway area. But it's so worth the walk because it's literally just a block away from Boylston and all the other fun stuff. It's a really small place, which only seats 10-15 people max. They offer quite a lot of Mexican foods such as tortas, quesadillas, tacos, and burritos. I've been wanting to find a place in Boston where I can get my fix on Mexican food and I think this place is the one! Being from LA, I have pretty high standards. The quality of the food, the taste, and the price. Nothing will ever beat $1 tacos from the taco truck in LA though, so it kinda sucks how places here like El Pelon sell them for $3 each.Anyways, I just ordered a carne asada to go and it was delicious! For $9.10, you pretty get your money's worth. It took me over 45 minutes to finish this, but I'm a pretty slow eater. I loved the tortilla because it's nice and soft, and most importantly, holds everything that's inside. I love how this burrito didn't fall apart on me while I ate it. The steak was nicely seasoned, tender, and juicy. The salsa was not watery and leak everywhere, which I really appreciate since it didn't make eating a mess. The rice was cooked perfectly, because I've experienced places where they give out hard rice. I took out the cheese and left the beans because I'm trying to implement beans into my diet. Overall, I want to come back and try more things, but it's a great place to grab burritos with friends!",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"4,Their el guapo burrito without the steak is soo good.

I ordered an El Guapo burrito from here which consisted of grilled steak, mexican rice, black beans, fried plantains, jack cheese, fire roasted salsa, lettuce, and crema. The burrito was around $9.50 for a pretty hefty portion. I really enjoyed the plantains in the burrito which provided a sweetness in contrast to the salty burrito. I couldn't taste the salsa in the burrito, and I would've liked a little more spice in it.Other than that, it was a solid burrito. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you're in the area, it's a good option.",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"5,"It's a short walk from Fenway station and is located between a few other food shops.

Horchata is worth a try as well!",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"4,"Generously sized tacos with lots of flavor!I ordered the Caramelos tacos and was a fan of how juicy the steak was. You're gonna get large, flavorful chunks of steak that are beautifully coated with ooey gooey melted cheese. Plus generously topped with guacamole! Overall, the two tacos in the order may sound like very little, but they are a decent size and have the potential to fill you up.

Got the fish tacos, fish burrito and horchata. The fish tacos were definitely my favorite! Super flavorful. The fish burrito was really good too, much more filling than the tacos so I would recommend this is you're really hungry. The food was so fresh and came out piping hot! The horchata was really tasty and refreshing too! I definitely would come back if I'm in the area and craving Mexican food.",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"3,"There was so much hype surrounding this place that my friends and I eventually decided to check it out. The restaurant itself is small inside but there is plenty of outdoor seating and the time between ordering my food and receiving it was pretty short.I ordered the ""El Guapo"" since that seemed to be the item that everyone recommends and raves over, even my anatomy professor. However, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The steak was cooked well and had decent flavor and the fried plantains were a unique addition to the burrito that helped distinguish the taste from other places some but overall the burrito, again, was meh. Maybe it was because mine seemed like it wasn't fresh or because the lettuce they added was an odd topping but it definitely wasn't an amazing location that lived up to the hype. I might try this place again as I haven't found a great Mexican restaurant in Boston yet but for now I wont go out of my way to come back.",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"2,"Those who have intolerances & allergies should watch out! This is great food. However, it's just not consistent and they are not accommodating. I always ask for no salsa because of a food intolerance, and about half of the time I have to unwrap my burrito and take salsa out. I just have an intolerance to some of their foods too - I would be wary if you have an allergy, even if you make it very clear to them. There was also the time I saw someone pull an industrial staple out of their mouth from eating a burrito, but that was years ago. It's really too bad because when they get it right, they really get it right.

It needs to be more than just putting the basic ingredients into a tortilla. Each element was there but they were all lacking flavor. Black beans didn't taste simmered and seasoned. It didn't look like Mexican rice (white, not reddish) and it was mushy. Tomatoes in the pico were mushy. Meat wasn't seasoned enough (tasted like just s+p.)",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"4,The only reason I give 4 stars is because this place doesn't have queso (why?!) & the chips weren't good at all.

For my entree, the hoisin glazed salmon, served over a bed of pad Thai noodles, crisp veggies and crushed peanuts was delish. The salmon was cooked to request, and flaked perfectly over the noodles. Would've preferred just a little bit of spice though.Our table shared a handful of desserts, including a tasty key lime pie tart.

Decent selection of beer and wine. Fewer seafood options on the menu than I'd expected.I got Linguini with a Trio of Clams. Good portion of pasta and clams. The clams were excellently seasoned and cooked. The pasta was well prepared. The garlic and white wine sauce was OK (perhaps I'm spoiled from having lived in Italy for 3 years).

Great. We had lemongrass shrimp soup (I am not too sure of the name) as appetizer, grilled lobster and linguini with trio clams. Starting with lemongrass shrimp soup, it was okay. Nothing I've tasted before - the taste was very unique but I wasn't too sure if I liked it. My partner enjoyed it though. Grilled lobster - we bot absolutely loved it. Amazing. I recommend this dish for anyone who likes lobster. Linguini with trio clams - the seasoning was on point. For this, however, I am pretty biased because I just enjoy garlic seasoning. I personally didn't like the texture of the pasta but this is subjective. If you like clams, it is worth trying. - Service On point. Nothing much to say. I enjoyed my experience here. - InteriorThe lighting was little too dark in my opinion. It was difficult to see the other person's face or even the dishes. Other than that, the interior is very well designed. The restrooms are all private, which I appreciate. - PriceThis is the reason why it is a three star not four. While everything was good/great, it was over-priced. I don't mind paying more for better food/service, but I didn't think the price charged was reasonable for the quality of the food. The food was good but not the best I've had; on the other hand, the price was exceptionally charged, which I'm somewhat salty about. I would have enjoyed it more if the price was 80% of the current price. - OverallIt is a good restaurant that can be great.

Â You won't go home hungry or broke, you just won't remember having gone there in a few weeks.Room: Â I don't remember much about the room--it was a little dark and set a good mood for the evening--it was just really unremarkable. Â The bar area was very nice though. Â And they had a great selection of spirits and cocktails.Service: The service was what you'd expect of most chains, where the servers do their duty but nobody stands out and nobody shows much personality. Â I'm not against chains, they just don't usually turn out great things, either from the kitchen or the service. (Note: it's not impossible to be a great chain--see Capital Grille. Â They nail it every time.)Food: I've been there twice and the first time around I had a grilled Arctic char that was really terrific. Â The second time I had sole, which was good, and perfectly cooked, but nothing to write home about. Â The Â bang bang cauliflower was over processed and sweet, like Americanized Chinese sweet and sour veggies. Â The chowder was very good and the oysters were very good. Â Overall, I think the food is good, and sometimes very good. Â Value: Â Given the quality of the fish, I think the value overall is good. Â The ingredients seemed good--there just wasn't anything that really stood out consistently and it reminded me of what you'd get it you crossed a good fish house with Chili's.

The shrimp cocktail is 5.50 per shrimp, but it is overcooked and it feels like plastic. Â The oysters are served with too much water in them. The lobster mashed potatoes have no taste. Their salt shakers have no salt in them, which tells you a lot about how much flavor is in their food.

I also got the chocolate mouuse from their late night menu and it was rich and pretty good. Overall, I'll come back to try their seafood probably only as a one time thing unless it blows me away.",Legal Crossing,"558 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"I'd solicited plenty of restaurant suggestions for my Boston trip, and ended up underwhelmed at all of them. So when it came to finding a spot in the North End, I opted to check out reviews on Yelp and see if any took reservations, since the places where we waited in lines didn't live up to the hype. Turns out, hardly any restaurants let you reserve tables, but Rigoletto does!We walked in a couple of minutes prior to our reservation, but they already had a table ready for us with my name on a little chalkboard at the table. It was such a cute touch! Our waiter Matthew greeted us, and he might be one of my favorite people in Boston. He was sweet and funny, and we just adored him!After perusing the menu, we ordered drinks and the burrata appetizer to start. I do like burrata but find it to be pretty pricey for the small size I usually see in Italian restaurants. So I was happily surprised to see not one but two balls of the cheese on the plate, along with delicious garlic crostinis and a balsamic reduction. Needless to say, we quickly devoured it.For my meal, I ordered the ricotta gnocchi with their vodka sauce. It normally comes in a gorganzola sauce but Matthew said it was no problem at all to swap the sauces. My dish was DIVINE. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked and pillowy, and the sauce was just delicious. Sonya opted for one of their specials which had lots of seafood, and she was in heaven. We both were so full by the end, but that's because it would've been a sin to leave any of our wonderful meals on the plate.The lesson to be learned here: do not let the lack of a long line deter you. This place is wonderful and I'm SO glad we chose it. Absolutely the best meal of our trip!",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"2,"I feel bad writing this but our experience last night was just ..meh.The service was excellent, the oysters delicious, and the scampi was cooked perfectly. But everything seemed to lack a little flavor. Even the bread! What North End restaurant serves you bland, tasteless bread?!? The seafood was fresh, the pasta al dente, and the broth yummy (though they put way too much in the bowls). Â But you wouldn't want to sop it up with that bread. They didn't offer us soup spoons, either. Now, to be perfectly fair, it could have been a bad night. There was a party of four couples who could not have been louder. We had to move to a different table but there was no getting away from them. They were oblivious to how much they were ruining the night for other patrons and the poor staff. All they cared about was finishing their wine and seeing who could be the loudest at the table. Definitely left a bad taste in our mouths. We should have known that, reservation or not, there is a reason that on a street where every restaurant seemed to have a line to get in, they did not.",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"3,"I love pasta and wanted to try Rigoletto's homemade tagliatelle, but on this visit I opted instead for their Piadina Flatbread $17. Â The Piccola Italia with its goat cheese, balsamic cipollini onions, double smoked bacon, arugula, and fig reduction just sounded great! Â I did wonder a tad about the portion size, however, since on the Rigoletto website their flatbreads were listed between the appetizers and the salads.When I arrived for my early dinner, they had a spot set up for me as per my reservation. Â Water was provided and the food did not take long to arrive.Anyone who's been to Blaze with me will know that I like some pizza with my salad, but still I was surprised at the generous mound of arugula which entirely covered my flatbread. Â Beneath the green, the perhaps 11 inches in diameter circle had been sliced into nine relatively quadrilateral pieces. Â The crust was thin and ranged from crisp to floppy. Â The smoky bacon was the overwhelming flavor profile, and I noted that the sweetness of the onions and the fig was too light in comparison.A cold breeze hit my neck from behind where I sat at their bar. Â But still I made do and threw on an extra layer as I continued to munch, till I lifted my water glass off the maroon napkin coaster only to notice that the water I had been sipping throughout the meal had a cherry stem nestled by the bottom of the glass. Â I gagged as I pointed it out to the bartender, who immediately whisked it away and brought me a fresh glass.I quickly rinsed out my mouth, and found my appetite diminished.Generally, I find it unfair for someone to complain online if you hadn't given the business a chance to respond first in real time. Â So, I asked the hostess if I might be able to speak with the manager of my experience.He arrived as the bartender explained to me that the cherry stem had likely dropped into the glass as she was handling the fruit, after she noticed that I was no longer eating. Â So she told him that she had already provided me with a fresh glass of water. Â He seemed completely satisfied with the situation. Â I was not certain that her explanation was the actual case, however, as when I scanned the bar area from my seat I could not see how the glasses might have been stored in such a way as to allow such a relatively hygienic scenario, so I was still feeling a bit disgusted and disturbed. Â I also remembered a past experience when I had been sipping water directly from the glass at another establishment only to later realize that there was lipstick along the lip of the glass - I don't wear lipstick.When they realized I wasn't quite as satisfied as they were, I was asked what they could do to make things right. Â I said that I only wanted them to do what they would do normally in such a scenario - I was not going to ask for anything. Â I felt that my feelings had been disregarded and I basically just wanted to be taken more seriously and sincerely.Well, in short, nothing happened. Â On my part, I read for a few minutes to get my mind off my disgust and onto something (anything) else, in hopes of getting some of my appetite back. Â I managed to finish my dinner, requesting a take-out box for the remaining two pieces. Â The bartender refilled my emptied glass, and offered a large paper bag for my leftovers, since they had mis-ordered and so didn't have any of the smaller bags. Â And off I went into the night.",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"We were starving and wanted a place to sit. We lucked upon this restaurant and boy were we pleasantly surprised!You get a lovely basket of fresh crisp bread with a yummy spread when you arrive. There is a full bar with many items to choose from. We ordered the red sangria. It packs a huge punch! We ordered an appetizer with fresh ricotta cheese, red pepper and honey on crunch slices of bread. Omg heaven! I could have just had that for dinner alone.Hubby ordered the Parmesan special, which was chicken and eggplant and cheese all stacked and cooked together. I ordered an amazing pasta dish with HUGE shrimp on top. They were the best cooked shrimp I have ever had. I was so full from the appetizer that I ate the shrimp off the top and saved all the pasta to take home. The hubby took half his to go as well.Great service, cozy place to eat and have a drink.

The best we've had in a long time .The service was friendly and fast.The place was very comfortable too.Will definitely again !!,Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"3,"Yea. No. I would never eat here again. I chose the place as a commensurate optimist would. Our appetizer, eggplant parmesan, was outstanding. Too bad it was cold. Not even lukewarm. But that just speaks to how amazing it would have been... My sister said the soup was one of the best she's ever had. Think it was lentil. Â My seafood pasta was just ok. Missing the wine or garlic or both. The bad part was we were the first to arrive, followed by a party of 6. After we ordered wine and appetizers, a party of 2 cake in and she said they couldn't be served because they were short-staffed and the chef couldn't hand more orders. Hmmm. I've worked in restaurants where we've served tables of 20 short staffed. Not even, wait 10 min and I'll check. Just nope. No food for you. We asked if everything was ok and she said fine but it just went downhill from there as she closed the restaurant. They served our food and I'm hoping the bus boy was the fill in chef because no way that was worth $60 for lunch when my sis ate a bowl of soup and no wine. Next day, still closed. Wish she'd have been truthful and allowed us the opportunity to not be served and eat there when things were in top shape. Oh well. North end has plenty of options. Rigoletto...stole the optimism right out of me.",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Were searching for a good Italian dish before leaving Boston. All the normal places were full so when we came across Rigoletto there were some empty tables which usually is a red flag for me. But we ventured in and were not disappointed. Not you typical Italian menu but some good surprises. The Pork with cherry peppers, spinach and potatoes was great. Kids were able off the menu chicken parm which was good.

We ordered a bottle of chardonnay as well as the red sangria, which was extremely refreshing. The waitress was friendly and attentive, although it did take a long time for the food to come out. I ordered the cavatappi bolognese - it was well cooked pasta, but lacked flavor.

Many of them are only open during dinner time. Atmosphere:Cute little place with open windows so you can sit people watching if you were by the window. There's a bar in the middle and seating around the place. See pics. Food:No complimentary bread for lunch (don't know about dinner). I was mostly disappointed by the calamari which set the tone for the rest of my meal, unfortunately. The calamari was really really BAD. I don't think I have had any worse calamari before. It was leathery, dry and unchewable. I almost spit out many of the ones I ate. I think I swallowed them just because it was like $12..... Maybe it was just a bad batch but... it was really really really bad.The other pastas were good though - The Chicken Parm had a tender piece of chicken and good pasta. The gnocchi was flavorful and creamy. Staff:Very friendly staff. He was funny and helpful. Didn't really check in on us or maybe I would've reported how bad the calamari was.... Overall, the pastas were good. I would just not go back because of the calamari.",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"This place is so cute friendly and delicious!

We started out with the fried dough, prosciutto, and cheese appetizer which was out of this world amazing! I don't think i have had anything like this before and would come back just for this. The house bread was yummy served with a dip that had the consistency of hummus, with a strong garlic flavor. Mmmmm :) Â For dinner we were looking for something simple, and they were so accommodating and flexible. We got gnocchi with marinara and chicken.

Yes please!My friend and I were walking through the North End and were hungry for Italian. And of course most of the restaurants in the area had lines out the door with extremely long wait times. So happy we stumbled upon Rigoletto Ristorante because it had no wait.This cute little Italian restaurant has a great wine selection, pretty good service, and really delicious food. My Capesante tasted amazing. The scallops were fresh and the fried polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The mushrooms and spinach I thought had too much garlic and salt but still pretty good.

I had originally tried to make several other restaurants but they earliest time they had was 9pm. I came across this one on OpenTable with reservations at 7:30. Â I checked out their pics on Yelp and studied their menu prior to arriving. My husband and I arrived on time and we were seated immediately. Â We happen to be there the last weekend of February and they had amazing 60 degree weather and had an awesome seat near the window that made for a great ambiance. Our server greeted us and then went to go look for menus while taking all eternity to find them. Â  I use to work in hospitality so I can spot a new server a mile away. Â At the same time I am understanding of it because we have all been new before. Â But putting a new server on during a Friday night not be the best option. Â We ordered 2 glasses of wine and then it seemed like it took forever for her to check back on us to take our order. Â When she came back to the table I ordered. Â For dinner I decided on Tagliatelle Scampi that had scallops, shrimp, PEI (Prince Edward Island) mussels, tomatoes, and a white wine lemon sauce. Â My husband had the Cavatappi Alla Bolognese with veal, pork, pancetta, and a light tomato cream sauce. Â Please see pics and prepare to drool. Â Everything was amazing! Â I have been dreaming of it since we left Boston for that weekend trip.They have a full bar as well in which they have specialty cocktail drinks. Â They also have a superb wine list as well that will compliment any one of their entrees.One thing I will say is the rest of the staff noticed that the new server was needing help and stepped right in to assist. Â The rest of the waitstaff really made our experience enjoyable. Â Overall my husband and I enjoyed ourselves will def visit this space when we come back to visit. Â The manager that night told me they have only been open for about a year and half. Â So they are the new kid on the block in the North End.",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"3,"Stopped in late Saturday afternoon after the bruins game for an earlier dinner. Â The entire place was empty as it was rather early, however, it did start to fill up the longer we stayed. Â I have mixed feelings about this place, hence the 3 star review.The pros-the bartender was very nice and attentive-the mussel appetizer was amazing The cons-the $$ sign is deceiving-bread was served cold in the middle-chicken dish and side of spinach was overly salty If you do come I highly recommend the mussels as it was the highlight of the dinner.

Thank you!",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"I've come to Pho Basil on many different occasions and have ordered multiple things in their menu. And every time, it's been delicious. While they have really awesome lunch specials, I tend to come here at night. They typically always have a 25-40 minute wait in the evenings, whether it be a Tuesday or a Saturday. Yet, they seem to do things so efficiently, and if anything, it's a part of the experience.In terms of dishes, I really enjoy their pad thai, drunken noodles, their mango and pineapple fried rice, and pho, though I've had friends order other things and have been extremely satisfied with their food. I'd say my go-to is drunken noodles with crispy chicken. Their drunken noodles seem to have a great texture in the noodle, the best tasting sauce with the perfect amount of spice, and the best selection of veggies, which I think they change up accordingly to the season (which I might be wrong.) Their crispy chicken has the perfect crispy outside, which they pan-fry, and the perfect flavor on the inside. It's hard to describe, but it's good; you should try for yourself.With food at a great value and great wait staff, Pho Basil is that Thai / Vietnamese experience you'll love.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"3,Delicious broth for pho with Beef but the meat was super fatty.

I also had the chicken wings and avocado smoothie which were very good as well.,Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"5,"I think a place deserves 5 stars if I'm flying in from a different city and go out of my way to revisit. I came here specifically for the Kao Soi!Kao Soi here is delicious in my opinion. It contains crispy egg noodles and crispy chicken encased with a nice rich and flavorful curry broth! My second time here, my second time ordering that dish, my first time writing a review for this place.I do have to say that the parking is kind of a nightmare but not too too bad at non-rush hour times. You can park on the street or if you turn on Haviland street there's a parking garage that you can park at without having to drive around in circles trying to find a parking spot. Both times I've been lucky to find street parking so that must mean that people come and go quite often on the street.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"5,"Skip the Pad Thai and the Drunken Noodles - dishes you can find at any Thai restaurant and go for the super authentic Khao Soi! It is a curry noodle dish that I have rarely been able to find outside of Thailand. The soup was so rich and delicious. The crispy noodles added such a delightful crunch. The actual noodle itself was an egg noodle sitting under the soup along with a breaded chicken thigh. Paid $11 in total for one of the best, most homey dishes I've had in Boston. What a steal! P.S. don't mistaken the pieces of ginger for bamboo shoots!",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"4,"To Go Review:Friendly assistance when placing our order, with the employee calling back to confirm preferences.

We both happily consumed the Veggie Triangle Appetizers, they were tastily stuffed with Potato, Carrot, Green Pea, Onion & little Curry Powder.

The meals still have similar flavors, but they seem somehow less rich and flavorful. The curries also seem to have less actual curry. The meat is less tender and moist. In particular, the duck is now fried/breaded, but not juicy and tender, and tge chicken is almost dry. We've been here several times in the past year and, sadly, each time had left us feeling just slightly disappointed. Still good, but not quite great anymore, at least to us. What happened?",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"5,"This restaurant had so many great qualities - casual environment, a full menu, great prices, delicious food. I got the Vietnamese fried rice lunch special and there was so much food, I definitely could've shared with another person. Other people at my table also got lunch specials or noodle bowls. I can't speak to the pho, but the tom yun soup tasted more like Korean kimchi stew, but I'm not complaining about that at all. I think pho basil is a wonderful spot to grab a fast, casual lunch whether it's by yourself, with coworkers, or friends. For the amount of food you get for the price you pay, it's one of the biggest bangs for your buck I've seen in terms of Asian cuisine in the Boston area.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"5,Lunch specials for a $7.95! Completely caught my eye walking by to want to come here for really excellent Thai food. I ordered the part I and my daughter ordered the masama curry.

We're talkin family-style servings so if you have a great appetite and you're on a budget this is the place you want to be!Location draws a lot of Berklee college students nearby and anybody who is going to watch a show at Symphony Hall.

We came around 9pm on a Monday and the restaurant was nearly full. Big selection of Vietnamese and Thai food with a menu that spans several pages. Service was attentive and gladly gave us chili oil in addition to the sriracha and hoisin. My pho broth was excellent with plenty of noodles and meat. Similarly the Thai style fried rice was huge and perfect with the chili oil sauce. It was definitely enough for leftovers and will be our meal today. Definitely give this place a shot.,Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"3,Was expecting better quality of food based off of previous reviews. My chicken was rubbery and very bland. The soda was flat. The service was nothing to write home about.,Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"4,"So you want some Pho? You want some fresh veggies? Quick service? A more than adequate portion of protein? Actually tender and edible protein? I have found your Pho restaurant in the Back Bay Area of Boston... These are all of my upsides but I will also add that the place was turn tables around quickly and folks were filling the seat just as quickly... They were serving very Vietnamese dishes and hot and fast... I only waited for my Pho like 10min, if even that long... Now the down side... only one size bowl on the Pho so come hungry or you are leaving food on the table... The veggies were fresh and crunchy but mostly bean sprouts, some cilantro and lime wedges... so if you missing some jalapeÃ±o or anything else you may have to ask... I normally only rate a restaurant after I have been there at ;east twice but as this was a business trip and it was delicious, I had to post...

The pho dac biet (10$) did not have the problem of stuck together noodles that I experienced last time. It was pretty great -- noodles were a good texture and the soup was very flavorful. The papaya salad (8$) was also super tasty. Just the right amount of spicy and all around tasty. I didn't enjoy the vermicelli with pork and shrimp (9$) at all though. I don't think it was bad, just not to my particular texture/flavor preferences.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"2,"Not quite my favorite.

I typically stay away from mixed restaurants since normally they aren't very good... but every food item I've ordered from here has been delicious. Thai and Vietnamese are two of my favorite Asian cuisines too so having both in one restaurant is a plus!Pros: Servers super friendly, relatively big portions considering the price, all da food -- you can't go wrong with what your order. The pho, tom yum, drunken noodles, duck, curry, pad sew, spring rolls, etc all hit the spot! Cons: No reservations, always a wait (since it's so damn good), and not much parking in the area.

The service is good, and the kitchen will make your food without fish/oyster/shrimp sauce if you request it. As a vegetarian, that is important to me. I always eat too much of the savory food, and am usually unable to down any dessert. Maybe next time I will try some and update this review.Don't think - go right to Pho Basil..

Despite going during an extremely busy time the service was quick, friendly, and consistent throughout the night. The food was incredible- I got the Tom Kha soup and Thai fried rice both with tofu.

Â After spending the morning at the Boston Fine Arts Museum my wife and I wanted to grab a bite to eat before heading to the airport. Â We yelped up Pho Basil as it was between there and our hotel. Â We found a line of people in front of us which was a good sign but blew were worried about time. Â They told us 10-15 minutes and even though we were not confident of being able to get in that quick they sat us right on schedule. Â We quickly ordered drinks and I ordered the pineapple chicken lunch special and made it a combo for $2 more. Â My wife wanted the spring rolls and then ordered ginger pork lunch special and also upgraded to the combo. Â The combo is well worth it as you get a nice cup of miso like soup, a dumpling and a small fried vegetable roll and salad before your entree arrives. Â All of these were tasty and a nice starter. Â We then received our entrees both of which had fresh vegetables and were very flavorful. Â My pineapple chicken was supposedly to be one star spicy but I did not think it was spicy but very good but not overly sweet, it was accompanied with a nice portion of brown rice (you could have white as an option). Â My wife's ginger pork was recommended and meet or exceeded expectations with a delicious sauce accompanied it. Â Yeah they forgot the spring rolls but apologized and acted quickly to see if we were willing to wait for them or cancel the order. Â They were good but not awesome. Â Food - 4.5 Fresh and well prepared bursting with flavor. Â Loved the addition of lunch comb. Spring rolls could be better.Atmosphere 3.5 . Â Nice a cut above a strip mall / small store front.Service - 3.5 Seated us with in their estimated time range when we were doubtful. Fairly attentive, missed the spring roll order but made it right. Price 4 Good value especially at lunch time.OA 4 - I would definitely come back.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"5,"Tldr version:My favorite pho place in the area. Beats some unnamed places in Allston, and Quincy (much to my fiance's chagrin). Get the pho satay, its a bit spicy, full of noodles and beef and guaranteed to fix your cold right up if you're sick!Long version:Food: Is amazing! Be forewarned, I have only gotten pho here so I have no idea how the fried rice and other food options they have here are. Drinks: Hot tea (not free), milk tea and my favorite, smoothies. I usually opt for the pineapple and it tastes legit.Service: It does feel a bit rushed at times when you're seated but I can't blame them. It's a very small place and the line usually ends up going outside during dinner time and it is rough standing out there waiting for people to finish eating their hot soup so I'm sure the staff try and move things along (it also helps their bottom line too).Decor: small space. Never feels too cramped though. Nothing fancy going on in here.I've tried several pho places in and around the city and this is hands down my favorite. Beware with parking. Not easy around here especially during school year.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"4,"The appetizers were a bit too salty for my taste. Got a medium rare steak which was yummy, though a bit too crispy on top. Our waitress was very polite and attentive. A contrast to the hosts/hostesses who looked like bored high schoolers. Upon hearing it was our anniversary, we received many congratulations and a slice of chocolate cake for dessert. A nice surprise :) A rather pricey restaurant, but would recommend for a night out or special occasion! (Especially if you aren't the one paying, date night!)",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"2,"I am a teacher, a husband, and a father and once a year I treat myself to a steak dinner. Â I chose Abe & Louie's because I had eaten there before and the food and the service were great. Â However, on my special night, neither were true. Â It's sad actually, because I sent this sincere e-mail of concern to their restaurant and received no response, yet here on this site, I see responses from the restaurant, so maybe they'll read this one.Though I made reservations in advance, I was given a table near the bar, which is not the same experience as being in the full dining room, but that's not what ruined the evening. Â After being seated, I was not waited on for a really long time, and I had to flag down one of the waiters to ask who my waiter was, and no one seemed to know. Â Turns out, I had no one, so they began to take my order. Â What usually was an experience of one knowledgeable, friendly waiter telling you the specials and checking in on you, was now 3 different waiters, some less experienced, tag-teaming my table.But that's not what ruined the evening. Â The worst part was when I got my steak - the entire reason I was there - and it was undercooked. Â I asked for medium, and it was practically blood red and tough on the inside. Â I only get to do this once a year, and because it was already so late, I suffered through it. Â I know I could have sent it back, but I didn't have the time. Â I will have to wait another year to get a night like this, but I probably won't choose Abe & Louie's after this experience, which is a shame. Â I really did like it in the past. Â I just can't risk another year.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"3,"mostly mediocre food, but perfect serviceI did not need a reservation. The host staff and my waiter did an incredible job! My waiter went out of his way to provide suggestions and be friendly, with all kinds of seasoned helpful touches, who made it a pleasure to dine here for that aspect of my experience here!I was crestfallen and startled with the sub-par quality of my 8-oz filet mignon. Not tender, fresh-like, and buttery at all, which is how this cut of beef usually comes out. I didn't want it to go to waste, as I was kinda tired and hangry, so I finished it, anyway, being the food ho I am. The bread was just ok. Â The cookie dessert with ice-cream topping was underwhelming and tasted like they went to a bargain grocery store and put it together. In sharp contrast was the 1/2 order of pureed crucifer: a mouth-watering, perfectly seasoned, somewhat fine-to-mid-coarse-consistency cauliflower! Get that! I drank water. My total bill came to about $68 before tip.The interior was quite bustling and had a fun vibe. Sitting outside on the patio allowed me to people-watch all the foot traffic, and enjoy the summertime.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"For our first stop in Boston, we found Abe & Louie's. The service was excellent and the prices were fair for being a steakhouse. Since it was lunch time, we opted for burgers and we were not disappointed. I tried the ""Sesame Ahi Tuna Burger"" and it was very good. It was cooked exactly how I requested it and it was accompanied by fries and a nice salad. My wife had the ""Abe's Prime Cheeseburger"" and she was happy with her selection. It was cooked medium-well with fresh tomatoes and lettuce with a side of sweet potatoes fries. Lastly, the vegan option on the menu for my sister-in-law was a salad and the cauliflower steak. She was full and satisfied with her selection. However, although all was great, the best part of the meal was the server. Â He gave us plenty of time to decide on our entree's and he was very attentive. All our requests were taken care of in a timely manner. What was really helpful was that after lunch was done, he took the time to give us ideas and must see spots in the Boston area to visit including other restaurant recommendations.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,This review is only based on a dessert and espresso although I've been here many times for dinner it was either pre Yelp or amnesia Yelp but you can't go wrong eating here that's for sure.  Â  Â I was in town with my wife we were just doing some shopping n waking around on Newbury st and Prudential Mall it was a nice day and we hadn't had many to that point so we wanted to take advantage. We were originally supposed to meet a friend here for dinner but I've known him forever and I know he's always late so we ended up at Eataly and when he finally responded we were finishing up dinner and met him here for dessert. I got the cheesecake and a double espresso and yes amnesia Yelp struck again and I forgot to take any pictures but trust me the espresso was nice and strong with a frothy head and the cheesecake well that didn't stand a chance it was delicious nice graham cracker crust I easily could've eaten a couple more thankfully I didn't. I never even thought of going here for a dessert but I guess it's not a bad spot it was really good. I think I'd rather eat there then have it though,Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"I really like Abe & Louie's... I've been here a few times for brunch only and it's always been consistent. I love the cinnamon sugar bread they give you. It is warm and soft and melts in your mouth... and the cinnamon sugar the pile on top is the perfect complement to the bread. I usually get the filet club or the lobster club. The filet club is very unique... and not something you usually see on a menu. Steak on bread, what could be bad about that? The bread is soft but not soggy and the steak is nicely cooked to the temperature you request. The sweet potato fries that come with it are also perfectly balanced in texture and taste. The lobster club is good, it's nothing special but the lobster is fresh and they don't overly use mayo. They have a really second floor that gives you great views of boylston street! I highly recommend coming here for brunch.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Abe and Louie's is located in the heart of boston on Boylston Street. We went there yesterday night to celebrate our 15th anniversary. The host was very polite and welcoming and guided us to a table in the back. We had the choice to sit out as well - nice option here! Our server was Matt and he took care of us during our dinner. We were given some fresh home baked bread that literally just melted in our mouths. We ordered a Caesar salad to share, which they served us separately in our own individual plates. This was followed by our main course. Scallops and shrimp risotto for the mrs and blacked salmon with a side of mashed potatoes with garlic in hot oil on the side. Everything was delicious. It did take a while for the main course to arrive and Matt apologized for the delay. But given that the place was busy, and the food was excellent we thought it was worth the wait. I ended up putting the garlic and lemon on the salmon and it felt like a party in my mouth. All in all a wonderful experience.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"I went there this past Saturday 3/17 for my birthday. I ordered the Abe & Louie's French toast. Presentation and taste wise, it had that factor. I liked how they placed the pecans and maple banana separately because I'm not a huge fan of having nuts in my food. The French toast was nice, fluffy, soft, and sweet but not too sweet. I ordered the butterscotch bread pudding; it was so delicious! I don't know if they changed the plating, however, my dessert came out in a flat plate and was square shaped. Nonetheless, I really really enjoyed it. As far as service goes, my server was polite but he didn't come and check on us as often as I would've liked, I noticed he did check on his other tables more often than mine (we were only a party of 2). He also didn't introduce himself so I'm not sure what his name was.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"This is a lovely spot for brunch. We made reservations for a Sunday morning, and were seated right away. The complimentary bread is delicious and kept warm with a warm plate!!! It's so soft and comes with a sugary coating. The portions are regularly sized - not too big or small. I got the crabcake eggs Benedict which was delicious! It didn't taste like there was lots of crabcake but it was decent. It comes with potatoes, which are pretty good - nothing out of the ordinary. Their eggs Benedict 3 way comes with steak, crabcake and lobster. The lobster is delicious!!The service was excellent, food came out pretty quickly and we got refills on our drinks frequently. Our glasses were never empty. It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating, but I would recommend making a reservation during peak hours because the place filled up quickly for brunch.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"Top notch experience, from the food to the service to the ambience. I dined on the grass-fed filet mignon with the chimichuri and for sides we did asparagus, the harissa carrots, and garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was FANTASTIC as were the sides. For dessert we had a butterscotch cobbler and the skillet cookie. SO YUM! Overall we had a fab meal with excellent service. Will definitely be going back.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"Food is excellent! Great service. Good vibes. If you haven't had steak from here, you MUST go! Seafood Casserole & drinks are amazing too!",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"I would give Abe & Louie's five stars for their steak (or any dish with steak for that matter), but since I only mooched off my partner's steak-including dish and had an average omelette (three stars) instead I'm giving four stars. I had the **Potato Bacon Omelette** ($15) for brunch, while my partner had the succulent, flavorful **Steak Eggs Benedict** ($23). My omelette was under salted and bland, both in flavor and in texture. Â I felt that the eggs were overdone. On the other hand, the Steak Eggs Benedict was DIVINE. Hands down the best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten! The hollandaise sauce was creamy and complemented the juiciness of the medium rare steak so well. And the eggs were poached perfectly. Â Such a satisfying brunch meal. Service here is impeccable, and there was a live jazz band for our Saturday morning brunch :3I will def come back for more steak goodness when my wallet is ready (lol) but I encourage you that if the two small pieces of steak on the Eggs Benedict were that eye opening, it is definitely worth the relative splurge!P.S. Their complimentary bread here is also amaze. It's pull apart bread, coated in melted butter I think. They're soft and fluffy, and come apart so beautifully in these cute orbs!",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"The bae and I made reservations at Abe & Louie's for our one-year anniversary, and we ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. Our server was helpful, attentive and so passionate about the restaurant's food; you could tell he loved his job and that we were in good hands. We first started off with two cups of their award-winning clam chowder. The server suggested dipping their oh-so-buttery bread into the chowder, and boy does that just melt in your mouth! We then ordered the tuna tartare as our appetizer. For entrees, we went ALL OUT, because why not!! It was our anniversary; and we were celebrating. The bae ordered the 24 oz Bone-In Aged Prime Ribeye. I wanted to try something different so I had the Lobster Savannah, which comes with of course, the lobster as well as mushrooms, peppers, parmesan, and sherry cream sauce. When the orders came out, both our jaws dropped; THE ENTREES WERE HUGE. Abe & Louie's does not hold back on their portions! Key lime pie is our favorite dessert, and whenever restaurants have it on the menu, we have to order it. However, we were full from the entrees so we asked for the check. BUT THE RESTAURANT AND THE SERVER DID THE SWEETEST THING. They delayed our check so Â they could tell the kitchen to bring us their chocolate cake and ice cream dessert for our anniversary. We were wondering the entire time why it was taking a while for the check, but it was because they wanted to surprise us! 11/10 for the amazing customer service. Abe & Louie's truly cares about their customers. This restaurant has wonderful food and excellent customer service. It's not one of those restaurants that charge you $50 for an entree the size of your thumb, and you leave hungry. It's definitely WORTH the price. I highly recommend this to everyone! Thanks for a memorable night!",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"3,"The service was on point, the food is not worth the cost. We only visted because of the gift certificate we had which saved us $100. The bread. Very buttery. Salty and sweet and warm. My favorite part of the dinner. My boyfriend and I ordered the porterhouse for 2 which didnt have much to it. We ordered it medium and it came out mostly well. Not much to say I think it's all in the name but today they didnt live up to it.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"This place offers the elite steakhouse experience. Â This spacious two floor restaurant is rustic and gorgeous. There is a bar on each floor with over ten seats at each bar. There are some high top tables near the bar. My buddy and I were in town for work and sat at a high top table. Were were immediately greeted by an amazing server. We were giving wine suggestions and provided with amazing buttered bread rolls. These were some of the best rolls I have ever had. I ordered the ribeye steak with fries. The food came out within 15 minutes. The steak and fries could not have been better. The steak was seasoned wonderfully and cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested. The fries were perfectly thick. I am still thinking about this meal. The wine and cocktails were also delicious. I cant wait to return to this restaurant. Pricey but worth every dollar. For steakhouses, it is as good as it gets.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Came back again to enjoy the last night of a long 1st half of my trip to Boston. Â Although it's been a long time since my last visit, the place, food and staff is exactly what I remember it being. Â Such a classy spot to enjoy friends and food. Â As usual, spot on from the appetizers to the main course. Â I won't wait as long for my next visit. Â If you decide to go because of these comments, you won't be disappointed.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"I was highly recommended by my Dr and glad that she did . My wife and I ordered the porterhouse for two which was excellent and for side dishes we had the cream of spinach and mashed potato. Both were excellent especially the spinach. For appetizers we had the fresh onion soup ( the cup and not bowl ) which was excellent as well . I will go again the next time in Boston . PS My waiter was Matthew , good service and quick .",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Definitely a treat if you're working by the convention center. It was a busy night so the four of us decide to do a dinner seated at the bar. We tasted the Lobster Mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts, tuna, cauliflower mashed, and chocolate cake. Â We covered a lot of menu! The lobster Mac and cheese was very cheesy and had some good bites of lobster. I would def try this out if you love Mac and cheese.I didn't try much of the Brussels sprouts, but they had a good bite.The tuna was seared on the outside and rare in the middle. It had lots of pepper crust on it, so be aware of that spice when you take your first bite.The mashed cauliflower blew my mind! I'm now the biggest fan. If you didn't know, you'd think it was just mashed potatoes, but really really delicious. One of my favorite dishes.And then we finished with chocolate cake... OMG, please save room for this huge slice of heaven. It's super rich with a fudge like icing. They add a scope of vanilla ice cream on the side to complete this perfection.The bartenders were friendly and I was glad we hung out with them.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"4,"After celebrating my bday dinner here, my gf and I returned to for hers. Â Using the lessons learned from our last experience, we skipped the appetizers (nothing interesting, underwhelming) and placed an order for the porterhouse. Â Definitely get an add-on for your steak (we ordered hollandaise sauce) because as good as the meat is here, the cuts are larger so it'll help keep you interested in every bite.Contrary to other reviews, we were unable to order the porterhouse cooked to two different temperatures. Â The waiter's explanation was that the 40-ounce steak is a single piece of meat, but didn't seem to comprehend the idea of separating the strip from the tenderloin and leaving one cut in the oven longer. Â Whatever, we would have only ordered rare and medium-rare anyways. Â The creamed corn and creamed spinach from our previous visit were flops, so we tried two different yellow and green sides with the mac & cheese and asparagus.We ordered the porterhouse rare and it showed up exactly as requested - land sushi. Â Ok maybe more like land sashimi, but land sushi definitely flows better. Â My gf was a little freaked out about how cool the center was and only ate a few slices of the filet. Â I found myself more interested in the strip than the filet but since my gf didn't quite pull her 95-pound weight in taking down the porterhouse, I binged my way through and left her the sides. Â The mac & cheese was a big hit with both of us, we were both surprised since we're not typically fans of baked macs - especially the breadcrumb topping. Â However this mac wasn't dried out and the cheese sauce was truly a sauce versus melted cheese goop. Â The breadcrumb topping is sparse and exists enough just to give you a slight crunch in each bite. Â The simple olive oil and salt/pepper-seasoned asparagus was a good break from all the savory flavors.Because we mentioned the birthday ahead of time in the reservation, a slice of the chocolate cake and scoop of vanilla ice cream was provided free-of-charge. Â My gf was excited all week for this desert, however did note that she thought that the slice was bigger at my birthday dinner when we forgot to mention the occasion and paid full-price for the desert.If you made it through my entire review I'll offer you a pro-tip: register your email and get a coupon for $50 off your order of $150+. Â You can always order irish coffees if you approach the end of your meal and need a few more dollars to meet the minimum =].",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"The place was closed to Newbury Street and there were plenty of people when we went there on a Friday evening. The steak was pretty good and vegie was also quite tasty. However, the best thing about this place was the decoration and the service-outstanding, really!",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"5,"Amazing Amazing.I saw an article online about this store (MIT students made a machine making bowl). We thought it was cute and decided to give a try here on our visit to Boston.Not only the experience was super cool and unique but also the bowl was HOT!!! Sizzling hot bowl for that price? Please bring it to NYC. My bf, tired of those pricey, cold bowls from his lunch in the nyc, says he misses Spyce from time to time. We had the latin bowl. Do not forget to add jalapeÃ±o from the ingredient section (if u want it). It is little bit in the bottom and easy to miss. And be aware of what the staff puts in your bowl. I specified no cilantro, and she almost put it in until I stopped her. Human makes mistakes!! LoLThe drink with some kiwi was okay but was not that good. Will not recommend it. As it seemed it did not go well with the taste of the bowl. At least the latin one.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"4,"Such a cool concept! Having a robot essentially prep, cook and serve the food- so efficient. It also means that portions are going to be the exact amount each time and the food will be cooked exactly the same way each time. Consistency. And the food itself is not bad! It's as hearty as a Chipotle burrito bowl and as unique as some Sweet Green bowls (one of the options had pomegranate in it!). The variety of options makes it a good place for a group with differing preferences!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"4,"Super fun and convenient place where a machine cooks your food! You order on a tablet when you get in and can choose among several bowls (you can customize them also). Then, the machine receives your order and you can see your food being cooked (your name shows up!). It's incredibly fun and fascinating to watch as it prepares, cooks, and plates your food. The final step is done by humans as they add your toppings and put a sticker with your name on the bowl. The personalization is a nice touch as well as you feel like you have complete control over your order. The bowls start at $7.50 (you can add extras), which is incredibly cheap among similar stores!The space is really small though, and it gets very crowded during meal time. Probably best to grab and go.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"Awesome! Food was actually good. Portion size was just right, I didn't feel overly stuffed and I left happy. The flavors were spot on especially for the indian and Mexican Â bowls. It was fun to watch the food being ""cooked"". I think it's just warming and mixing things. The cooking bowls are cleaned in between bowls (as a vegetarian this is very important to me). I can't wait to try the other flavors!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PLACE I thought this was going to be a hype-trap: you go once to see the robots, the food is subpar, and you never go back,NO.I would come here if there were no robots; they're the cool icing on the cake but the food steals the show!I walked in and an employee complimented my outfit and was super friendly.I'm liking this place...I went over to the screens and saw that the menu was divided into sections and vegan was an option. I almost cried.I selected the Moroccan bowl, customized it to be grain-free and swapped almonds with pomegranate for $1 more and then watched the robot go to work. The process ended with an employee garnishing my food for me and then it was handed to me with my own Alex C. sticker. So cute andDE-LI-CIOUSThe flavors of the Moroccan bowl work perfectly: cinnamon, coriander, cumin, and allspice with raisins and olives and kale. My gosh, this was so good and well worth the price ($7.50 plus the additional dollar for the pomegranate). I will DEFINITELY be back. I have been going to Dig Inn because it was Boston's only other vegan, healthy, customizable joint. Now Spyce is in town in the same price point with unique flavor profiles. I'm not a fan of Boston, but I'm a happy camper now.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"Great Scott!I've seen some robot based/enhanced places. Roller coaster restaurant in Europe, some robot-based bar in Vegas, and now this.I had passed it previously, thinking ""oh, just another place making bowls..."" and kept walking without even so much as a glance inside.Until today... sitting (rather standing) on the red line looking for ""Hot and new"" places in the area. Not wanting something loaded with carbs, I thought I'd go for a bowl... plus I really wanted to see what the robot thing was all about.About the robot thing: you order at a terminal. They start you off with seven bowls, but these are incredibly customizable and then wait for your name to pop up above one of the cooking stations. Don't worry, Skynet isn't coming soon, the robots only cook the hot stuff. The fresh elements are then added by a human! It's also really freaking cool!But how about the taste? Spot on. I had the Latin bowl by the way, with added egg and some crisp spicy rice (puffed rice?).You know how I'm always yammering endlessly about balance? Well, they've mastered it like a Cirque du Soleil acrobat! Proteins and veggies were all in balance, without any one ingredient overwhelming another with its sheer quantity. There was freshness, savoriness, a little oiliness from the avocado. What I liked most of all is that the fish wasn't overloaded with salt!They don't skimp on the meat either, there was an appropriate (without disrupting balance) quantity of chicken. By the way, it was tender and flavorful! Speaking of flavor, I disagree with those who claim blandness. It's not in your face, but it's not devoid of oomph in the slightest. Regarding the drinks... I was able to try the Limeade and Hibiscus Ginger. I am also really digging the fact that they come unsweetened, and you add syrup to taste. This way, you don't overload your cup with unwanted sugar.Service was fairly quick, friendly, and nice!I also have a couple suggestions for possible improvement to share. - Avocado Crema was good, but I am not sure if it can be called crema (could be dead wrong here). It is more like a highly pureed guacamole (avo., salt, lime and lemon juices)- Lack of straws... I understand they are trying to be great environmental stewards, but in a place with somewhat of an emphasis on the to-go aspect, straws and lids would be helpful. - Spiciness - They have some sriracha for adding some heat, but as a lover of heat, I would love to see more varieties of hot sauces- Syrup - All I have to say here is a slightly better dispenser, like the ones used for olive oil that give a nice steady pour. The one they have is rather unwieldy and requires shaking. (unless this is what they were going for).",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"This is probably one of the coolest spots in all of Boston. They only have two workers inside, the food is mostly made by robots. The only human interaction with the food is adding sauce and putting the lid on top of the bowl. You even place your order with machines! The food is delicious, I had the Indian and it was a great blend of sweet and spicy with neither being too overwhelming. And the best part is the price, because the food is made by machines, it's an incredible place!!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"4,"I wouldn't say that it's cooked by robot, but lunch here is definitely cooked by machine. A nicely organized machine that you program at the kiosk with your style and extras and then the machine adds it up and pours it into a hot stir bowl that slowly rotates to cook your food. When it's done, it simply turns the bowl into your to go bowl and then it cleans itself ready for the next meal. Pretty slick, really.I chose the Moroccan and added extra chicken. It didn't take long until I could see my name up in lights watching my lunch being cooked. A few minutes later, it was poured out and my name was called. Super easy and simple. Tasty and spicy, cooked exactly to the specifications I programmed.The automation here is neat to see and the system is quite organized. I'm impressed.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"This place is really cool I had to visit when I saw some other reviews raving about Spyce in the area. I wanted a quick lunch and wanted to see if the food was as good as people say. I walked to the kiosks to place my order it was very simple to use and I had no trouble making my bowl. I ordered the thai bowl with a few add ons and was only about $8 not bad! I got a seat and saw my name appear over the pot that it was going to be cooked in. It got me really excited to watch my food be prepared and wait till it was ready. It took about five minutes to be made the guy added a few toppings and called my name to pick it up. I was amazed how well the food was prepared and the bowl had a sticker with my name on it. The bowl itself was very good I did not need to add anything to it because it had plenty of flavors mixed in. For the price, quality of food and service I give this place a 5/5.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"If you're still a die hard fan of The X-Files then you will have surely seen last seasons episode where Mulder and Scully visit a restaurant run completely by robots and technology. While Spyce doesn't take it that far, it's almost there. You order via a touch screen, pay with card or cash (first human contact) then watch as your order is cooked by machines. Finishing touches are done by humans before you get your bowl. I ordered the Indian bowl and the Thai bowl. Both were packed with flavours that I can relate to. The Indian bowl could have used more spice. To be fair, the option was given to add jalapeÃ±os to the bowl however- jalapeÃ±os aren't an Indian or Thai variety of chilli.Great food, fresh tasting and of course it's quite the show watching robotics and machines making your food. I'm just waiting for them to incorporate a drone delivery service!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"This creative, state of the art, and delicious restaurant was a great pick for lunch or dinner. The environment was modern and high tech. The food was so good and just the fact that it was cooked by robots made it even better.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"4,New restaurant with a great concept. Affordable. Simple. Delicious. The food is prepared and cooked by machines and garnished by the employees. You walk in and place your order at the many kiosks Â for ordering. There isn't a lot of space or seating but it is a vibrant atmosphere.Watching the machines collect the ingredients for your order then cooked in a rotating cooking bucket before it gets dropped neatly into your bowl. One of the few places where your food actually looks as advertised!The great thing about having an automated cooking system like this is a high degrees of consistency in the quality of the food being cooked.I definitely recommend going here to try out the food and i will definitely be back to try each item on the menu,Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"I've been to Spyce twice now, once in opening day, and once a few days later.The automation concept is the obvious selling point here; Â It's really neat. Â You place your order on a computer, which is great for these bowl-type places because of the wide variety they offer... Easier to push buttons on a screen than shouting at a human in a noisy room across a food guard.You can see the little boxes whizz by on the track ferrying your ingredients, watch them dump the food into the cooking device, then watch your meal spin and cook in front of you.While your meal is cooking, it shows your name and your order on a circular screen above, which lets you track your food. Â I love this feature, but it just SCREAMS for a circular progress bar.The human interaction comes at the end, when they put some finishing touches on your bowl (creamy toppings, lemon juice, etc), then put a lid on it. Â It would be neat to see this automated in the future.The food itself seems to be a debated topic. Â I thought it tasted great, though a few of my friends considered it average. Â All I can say is that for $7.50, you're not going to get a better tasting bowl. Â Flavors are well thought out and balanced, textures are considered and executed, and there's no shortage of seasoning. Â I tried the Latin Bowl and the Moroccan bowl, and enjoyed them both.The Latin bowl has a nice touch of heat from braised chilies, mellowed out by a combination of a cool cabbage slaw, radish, and an avocado crema. Â Roasted chicken, black beans, and brown rice give the bowl a hearty, savory core. Â Onions, garlic, and some toasted spices give a nice finishing, elevated touch.The Moroccan bowl uses a ""ras el hanout""--a spice blend from North Africa--to pack a punch of flavor. Â At Spyce, this is a blend of cinnamon, coriander, cumin, and allspice. Â Mediterranean staple ingredients like chickpeas, olives, and currants are enhanced by the ras el hanout, with everything getting pulled together by the cool yogurt on the side.Love the idea of this place, and I hope other entrepreneurs build on it.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,Spyce has brought the future of fast casual dining to DTX. And it's awesome. Sure a lot of the intrigue might be the pure novelty of it and this surely isn't to say that all restaurants should be automated this way but they've done a fantastic job streamlining part of the fast casual prep process and I'm excited to see them expand. We tried both the chicken and rice and Indian bowls - both of which were delicious. Love the pomegranate on the chicken and rice bowl! Fresh ingredients and you cannot beat the $7.50 price tag per bowl in the area. By far the healthiest and best value bowls you're going to find in downtown Boston.,Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"If this is the future of convenience food, count me convinced! The ordering and cooking were both painless and quick. No chance of an employee mishearing an order, the tablets are super simple! No more wondering about how long the food will take, you can see your food as it cooks! If you want to communicate with a human, no worries, there are still some humans around to answer questions or sprinkle on your pomegranate seeds.I must say, I was a disappointed when I first saw the portion of food. For ~$10 each, and considering Spyce is saving on labor costs using the robots, I was expecting a bigger meal. However, what the meal lacks in volume, it more than makes up for in freshness and taste. I was honestly impressed with how good the ingredients were. I tried the chicken and rice (with added salmon), as well as the Indian bowl. Both were very tasty and well cooked. I slightly preferred the chicken and rice bowl, both I'm sure you'd enjoy either of them!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"4,"I had jury duty nearby and came here today for lunch with some other jurors. I heard about this place through some online articles and through some pictures a friend had taken when she came here. The concept is very interesting.Upon walking in, you're typically going to be in line for one of the 5 or 6 kiosks they have for you to order your food. There was maybe 8 people ahead of me but the line went down very quick. Â The kiosk itself is very easy and intuitive to use; not full of options that confuse you. Ordering was a breeze and then you get to watch your food being spun around in the automated wok things! They have an electronic board on top of each ""wok"" that announces the name and what dish is being made. It's definitely cool to see the little machine come by and drop your ingredients into this ""wok"" and then the ""wok"" proceed to continuously spin for a bit before dumping it into the bowl with great accuracy. The garnishes are put on/in by humans and then a sticker is slapped on your covered bowl with your name on it. People get creative with these names..I watched a dish get made for Batman.One of the jurors got a drink and was wondering where the straws were. He asked a staff member and they said they don't have straws because they're environmentally-conscious, to drink it the old-fashioned way. Pretty great, although maybe they should have a sign near where the utensils are so you're not blindly searching for a solid minute or two.As for the actual food, I got the Thai bowl and so did another juror. We both thought it was great. Filling and decently-priced for the area at about $8 with tax. Straw juror actually chose from the vegan menu, which was also very easy to find on the kiosk. He enjoyed his meal too. They also have a gluten-free menu on the kiosk so this place is really trying to appeal to the masses.If I'm ever in this area again, I'd probably stop by.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"Great concept. These guys are really trying to push the boundaries of how food is prepared and served. Came on a Friday lunch rush and the line was pretty long. However, the line just kept moving and I was able to order and get my food in roughly 10-15 min.As for the food, although it is robot prepared, tasted awesome. The sauces and the ingredients we're fresh and super tasty. I got the chicken and rice and it seemed like a lighter yet just as tasty version as the ones in NYC.Hope to see this place grow to many other places. Keep up the good work guys!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"Chef Daniel Boulud and some MIT frat boys-turned-entrepreneurs have come together to create a restaurant which is both nerdy and delicious. Plus healthy and affordable. And easy to get to and fast and fun. All the wins!I was lucky to get invited to get a free taste of Spyce before their official opening. After an easy 3-minute walk from Government Center, I found myself in a line waiting to order on a row of kiosks. There are 7 bowl options which all sound well thought out and tasty. Once it's my turn at the kiosk, I choose the Thai bowl, which has roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bok choi in a Massaman curry sauce. I opted to switch out the brown rice for freekeh and could have added on other items to customize it like an egg or avocado crema. I decided to stick to the original recipe to really get a taste for the bowl they're going for. After submitting my order, I stood with the rest of those waiting, watching the robots work their magic. Much of it is behind the scenes, but patrons can see robots moving horizontally, dropping ingredients into the different drums and then the drums spinning, cooking everything up. A staff member then picks up the bowl and adds the finishing touches, along with a lid and a sticker with your name on it. Once your name is called, you pick up your treasure and are free to add Sriracha and Cholula hot sauces at the side table. You can also fill your drink cup with iced tea, limeade, or hibiscus ginger tea.I sat myself down at a table and lifted the lid, immediately smelling the delicious spices in the curry. Digging in, the chicken and sweet potato mixed beautifully with the other ingredients and the flavors were intense yet well-balanced. It tasted much better than I had expected, honestly. I had to keep reminding myself that robots had done this! I doubt I could have made it better with my own hands. And it would have taken me much longer too.Each bowl is $7.50 (add-ons can be more) and you can have food-in-hand in under 15 minutes. It's a great place even without the robots. But c'mon, the robots make it that much cooler.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"3,"I liked the concept, how efficient everything is and the interior. Food has a lot of flavor: note the name Spyce, but also too salty to my taste. Price is very reasonable. I like how their beverages are all unsweetened. Not a lot of options to choose from. The moroccan bowl I got had mostly grains and very little cooked down greens.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"3,"Tldr 3.4/5- food wasn't bad, tastes like something I can make at home- herbs, greens, and fruit were fresh- portion could've been larger for the price paid. Needed more chicken and carbs (look at my review for noon. You can see how much chicken is in the bowl)- extras like the herbs, greens, and fruits are an additional cost and you would think they'd add more- no option via kiosk to order extra chicken or grains - verdict: try it once . Ear here again if you can afford toLocation: downtown crossingService: you order from a kiosk, so there's little human interaction aside from the people helping near by. Â I can see why people would like this concept- get your order fast and some people have anxiety in social interactions. I can dig it.Food: I got an Indian bowl with chicken, freekeh (middle eastern grain that has more chew than rice), kale, pomegranate, herb salad, and yogurt.Food cooking process- I'm not sure how it works, but after you place your order you see it going into this drum or tumbler thing. And then after a 2-4 mins it's done.I think most of the ingredients are cooked in the back and maybe thrown into the machine to heat up? Not sure. They didn't really explain how it worked.Tastewise- it's good. Kind of like a fried rice with curry seasoning/powder with chicken strewn throughout. Â The curry flavor tastes like madras curry which you can find at your local market. Â The bowl was seasoned properly as well, just the right amount of salt, although for my personal preference I would've liked it to be have more heat. Â Additionally there were curried potatoes in the freekah mix. This was cool.herbs, kale, and the apple tasted fresh. Â I like the herb salad- which consisted of cilantro and mint- because it added a vibrant flavor to the bowl. Â This part reminded me of Vietnamese food which I grew up eating. The kale wasn't cooked down all the way to mush and had nice crunch, still had the dark green hue too. The apples were a nice touch as well because they added tartness and a crunch factor.I can't really comment on the pomegranate seeds since they weren't included in my bowl. Would've been nice though. Maybe they ran out? Â :/Portion size- hmmmm this is where I deduct a star or 2.Base bowl comes with your choice of rice or freekah with chicken and yogurt.The other items- herb salad, apples, kale, and pomegranate- all cost Â extra. Even with all the extras I wasn't full after eating it. Â  and there wasn't a way to add extra grains via the kiosk either. Not much chicken in the bowl as well.Then again I got this for free.Price- $11.24 for. Everything. Â Bowl alone was $7.50. Â Pomegranate was $1. Apples, herb salad, kale were $0.70 each.Sales tax was $0.64.Verdict- it's not bad. Â Flavors were good to me, but it seems like it's something I can make at home and the prep wouldn't be so hard. Â The portion wasn't that big for something that costs $11.24. For this price I can go a couple of doors down to Noon and get a bowl with extra chicken and all their selections of toppings. This bowl always fills me up. Or I can go farther down to Chipotle and grab a steak, chicken, tofu bowl with extra chicken, and or guac.I think for the price the base bowl should come with kale and the herb salad otherwise you get a plain grain and chicken bowl with just yogurt. I got this bowl free of charge so I can't complain. Just thought I'd give my honest opinion on it.3.4/5",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"5,"Came here with relatives who were staying at the Westin and it was the closest we'll rated place--then when we got there, realized friends had just raved about it.We got there early, around 5:30, so no wait.

The service has deteriorated... what happened to management? The host was everything less than helpful. I greeted her with a smile because I was excited to eat here. They have great food! But she had no smile, didn't even speak to me and walked us over to our table, tossing the menus down. The waitress was okay, definitely not the service I experienced before. Missed a drink, didn't bring us water for a long time.. just small courteous things.(P/S this was on a Sunday night.. not that busy).The worst part was that we were sent flat over fried churros, and on my friends birthday.

The little devil drink is to die for- perfectly sweet and spicy. All the tacos are delish but small in portions so you can try them all!! Can't go wrong here. I would eat here every night if I could",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"A few colleagues and I came here for dinner during a work conference. I hadn't really spent any time in this part of South Boston before, and from our Lyft ride to the restaurant, was not expecting to see tons of people. But I was super glad we had a reservation because there was a line out the door, with people rolling in every few minutes. This place was POPPIN' like Orville Redenbacher! I felt like every yuppie that side of Boston had found their way to Loco with ten of their yuppie best friends--which is fine because I was able to blend right in. It took 10-15 minutes to get our reserved table, but they were legitimately about to overflow with people, so this was not a problem. We found the servers and all the staff to be very friendly. The lady who served out table in particular was good about recommending drinks. Given the huge crowd around the bar, it was loud, and I mean LOUD inside...my ears were actually ringing for an hour after I left. But again, this is clearly a suuuuper popular place on an otherwise relatively dead block. Now for the menu: We enjoyed the guac and salsa trip. The chips have a consistency half between a pita chip and tortilla chip, which was interesting. I liked that the salsas were either different, and the grilled zucchini & habanero one had a nice kick to it. They have a fun margarita menu with creative names like The Britney (watermelon/mint margarita) and the Little Devil (jalapeÃ±o tequila). The El Jefe (aka classic) Margarita was OK, but tasted just a smidgen watered down.The buffalo chicken tacos were buffalo chicken tacos, although nothing to go crazy about. They use fresh toppings. We enjoyed the carne asada tacos, which were reminiscent of of carne asada in Texas/Oklahoma (that's a ogod thing). Big ups to Loco for being really attentive to my seafood allergy; they proactively filled me in on the stuff I couldn't eat, which was fantastic service. Much appreciated! Overall, this was a super fun restaurant. Just be sure to make a reservation!!",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"A great place for a casual brunch with friends. The restaurant is spacious and hip with a chill vibe. Be sure to make a reservation though or be prepared to wait.My friend and I split oysters, and they were very fresh.

It's definitely somewhere you want to visit with your friends especially if you're planning on going out afterwards.There was a wait for a table, but we had no issue with it considering the bar was super lively and inviting. The margaritas were very good. For food we got oysters, shrimp cocktail, veggie quesadilla, and carne asada, fish, and shrimp tacos. The carne asada was SO good.

Went on Sat. during brunch hours and despite not having a reservation we were seated pretty quickly. The hostesses and our waitress were all very nice. I really liked their brunch menu because it was very diverse. For drinks I went with a mimosa and my friends had the coconut margaritas - both were great and strong! For food we started with the chicharron guacamole and we were blown away. SO. MUCH. FLAVOR! I could've easily ate a whole order by myself. Even the tortillas, which were dusted with paprika (I think), were delicious. For the entree I decided to go with three of the tacos and most of my friends went with the carnitas omelette. The tacos were all priced between $5-$7, a little pricey but worth it because they're very hearty and full with toppings. My favorite was the shrimp, followed by the Baja Fish, and lastly the Chipotle Lime Chicken. Loved the open/rustic decor and the lively atmosphere, its the perfect setting to eat out in the summer.Lucky for whoever lives in Boston they have $2 tacos during taco Tuesdays and my friend was telling us they're delicious.

After spending some time (and having a few drinks) here, I can see why! The vibe in the place is great- a lot of good energy and was a big crowd for a Wednesday night. I tried the coco margarita which was really tasty but the El Jefe margarita was on point. We started with the Crab Guacamole- interesting combo! It was delicious- I would highly recommend. I did the Grilled Shrimp and Baja Fish tacos as my entree- both really good. I wanted to try so many more! We had put our name in for a table but ended up sitting and staying at the bar. Great experience.",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"5,"Really enjoyed our experience here - came on a Sunday afternoon for a snack and a drink. We ordered drinks at the bar because we weren't able to be seated until every single person was there. Somewhat annoying, but also understandable considering how crowded it ended up getting. The bar service was a little slow, but it was EXTREMELY busy. Pricing was reasonable and the drink sizes were fair, although our second round had a few drinks that were like 80% ice which was annoying because they're definitely not cheap.Once we finally sat down we were seated in a booth. This worked out for our group because we were able to make room when two additional people showed up which might not have otherwise been possible since it was really crowded. The booths also had much better lighting than the tables which, on such a crowded day, might have gotten annoying. From what we could tell the tables were lower to the ground but still had people walking by, which can lead to a lot of chair bumping and getting your head knocked with purses etc. So definitely try to get a booth when it's busy! The food itself came out really quickly - we got an order of the crab guacamole which we loved! Really good sized portion and extremely reasonable price. It came with a ton of crab and definitely enough guac. We then ordered the queso dip, which was also awesome. This portion was a bit smaller, but relatively to the price was fair. I definitely wouldn't have minded a bit more. We also really liked it, but it did taste a bit like fake cheese - might have just been the consistency, but if you're picky about cheeses, I wouldn't go with this! However, our group totally didn't mind so we enjoyed it. Kathleen was our waitress and she was awesome. Supper attentive and handled the big crowds really well. She didn't make us feel like we needed to leave even though we were definitely lingering a bit. We will be back!",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"5,Very good. Great vibe. Young crowd. Great to watch by tourists. Food was tasty. Crab guacamole had plenty of crab and savory. Shrimp taco and carne asada taco had plenty of ingredients in the taco. Margarita and Paloma were very good and cold Corona.,Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"I went to Loco Taqueria for a team dinner based off a suggestion. This restaurant is definitely a must try. In regards to the environment, the restaurant has mood lighting and plays music very loudly - would not suggest if you're trying to talk to your date too much. Otherwise, I was totally into the entire design of the restaurant. The cocktails and margaritas were delicious and super strong! I tried the Britney and the Michael Bivins. The Michael Bivins drink was actually a look to sweet for me. The Britney was definitely a drink I would get again. The food has a lot of flavor. We started with the trio salsas and guacamole appetizers. The salsas were nothing special but the chips and guacamole were really good. We all got tacos and everyone was happy with theirs. I got the carne asada tacos and they were really yummy! I definitely want to go back to try the other cocktails and tacos on the menu!",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"TACO TUESDAY @ LOCO: Their tacos that usually cost $5-6 a piece, they were cut down to $2-$3.50 a taco (think 50% off). Â Keep in mind that other people are also aware of this amazing deal, so this place will be packed and noisy. Â We ""vultured"" two spots at the bar after hearing there was a 45 minute wait, and even so there were plenty of people without seats at all, just standing around the bar with their cocktails.Food highlights: *Grilled Street Corn* appetizer, *Baja Fried Fish Taco*, and the *Cola Pork Carnitas Taco.* Â We also tried the Chicken Tinga, Grilled Avocado, and Fried Pork -- would not recommend these.*Grilled Street Corn* is juicy, charred, and sweet, drizzled in a garlic and chili mojo sauce that vaguely reminded me of chipotle mayo but better. Â SO GOOD. Â So sad there were only three (aka I'm too broke to buy more of these.)The *Fish Taco* and *Carnitas Taco* have an excellent ratio of textures and flavors: crunch and juicy; umami and tangy. Â After being very underwhelmed by our first taco (aka the dried mess they call the Pork Taco), the fish taco stood as PERFECTION in contrast -- it's been a while since I've had such a delicate, yet satisfying crunch. Â The carnitas taco was deeply satisfying in flavor; they drew out the umami of the meat and brightened it with sweetness (pineapple salsa), and crunch (mini tortilla chips).IN SUM: I'm pretty satisfied! Â Yes, they are busy, cramped, extremely noisy, and their service exists only in its bare bones (I've heard they're pretty packed on non-promo days too).

Celebrated my husband's birthday this year and thoroughly enjoyed the drinks, music, food and good service. We were given a corner table by the window so that we can accommodate more friends who were gonna join us later for drinks. We stayed until closing hours. We tried a couple of new stuff this time around - the jalapeÃ±o drink - goes well with the guacamole and chips BTW. The watermelon Margarita was an instant hit as well. So was coco. I tried their crispy Cauliflower dish- a tad bit bland but I liked it because I like Cauliflower in general and don't mind less spice for a change ..I can see however, that many people may not enjoy this dish very much because of its slightly bland nature.",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"5,The food and margaritas at Loco are to die for!

The staff is also awesome, super friendly and attentive!",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"3,"I suspect the kitchen ran out of onions that night... and other mistakes were made. While I feel this place has great potential, these blunders made the experience less than stellar. I started with the Bartender's favorite tequila flight. I was elated to find these came in Glencairn glasses. I am a lover of fine spirits, and these are terrific for nosing and siping. I liked the combination of a Blanco, reposado, and aÃ±ejo tequila, as it allowed for a comparison between the flavors of tequilas aged for different amounts of time. I am typically a whiskey drinker... and I believe good whiskey is whiskey you like to drink; with the same applying to tequila. However, I encourage you to drink it neat; sip it, savor it, enjoy it, but don't shoot it.Then there is a tuna crudo tostada. I loved the combination of textures, there was soft, crunchy, as well as fresh from veggie elements. In terms of flavor, there was way too much lime juice. It was as if someone heavy-handedly squeezed out a lime, twice, or even thrice. Raw tuna has a very mild flavor, and while sauces and dressings can enhance the flavor, in this case, the tuna and everything else was overwhelmed with lime.The Carne Asada tacos were, unfortunately, a miss for me. The steak was overcooked by about 15-30 seconds, but in that time lost some juiciness and tenderness. Also, it was cold, being only a hair and a half above room temperature. A little more seasoning on the meat also wouldn't have hurt either. Still, flavors were good, but the texture is this dishes weak point. The tacos desperately needed something with a little freshness and crunch, such as onions! In terms of portion size, the tacos were piled on with stuff and stayed together surprisingly well, but tortillas themselves were a smaller than I was expecting. Also, be careful of the red peppers, especially if you don't like, or aren't used to a little heat.Still not sated, I gave into temptation and ordered some chips and guacamole. The chips were spectacular, some of the best homemade tortillas I have had. Their thickness was on point, and seasoning level was perfect. Another Yelper mentioned they use a different seasoning depending on what you get. Well, I got a combination of regular salt, something a little sweet, and one or two that were vinegary. All delicious, so I'm not going to give them grief for the three kinds of seasoning, especially since variety is the spice of life. The guacamole was very good also, the only change I would have made is to add some onions! Even that's not it! For my final dish of the day I ordered some duck taquitos. These were the real MVP. Here all the flavors and textures were on point. I loved the crunch of the shell and the softness of the filling. There was also a spectacular play of sweetness and saltiness from the sauces and just the right amount of heat from the filling. The service was a little slow to come up at first, but good cake out fairly quickly after my order was placed. The location is clean! Finally, I recommend coming early to avoid the crowds.",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"5,"This place was BOMB. My boyfriend and I needed some post drinking fuel and thought Mexican food sounded like a great idea. We unexpectedly stumbled upon this gem and were NOT disappointed. The vibe is very hip, bustling, and has the perfect ambiance for Sunday funday. We were seated immediately even though the entire place was packed which was a huge plus. We ordered beers and the chips and guac to start. Was very impressed with the chips because they were well fried and coated with this incredible chipotle lime dust. The portion of guacamole was also generous and was some of the best I've tasted in a while. We also got tacos: grilled shrimp, carne asada, and chipotle lime chicken.

I had a chicken Caesar salad and it was exactly what I was in the mood for. It came out just as hoped for and I ate the whole thing. My dad had a burger and it was cooked just as he wanted/had asked for. Though we didn't get adventurous with our food orders at all, we got exactly what we wanted and left Porters feeling sated and ready to wrap up our evening. Though I wouldn't go out of my way to return to Porters, our experience was pleasant.

In particular, there are lots of of burgers and sandwiches to choose from. They're all reasonably sized, fairly tasty, and inexpensive. For me, the steakhouse burger hit the mark - HDL cholesterol levels be damned - as it featured a huge half-pound patty topped with bacon, blue cheese, onions, lettuce, and tomato. You can pile on more toppings if you'd like. Moreover, an onion ring or sweet potato fry substitution is quite cheap at only 75 cents extra.A solid go-to especially if you have other favorites in the area that are unbearably crowded.",Porters Bar & Grill,"173 Portland St Boston, MA 02114"4,"We were staying next door at the onyx hotel , and decided to pop over and try this place recommended by the front desk staff.

I always leave full- the dishes are quite large. If you come for lunch the portions are smaller but priced great (pastas ~$10). My favorite thing here is the pasta bascaoila, which has prosciutto peas and mushrooms in a creamy sauce. I got the truffle ravioli this time around too and it was so good, but very rich. The bread that comes with the meals is yummy.The dining area is small, with close tables, and the restaurant can get loud. However, if you're coming at off hours that's not an issue.

A few of us agreed that it reminded us of dorm pizza :/ Oh well- like I said, there were many different pasta dishes to choose from. The one I ordered, Alla Norma, was just okay. It was just some soft eggplant with ricotta. I really liked the dish my boyfriend got, though. It was the Boscaiola with penne, prosciutto, green peas, wild mushrooms, tomato cream. I finished his but not mine! And I get that it's on Newbury, but the prices didn't match the food quality.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Great Italian food in a very central, convenient location. My dad, sister, and I made a reservation for a Saturday night about an hour prior and had absolutely no issues. The restaurant didn't seem too crowded at around 6 PM though we were still seated in a cramped back area. It was a beautiful day and an outdoor table would have been nice, but alas. To start, we ordered the mussels appetizer (cozze con vino) and found it delicious. This was the highlight of the meal -- so fresh and light, with this perfect toasty bread to match. The mussels were sautÃ©ed with garlic and tomatoes and the whole dish was so flavorful; it brought back memories of coastal Italian weekends from study abroad. We then ordered 3 pasta dishes as entrees -- me the boscaiola with fettuccine (prosciutto, green peas, wild mushrooms, tomato cream), my dad the scampi (linguini, tiger shrimp, fresh tomato, lemon white wine), and my sister the fusilli pesto (fusilli, pesto, and wild mushrooms). The buscaiola was FANTASTIC -- the 3 of us were all eating off my plate. The tomato cream sauce was just delectable and the chewiness of the prosciutto paired well with the fettuccine. My dad actually didn't love the scampi though I liked it (tasted super fresh but could have used a little more flavor, in my opinion). My sister's pesto was also good, though not a standout like the others were. They also have a decent wine selection and the service was attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend after a long day of shopping!",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Came here with a friend for dinner on a warm spring day. We sat outside and got salads to celebrate the season (that sounds so lame, but salad seem appropriate when it's warm, right?). I got the Gamberetti and it was a wonderful blend of sweet and savory. The tables are a little close together, but what do you expect? It's Newbury Street in Boston. Real estate is prime! At the end of the meal, two of the waitstaff came by to bring me cake and sing me happy birthday! The chocolate cake was deep, rich, and scrumptious.

We tried the flatbread bianca, spinach gnocchi and zucca (squash) ravioli.

We had the shrimp pasta of the day, the bosciola, and lobster ravioli. Big lumps of lobster. Large prosciutto pieces in the bosciola. Huge shrimp. The homemade bread is nice with a fairly fine olive oil for the table included. We ate and ran but were relatively impressed with the service, too. The space is quaint and able to fit a car seat to the side but likely would have been a little to busy for that at night. I'll definitely be back when around Newbury -- much better than the bland Italian elsewhere around there.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Sometimes, you just don't feel like venturing to the North End for Italian food. Sometimes, you just want to be in the back bay, especially after a long day of shopping. Piattini has excellent Italian food, with slightly higher prices than the North End.We started off with the homemade meatballs, made of beef and pork. They were a good size, and really soft and tender.I can't resist home made pasta- it is so much better than pasta in a box. The bolognese is made with homemade fusilli- ooh the fusilli was so good. You could tell it was homemade, the shape was different from fusilli in a box. It was topped with ground meat, simply amazing.I would highly recommend Piattini if you are looking for great Italian food in the Back Bay!",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"2,"This restaurant was honestly disappointing. several points 1. The waitress gave us two options for water, neither of which was free but failed to clarify, as we later realized when we looked at the check, which felt like a scam 2. The waitress was very rude from the point on when we said we are not ordering wine. We are college age students, not looking to splurge. It seemed like she couldn't bother to wait our tables because we were not white old patrons, like others at the restaurant. 3. The lobster ravioli was undercooked. We called to have the dish taken in and cooked again for us. The lamb was v good, it's the only thing that even earns this place two stars.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Great location, awesome food, and nice service! I've come here a couple of times and have enjoyed the food for this place. The entrance is a little confusing to get to when you walk down, but the after walking in there's two dining sections and a bar area you could sit it. The menu is pretty simple being split into small and large sized dishes to order. The small numbers to the side of each dish represent the wine they recommend pairing the food with. I ordered the capesante, which the scallops were perfectly cooked, so they weren't too rubbery or too fishy tasting. The slight bitter taste of arugula added a nice touch to the pasta and shredded cheese. If you're craving pasta, I'd recommend coming here to get some!",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"3,"I caught up with a friend on Piattini's lovely patio on a surprisingly warm night out in late winter. Â We each ordered two items from the hot small plates menu, including: - Black Truffle Ravioli ($16)- Cranberry and Goat Cheese Ravioli ($12) **- Spinach Gnocchi ($12)Food alone would definitely rank Piattini at four stars. Â I had both of their new hot small plates, and MY GAWD these were phenomenal. Â These are SMALL -- about 4ish ravioli per dish, aka $3-4 per ravioli. Â However, their creativity and BOMB ravioli and their sauces make the sampling worth.I highly recommend the ** Cranberry Goat Cheese Ravioli **. Â The sauce complimented the drier tanginess of the classic cranberry + goat cheese pairing, and it was topped with some sprigs of palate-cleansing arugula. Â As delicious as the Black Truffle Ravioli was, I think the truffle flavor could've been stronger (it was overpowered by the cream sauce).Service: It was a busy night for Piattini, so although we were seated immediately, our service was unfortunately slow. Â It was difficult to catch our waiter's eye from the patio. Â We waited at least 10 minutes just to be SERVED WATER, and at least another 15 minutes before our order was taken. Â They ran out of mushrooms our pasta orders, and they ran out of their complimentary bread later that night, so I think they were understaffed both in the kitchen and on the floor. Â Thank goodness I had a lovely dinner partner to converse with during those waits!IN SUM: Take a gander at this place! Â I imagine it must be lovely when they are not swarmed by people trying to get a breath of fresh air on an unseasonably warm day in the middle of winter. Â I'd definitely try this place again later in the spring.

We were greeted and seated by a lovely waiter. He explained the menu very clearly (the numbers next to the dishes correspond to wine recommendations) and was very charming throughout. As we were there around 6 pm, there were very few people in the restaurant, mostly people at the bar. The waiter gave us good recommendations, and everything we ordered was made perfectly.

The rye and luxardo liquor with blood orange was delicious. The food, however, was bland. The service was fast and the pasta was hot... but that's about it. I got penne pomodoro thinking it's simple and hard to mess up. It's telling if a restaurant can do this well... well, I was less than impressed. The penne was cooked al dente but the sauce tasted like a store could've made. There was nothing special. Plus, if you're going to say basil on the menu, there better be basil in the dish. Nope. The menu is setup as small plates vs regular dishes. The small plates were rather pricy, and it was hard to figure out the size. Maybe I just didn't get the concept or ordered the wrong thing, but it was nothing special. Some of the small plates looked flavorful and unique but without being able to figure out the size even after asking and deciding if one would be enough (multiple for one person could get pricey!), I opted for a pasta entree... who knows if I'd have had a better experience ordering something else. Great location and outdoor setting, with a few occupied tables. I sat at the bar inside... inside was empty apart from myself and one other table.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"4,"What a nice accidental find this was. We were early for reservations around the corner at Moonshine 152 and trying to find a place to have a quick drink. We only did a really quick Google search and were delighted to walk into this beautiful pub. Lots of exposed brick, cool light fixtures, and a big, long bar with plenty of space (it was pretty early).The wonderful surprises continued when I looked over the beer menu and saw at least 3 Trillium beers on draft - mind blown. We were visiting from Portland and despite having plenty of beer-centric bars, Trillium on draft is still a pretty big deal. Turned out they had kicked one, not that it mattered to me as long as one was on, and of course they had some other really good beer offerings as well. I was too busy taking photos of my beer to make friends jealous to remember what my girlfriend got for a cocktail but she loved it. They did have some pretty creative cocktails in my very humble opinion. As mentioned, there was food waiting for us around the corner at Moonshine but what we saw coming out of the kitchen at Worden Hall looked fantastic. What a great neighborhood bar. We'll definitely be back for some food to go with their impressive beer list.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"5,Amazing experience here tonight! Got sent over from the sister restaurant Five Horses since they were closed for electrical issues. The service by Kyle our waiter was phenomenal!Friendly and fast with good recommendations.Food was equally great. I got the nyc strip with veggies. Steak was perfectly cooked and the veggies were fresh and delicious. My girlfriend got the amazing pork buns and some very good broccoli rabe I'm hot oil. The pool boy cocktail was also very inventive and delicious.Free blueberry cobbler not even on the menu for us for making the trip out of our way. We will be back! Thanks also to Ben the manager,Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"5,"We ate there recently during the busy graduation weekend and arrived just as the horse races started, so service was well under way.The Service:Our waitress kept our drinks topped off and was very knowledgable of the wine/beer selection. She was familiar with the food selections as well, and was able to give personal recommendations which is always a great sign (when the staff eat there too!). The manager, Dan, stopped by to greet the tables and we had a great conversation with him (not your typical ""how was the food?"" talk). At times when you could tell the kitchen was getting busy, other wait staff would check on us to make sure the experience was smooth and uninterrupted.The Food:We started off this time with three appetizers; the harissa lamb meatballs, crab cakes, and the chicken wings. The lamb was cooked perfectly; not too gamey, and with the right amount of yogurt and cheese. The crab was phenomenal; soft on the inside, with the right amount of crisp on the out-- definitely NOT over-fried like a lot of other places. The chicken wings were juicy and plump-- not like those tiny meat lollipops you see at other joints. Truth be told, we were kinda nervous we ordered too much food because they were very generous with the portions.For the main courses, we ordered the salmon, NY strip steak, and the scallops.The salmon was flaky and juicy; the accompanying pea puree (something we've never tried) was an unexpected treat that paired very well with the fish.I tried to throw the kitchen a loop by ordering my steak RARE-- something that a lot of places either end up overcooking, or giving to you raw; Worden did not disappoint. That baby was juicy, red, RARE, yet cooked. You could literally pull it apart with your fingers it was so tender. They still got an awesome crisp on the outside. By far my favorite of the three entrees. The scallops were masterfully cooked; not rubbery at all, yet they had a nice firm texture. The brussel sprouts and pancetta that came with them could have been an entree on its own. That was definitely the sleeper hit of the dinner.I'm on a diet, so I skipped the dessert, but to be honest the food was so filling, would have been hard to squeeze in anyway. This place is one of my favorites in Boston; it hits hard at those comfort food soft spots I have, and going there during the winter time or just a rainy day totally nails the aesthetic they're trying to achieve. We will definitely be back!",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"3,"If location is everything in real estate, it's only part of the thing in restaurants. Worden Hall has a great location, if you're tied to the Red Line. You come out of the T at Broadway and there it is. Directly across the street. Very close. Imagine meeting friends during a snowstorm. No trudging through slush or scaling snowbanks. It's right there. So civilized. The drawback is that the food is just okay and often uneven, just like the service. At the tables, it feels like a chain. Think Applebees or Average Joe's, and that's not meant as a slam to either of those. Sometimes they're just what you want but you never go there expecting culinary excitement. You just get food, sometimes better than others. The bar is beautiful, long and clean and comfy and spacious and constructed out of thousand and one shellacked pennies. It stirs the imagination. Who did this? How? I like sitting there. And the beer selection is pretty extensive. But the food comes from the same kitchen as the food at the tables. It's meh. Uneven. It should be amazing. It's not. I will definitely go back for beer with friends. I'll go for conversation and convenience. I won't expect much from the food. I'll probably be happy.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"The soppressata and sausage deep dish pizza is amazing!

We walked over a mile to get there from our hotel. We didn't need to make a reservation, we were one of five parties in the place, but we did, because it was brunch time, and you never know in the city.It really does have a cool atmosphere, sort of an old world feel. The waitress was nice, but completely botched our order. She seem distracted while she was taking it down. I ordered a meal that came with eggs any style, but she never asked me what kind I wanted. When it became evident that she was not going to, I said ""Can I get my eggs that come with that scrambled?"" She told me that she would have to check on that. The meal came with a charred tomato, and I specifically asked not to have one included. Hot tomatoes disgust me, personal preference. 15 minutes later, our breakfasts arrived, and one of them was a breakfast sandwich, which Neither of us had not ordered. Everyone was seemingly confused, but they must have found our original order, because the correct meals came out 15 minutes later. (The charred tomato was not omitted on mine.) Sadly, I think my husband's never got remade, I think it sat there while they made what I had originally ordered, because his scrambled eggs were cold. At that point, we didn't want to send anything back, because time was now an issue, and we didn't want to make the waitress, who did come over and apologize, feel worse. After we ate, we sat there for an extended period of time, and had to ask the waitress for our check, even though we had indicated we were all set. I am going with some charitable assumption, and think she may be new. Some kinks to work out there. It's a limited menu, so I recommend getting to know it well.The food was decent, we would maybe consider giving it a try for dinner at some point, but overall not as praiseworthy as we were led to believe from fellow Yelpers.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"3,Went here for brunch this past weekend with 8 people. We did make a reservation but there were plenty of open tables. It was raining though. The mimosa flight was the best part. 3 stars because no one really liked their meal. Waffles and breakfast sandwich were soggy. Mac and cheese was drenched in liquid cheese. The donut holes were tasty! Probably wouldn't return here.,Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"We stopped in for a Saturday night dinner and got right in around 8 PM. We got our drink orders in and they were quickly delivered. In a bit of an oddity we had one person take our drink order, another deliver it, and then a third server show up to take our food order. The third server stuck with us the rest of the night, but there was no explanation as to why we had the revolving door series of servers - we didn't take it personally; might have just been shift change.Anyhow...I opted for the Cheesesteak, which was very flavorful and quite delicious. I opted for the fresh green salad option and it was packed full of dark greens and had a nice light dressing-wonderful overall. My wife got a nightly special Fall Pappardelle. It was pretty good, with delightfully plump and tasty pearl onions, but was a bit buttery for her taste although there was a good mix of ingredients.Service was good, even/because? of the rotating servers, and prices were very reasonable.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"This is the place I choose to celebrate my 23rd birthday with a couple friends. Got off to a terrific start, but unfortunately, the awesomeness did not carry through my whole experience. Because of some logistics, I got here around an hour before we had agreed to meet, so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered an Old Fashioned, and some Pork Buns. The Old Fashioned was very strong. If you are not a fan of whiskey, then this one is definitely not for you. The drink was made with Bulleit, which I am not a fan of... however, to his credit, the bartender did give me a choice, I just told him ""your preference"".Pork Buns were spectacular all around, but be warned, there are jalapeÃ±os in there, so they come with quite a kick! Anyways, the pork belly was great, I liked that they were tender enough to melt in your mouth, but also preserved some of that friend/grilled flavor. The sauce was delightfully savory, and tangy, rather than a run-of-the-mill saccharine BBQ sauce. The vegetable slaw added a wonderful crunch. I devoured these with great joy.Bar service was pretty nice, although I must say before 5:30 the bar was close to capacity, but there was only one bartender. The crowd wasn't too demanding, and service was relatively quick considering there was one bartender running the show. Not to worry, It wasn't one person the whole night, as two more came in at 5:30.Fast forward a little bit, my friends are all here and we are ordering food! For an appetizer, we ordered the chicken wings. These were middle-of-the-road. They were cooked pretty well, and they had a great amount of BBQ sauce on them, enough to add flavor, not so much that you need 32 napkins to clean up afterward. My critique here is that the bleu cheese was extremely chunky. Because of how everything was plated, I ended up just grabbing a rather large piece of bleu cheese. Let me tell you... bleu cheese is great with wings or celery, but not on its own! Then came the pulled pork sandwich... after the pork buns, I was excited to try this! I was expecting the same range of flavors, with softness and crunch, sugar and spice, and everything nice... alas, I was denied. There were several things that caused this break-down. First, the cabbage slaw did not add any noticeable crunch. Not only was it not crunchy, there wasn't very much of it either. The pulled pork was overcooked and rather dry, desperately needing some more sauce. On a positive note, the bread was very pleasant! The curly fries were delicious too, cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. Then, there's the grand finale of the ice cream sandwich, which we split amongst the table. This one was also middle of the road. While there was some peanut-y sauce and candied peanuts, the ice cream didn't read as peanut butter to me, nor did I get a heavy reading on salted caramel. I should mention that I didn't see this listing on the dessert menu (server just told us ""ice cream sandwich""), but I would hope to be able to pick up on it.Overall service was nice and fairly attentive, although as it got a little later in the evening, it took a little while to get the food out, quite a bit longer than it took the pork buns... but then again, two of my friends ordered burgers, and those take a bit to cook.  It was the baos that showed me this places potential, which was why the sandwich was such a disappointment. But, they also showed what it is capable of, and that it could have just been a couple misfires. This said, I look forward to returning at some point and giving them another shot!",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"Good brunch spot. Â Cool vibe and ambiance, yet still kid friendly.

Good but average. hm...so I decided to try out, we got some cocktails, lobster roll and deep dish pizza...but a-ok..nothing crazy, nothing astonishing, nothing rememberable... Deep dish was kinda disappointment...yes its slightly thicker than ordinary pizzas but....its nothing like chicago style...Worth $20 + tip and tax? highly doubt it...lobster roll was better....but nothing crazy again...its was good but nothing i would die to come back for it.Overall average pricey food.

It looks so great from the outside and the location has such potential. The service, no matter who you get, is terrible. The food is blah and not even presented in a pleasant way. Something always goes wrong, takes forever, is forgotten...Too bad! Hope it gets sold or something. Now that the Maiden is gone, it's even more sad.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"Overall I like Worden Hall. I have been for lunch a few times but this is my first Brunch.Service: not very attentive. They took a while to take our order and delivered our mimosas to the wrong table. The food came pretty quick.Food/Drink: We got mimosas that were priced pretty well at 4$ and were an average mimosa, nothing special. We got a side of home fries that we're good but over priced for the size. Both plates we got were portioned small. We got the Saratoga French Toast and the Huevos Rancheros Tacos. There were 2 pieces of French toast and 2 tacos. Both were very tasty but small portions. The French Toast was very filling but over priced for the amount you get.Overall: good atmosphere. Quality food. Small portions. Overpriced for portion size.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"Chicken, chicken, and chicken. That is what was ordered here today for our tasting. My mom and I came for brunch and we shared the Chicken n Waffles - crispy breaded chicken breast, Belgian waffle, spicy maple syrup, Crispy Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sammy - Cabot cheddar, lettuce, tomato, applewood bacon and avocado ranch and the Crispy Chicken Wings Carolina-style BBQ buttermilk ranch, celery, blue cheese. We were very pleased with the food and felt all the chicken dishes we got was very thick and meaty. The chicken and waffles, that chicken was a little dry versus the buttermilk chicken which was not as dry. And for the chicken wings was wonderful but the blue cheese like the ranch dressing should be on the side instead of poured all over the chicken. I didn't mind it but not everyone likes blue cheese. Overall, brunch was good and I will be curious about dinner when I come back next time! Great job and place.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"4,"Trendy spot with tasty food. Â Worden hall is conveniently located close to the broadway T so although there is no parking, it is very easy to get to. Â The restaurant also has a nice ambiance and has a wide beer selection.

The atmosphere is nice. They use their space well. The food was okay. The service wasn't the best.I had a burger and a churro sundae. They were both pretty good. The wait for the food was long but it was pretty packed.It's a nice place to grab a drink or dinner in Southie.,Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1,Awful awful awful! The food is bland as anything. Clam chowder was flavorless in a thin liquid broth. I had to put like 30 dashes of salt to get any resemblance of flavor.Pizza is literally digiorno frozen pizza. I'm not joking.Drinks are over priced. Beers are $7.50 and up. Service is slow.Wouldn't send my worst enemy here. Straight garbage.We had to special order ICE for our water. Freaking ICE!,Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"3,"Cozy restaurant!!!Went there for a snack, pork buns = delicious, and would like to visit again and explore more of their options.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"2,"Wow. What an incredibly frustrating and disappointing brunch here yesterday.Myself and a few friends had brunch reservations for 12:15. When we arrived we were told they were just busing our table and we'd be able to sit shortly. At 12:40 we were finally seated, so clearly that was a lie and they didn't want to admit they just seat people and don't respect reservations. Meanwhile the hostess was not only unapologetic but shockingly cold and apathetic. Not at all the warm welcome you expect from such a highly rated spot. We were finally seated in the very back of the restaurant and proceeded to only see our server occasionally. She was fairly quick to take drink orders, but then disappeared for 20 minutes before coming back to ask about food.Drinks were very yummy but a bit odd in pricing and sizes. The regular mimosa is only $4 which is a steal, but the bellini that's the same size as the mimosa is $9 and the jumbo mimosa (also $9) is enormous. I just don't understand how they determine prices. You really don't know what you're getting until you order. I also had a cappuccino which was small and not that great. Not terrible by any means, but no better than you'd get at a chain coffee shop.The menu was super impressive and there were so many things I was interested in trying. Unfortunately food took AN HOUR to arrive. 20 minutes after we ordered the waitress came by to tell us that the kitchen was really backed up and she didn't know how long it would take for our food. She apologized, but that was it. No offer of a comped round of drinks while we waited (we ended up ordering a second round just cause we had so much time to kill) or a side or something to munch on while we wait. We were all insanely hungry by the time food finally arrived. Some kind of token gesture of ""hey, we're really fucking up right now and we're so sorry"" would have made the insane wait more palatable. It was completely unacceptable. When it finally arrived the food was delicious. J had the omelet and loved it. I opted for the fried chicken sandwich which, while not my favorite ever, was still pretty great. Can't go wrong with fried chicken. As a bonus, it comes with fries or greens and they'll let you do half and half if you want. Love when places are okay with that. E had the mac and cheese with pork belly which, while fabulous, was a pretty small serving size considering it was comparably priced to other menu items. Like the drinks, you just don't know what you're getting when you order. Let's recap: 12:15 reservation. 12:40 seated. 2PM WE FINALLY GET FOOD.It was absurd. Yummy as the food was, there's too many tasty brunch spots in Boston to ever give this place even a passing second glance.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"5,"One of our fav places in the neighborhood. We love this place. They change their draft beer menu pretty often, it is fun to try new beer every single time we go here. They have so many different beer!! Beer flight is a good way to try different ones. 1. Starters: pretzel is amazing! It comes out soft and hot, great with beer cheese and mustard. Wings are so good as well.2. Salad: fried chicken salad is my fav. Their fried chicken is very delicious.3. Main: interestingly their tacos are better than many Mexican restaurants. Fried chicken sammy is always delicious. Their burger is a must-try. With tater totes, it is incredible. KFCGH: very nice fried chicken with mash potato and mac & cheese but it is not the most healthy dish obviously. We really enjoyed yellow curry too. Very flavorful (but very spicy). The only dish I was not overwhelmed was duck burrito, it was a bit too salty for me. Overall, the quality of food, beer and services is amazing. We love the vibes as well. Such a gem in the neighborhood!",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"It's a great place to come for a nice, greasy brunch and some good cocktails. It's one of those places where they don't do it all well because they try and do everything, but they have their specialties. To Order: Mimosa Flight (if you haven't been told already)- a beautiful rainbow of decently portioned cocktails!I was not too impressed by my power bowl, which said it came with sesame tofu but that part didn't make the cut apparently... It was just some nuts and bagged spinach. Next time I know to get something heavier and greasier, like the Heart Surgeon (which my boyfriend ordered). It had hash, eggs, onions, and was topped with biscuits.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"There are a lot of great things about Five Horses Tavern. The mimosa flight was innovative and fun to order. There were four - one similar to your classic mimosa but more acidic which I liked, a lime ish flavored one which I thought was just okay, a fresh strawberries one which I liked as much as the classic, and a red one that I literally could not figure out what it was but I did not like it. $18 for a mimosa flight wasn't a terrible flight given that a mimosa typically goes for $10.My boyfriend ordered the Southern Chicken (2 large biscuits, 2 fried chicken and 2 eggs over gravy). The biscuits were tasty, but so dense and I couldn't even eat more than 1/3 of one. Eggs and gravy were decent. The fried chicken, however, was the most conflicting piece for me. The outside was so well seasoned and tasty, but because there is a lot of chicken, it was fairly dry - even the gravy was not enough to offset the dryness. I ordered the Breakfast Club (essentially chicken club with waffles instead of toast). The Breakfast Club comes with a side and we got tater tots for that, then ordered another larger side of beef & pork belly hash. The Breakfast Club was very difficult to eat (see pictures) but the hot sauce on there stood out the most for me. The weirdest concept though is to put the hot sauce all the way on the top of the club and the chicken was all the way on the bottom. They would have been great together. The tater tots were spiced well and the beef and pork belly hash had such a great texture - but I did not taste much potato and it was salty.Probably would not come back for brunch, but would like to come for the beer flights as I saw many beers on tap at the bar!",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"2,"Came here with my boyfriend during my birthday trip to Boston after reading mostly good reviews on Yelp. It took 20 minutes to get a table, but we were able to get a nice table outside on a beautiful day and a view of the sunset. My boyfriend ordered the beer flight ($15) and I a peach pale ale ($6.50). We also ordered the bottomless cupcakes - chocolate cupcakes filled with cream cheese filling and paired with passion fruit coulis ($8). Sounds delicious right? Wrong. I was in the mood for dessert and the cupcakes we received were nowhere near ""filled"" with any sort of filling. They were empty, small, and the coulis was just some type of drizzle on the plate. The concept of this dessert could've been great, but this place failed to deliver. My pale ale was really good, but when the waitress brought the 4 beer flight out to our table, she managed to SPILL IT ALL OVER MY BOYFRIEND. So she apologizes and gets a towel, comes back and wipes down the table while my boyfriend is standing there, soaked, with nothing to wipe down. She then proceeds to offer him the towel she JUST USED to wipe the table down and says (I kid you not) that the towel is clean and dry and he can use it to wipe himself down if he'd like. My boyfriend handled the situation well but the waitress handled her mistake pretty badly. She brought out the flight again and placed it on the table the same exact way she did the first time. Given, our table was slanted because it was outside but she put the flight tray parallel to the slant so of course it's going to fall! Basic physics!!!Anyway, we asked for the manager and he gladly comped the beer flight, but the waitress was pretty measly and unaware. She was a bit rude too when we tried to make light of the situation...Anyway, 2 stars for this place because the quality of the dessert was subpar, but the atmosphere is nice. Won't be back.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"2,"Meh. Disappointed and conflicted lunch puppy. This is actually an update of my previous review, which also had 2 stars. My last experience, the food was very good, but the service was really really slow and terrible. Today I went for lunch with a friend, we got there at 12:00 pm ordered 2 avocado tacos and a French Kiss pizza. The food took FOREVER to come in. We finally got it at around 12:40 pm and GOBBLED it because we were starving and had to be back to work at 1 pm. So still disappointed with the service.On the other hand, â€‹if you are here the French Kiss pizza is very very good! The avocado tacos are pretty good as well. I wish they cooked the corn tortillas more, but it was a good meal.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,The food was so good. My Mom and I stared with sharing mimosa flight. Then we shared the french toast sticks. Â Now these were not your average french toast sticks... these were elevated and we loved them. Then I had a nice lighter option of a tofu bowl... very good also - perfect after heavier french toast sticks. Â Server was great and was sweet about extra plates and cup to share items.,Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"2,2.5 Stars. The menu has great variety but I felt theirâ€‹ food was lacking quality. We tried their tacos and they didn't seem all that fresh or tasty. I got the O.D.B and it was just okay. There was a ton of food on the plate but it just didn't work for me. The pulledâ€‹ pork was dry and the biscuit was hard. I liked their homefriesâ€‹ and tater tots - you can't really mess that up though. And finally - the mimosa flights look great on Instagramâ€‹ but the just flavors were just okay. Our waitress visited the table like twice. Five Horses Tavern is just an average place for brunch.,Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"Review for the cocktails -Basically they sound a lot tastier on paper than they did in real life. My two friends and I all got different libations, and although I liked mine the best (a spicy tequila), I was very unimpressed by the others. I wish I remembered what they were called, but they essentially reminded me of a watered down juice with soda and a splash of alcohol. Maybe it was the bartender? Who knows. The vibe was cool and there were a lot of people around, so I have no doubt that this place has some great stuff to offer...but next time I would probably stick with beer or wine.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"Five Horses is really close by and a great place to go when you don't want to ponder for hours where to go. I'd recommend making a reservation on the weekends through OpenTable to avoid wait times.During the summer, they have a patio and is great for people watching and enjoying a nice pitcher of sangria. I'm giving four stars as the last two times (of the hundreds visited) there wasn't great service and food was cold. However, this was truly the first and second time this has happened in the past five years I've been going here.  We ordered the oxtail chili, cornbread and roasted chicken. All of which normally is fantastic but served room temperature/semi-cold this time around. I'd recommend the Mac n cheese, pizzas and kale salad for when you go in! Definitely a great place to try.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"This is THE place for an indulgent and unique brunch. I came around 11am with a pal and there wasn't a long wait. I had so much trouble choosing between three different options on the menu - a fried chicken and biscuit number, a pulled pork Benedict, and a brunch pizza with a baked egg and hollandaise sauce. I mean, all of these sounded sooo drool-worthy!In the end, I went for the pulled pork Benny and have no regrets. The pork was tender with some crispy bits and the eggs were large and yolky. What more could I ask for? My friend got the burger and also enjoyed it. We left incredibly stuffed but also very happy.In addition, our server was super friendly and gave some good guidance on what to order. The ambience is like your classic old timer tavern, and we got a bar seat facing the window to do a bit of people watching as we munched. I will be back since that brunch pizza is still playing on my mind!",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"Had a really great time here. I went a few months ago with my boyfriend for lunch and we loved our dishes. I ordered the curry entree and a veggie taco as an appetizer - both were delicious! My boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger with tater tots and the tots were incredible! Burger was also juicy and well seasoned. We both ordered the Garden Mule and they were great. Not too strong, and the cucumber and basil were great additions. They have wonderful gluten free and vegetarian options, which I always appreciate in a restaurant. I would love to come here again (only reason I gave 4 stars was because I have only been here once) for brunch or dinner! Lovely spot in the South End.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"3,"Brunch is my favorite meal so I have high expectations.. but I thought this place was average! The menu sounded really good but the actual food was okay. I got the heart surgeon, which the waitress recommended to me. The beef and pork hash were too well cooked for my taste. The edges of my skillet were burnt by some of the meat. My toast was also burnt. This is probably not a reflection of all the heart surgeons that they serve, but my particular dish was definitely over cooked. Also, the service was good but slow. It took awhile for our dishes to come out and it was not that busy that particular Saturday morning. However, I'm still interested in giving them another chance next time.

The prices are very affordable for how much food you get, but be warned - there are very few ""light"" or ""healthy eating"" dishes. You can certainly order mesclun greens or the black bean hash as sides, but most of the food is sausage/fried chicken/bacon/delicious cheddar grits. I actually only ate the cheddar grits side for breakfast and was completely full, even though I'd also ordered the Heart Surgeon. Be warned, the heart surgeon is EXTREMELY heavy, with no vegetables in sight. It was delicious the next day, but was so big and heavy that I made it into 2 meals. We also ordered the donut holes for the table, which were perfectly fried but not too heavy. And we've also heard great things about the drinks although we didn't partake in them. Our waitress was a bit clumsy, but we didn't mind so much since we had a great time socializing.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,We tried the tuna tacos which were good Â although corn tortillas not really hot enough!

Â We ordered apps to share, including both plain and loaded tater tots (since when did this become grown-up food?), chicken wings, and soft pretzels. Â The food was very average - not bad, but definitely not remarkable in any way. Â I would have loved to see a vegetable in there somewhere, but the group I was with was not really into that so maybe I'll have to come back to try the brussels sprouts, elote, ""pea diddy"" etc. Â On the other hand, the drink selection was pretty excellent, with a wide range of styles from craft breweries including both local (Night Shift, Trillium) and not-so local (Founders, Green Flash) favorites. Â At first I was impressed by the relatively low draft prices, but it seems they pour 8 oz rather than 12 so it pretty much evens out.This place has great atmosphere, on a picturesque street corner in the south end, with sidewalk seating and large open windows - a prime spot to spend a summer evening with friends. Â They do take table reservations, which I would recommend for groups. Â It's also worth noting that our service was very good.

The brunch is okay, kinda an odd menu, so check it out before you go in. I've had the chimichanga, which was good but definitely out of the ordinary. The tater tots are out of this world. I would recommend it more for lunch or dinner because the menu is a little more normal without being boring. I have had the burger which was good. It's a good spot if you don't have a reservation because I've never seen it super crowded and they can usually accommodate a larger party.

We ate here once in the fall and just recently for Valentine's Day. We really enjoyed the food and I think the beer selection is really nice. Also great service both times and relaxed atmosphere. We had the calamari special which was very tasty. Then I ordered the Mac and cheese on the waitress's recommendation, with pulled pork. My wife had the burger which I ate half of. Overall we enjoyed both meals but I wasn't blown away by the Mac and cheese. It was heavy on the cheese and light on the pork. I would've preferred a better balance but I still enjoyed it. The burger was very delicious and well prepared. The beer selection (see pics) was solid and they charge about $3 more for a trillium than you buy in a can so I gotta say that ain't bad.

At first I was thrown off by the French names of the classic asian dishes. It was $33 for a three course meal. APPETIZER: I ordered the Chilled Avocado Citrus Soup which was unbelievably refreshing. Perfect balance of all the flavors. My friend got the Rouleaux which is basically a spring roll and she said it was very delicious. She got the mushroom substitute. ENTREE: you cannot go wrong with the grilled rainbow trout! All the elements of the dish complemented each other so perfectly - from the jasmine rice, to the Chinese broccoli, to the spicy marinade! The fish was also very well done. DESSERT: You have to get the coconut milk custard. DELICIOUS! I would come back for this alone!! The description had squash in it which I thought was a little strange but it worked so well with the coconut custard. Overall: from just reading the menu, I was truthfully a little skeptical. I thought it was just going to be like a regular asian place with French names. They also had this Mango Sticky Rice as an option but named it something way different.

Slow.I was really looking forward to dinner at elephant walk, as I remembered 5+ years ago they had the best Cambodian food, and an amazing b'baw mouan soup. Now the restaurant is overpriced, and tastes nothing like authentic Cambodian.Starters:Rouleaux (pork) - this dish is clumsily deep fried, similar to a Chinese take out egg roll. The filling lacked flavor and needed the sauce, which was too sweet.Dumplings (pork) - $8 for 6 small dumplings, this was similarly deep fried and diaappointingRouleaux (tuna) - this was good, bright flavors, tuna and avocado tasted very freshB'baw mouan (chicken) - this was super disappointing and overwhelmingly sweet. There was no balance of flavor - It is supposed to taste like garlic, shallots, fresh herbs, lime, chicken base.Entrees:Khar saiko kroeng (beef noodle) - this tasted like a Chinese beef noodle dish, except with a lot of sugar / sweetness added. The beef is good, but every bite tastes of sweet beef broth.Kari tieh (duck noodle) - the duck was braised well, and the dish has a relatively unique flavor.We had 7 people but I did not try the other entrees.Overall the food here has gone down in quality and flavor, yet they can charge a higher price because there is no other Cambodian food around. Dinner with 1 sangria came out to $55/person, and it's honestly it's not worth the price.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Great food and great service. This place deserves more attention!I've come here twice and I've been impressed with everything that I've tried. I would highly recommend starting off with an order of their spring rolls... The ones here are very different from the typical fast food spring roll you may be thinking of.Can't go wrong with any of the entrees, but my personal favorite is the loc lac. The meat is so tender and flavor packed.If you're looking for something sweet, definitely end with their flourless chocolate cake. It is so rich and creamy- definitely a unique dessert. Overall, I highly recommend this place. It is more under the radar so it does not get as crowded as other places around Boston either.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Finally got to try out this place and it did not disappoint! Â I'm not familiar with French Cambodian cuisine so I cannot confirm its authenticity, but I can definitely confirm its tastiness and creativity. I ordered two of the appetizers for a meal because there were so many good options. Would definitely come back to try more! Â Settled on: **Polenta Et Canard BraisÃ© Aux Champignons** (duck polenta, $13) and **Nataing** (coconut ground pork and crispy rice, $10). Â Thankfully, there were helpful English translations of what these dishes were for my ignorant American self ~ 100% would order the duck polenta again. I especially appreciated the shredded raw snow peas on top. Their perfect crisp texture and freshness complemented this savory and creamy dish wonderfully. As for the coconut ground pork and crispy rice, the meat/sauce-y portion was wonderfully balanced and comforting, but it felt disjointed when combined with the crispy rice. Portions were off between the two, and the rice bars didn't take to the sauce well and vice versa. It just didn't go. For my drink, I got the **Amalfi 75** ($12) because I am partial to gin cocktails. Â It was good, could've been stronger for my tastes.

The sourdough bread with oil comes as a complimentary meal. The bread was fresh and tasted good. We ordered Rouleaux Dinner (vegetarian) - these are Cambodia. spring rolls which has to be stuffed between lettuce, basil,bell pepper and radish. The server will explain you if you are a first time eater. For entrees, we ordered Kari Tieh- duck with shanghai noodles. It tasted similar to a thai soup but with bold flavors. Second, we ordered from their feature menu- chicken and rice dish with syrupy sauce. Their feature menu changes with the season. The next change will occur on Thursday (7/12/2018). This was their spring to summer menu collection. I will definitely visit them when they change their menu to some cooler summer vibes!!!",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"3,"If you're looking to grab dinner with a group of people who have mixed dietary preferences/restrictions and varied tastes, Elephant Walk is a solid choice. They offer French and Cambodian inspired dishes and flavors and mark vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options on their menu. I came here for my friend's birthday dinner and it was Dine Out Boston week by coincidence. While some of my friends opted to order a la carte, I decided to go for the prefixe menu, which was set at three courses for $33. I ordered the mussels, Porc au Caramel, and a coconut milk custard. The mussels were cooked in garlic, scallion, jalapeno, and red peppers. It lacked a kick but was still tasty. I regretted not ordering the Rouleaux, which is their signature crispy Cambodian pork spring rolls. The Porc au Caramel was slow-cooked pork in a caramelized broth with mushrooms, black pepper, garlic, and peanuts and served with rice. The pork was definitely tender and delicious, but didn't wow me. I enjoyed the coconut milk custard at the end. It was delightfully light. I personally was kind of underwhelmed by my experience at Elephant Walk, especially after reading glowing reviews. However, my friend, who was celebrating her birthday, loved her food (she ordered the Rouleaux to share with another friend and Loc Lac). My friends enjoyed the drinks and were surprised by the strength of the alcohol in them. Some dishes lacked the spice that was promised, which disappointed us. Overall, the Elephant Walk was a pleasant place for dinner (good but not particularly remarkable). Again, I would recommend it for the diets they can accommodate for. No one needs to sacrifice or be excluded to keep a group happy. The prices are a bit steep for what they serve in my opinion, but there are some gems. And they have a good bar.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"3,"I've had Cambodian food before in super casual homey settings. But Elephant Walk is next-level fancy Cambodian food with a super heavy French influence! We ordered the Loc Lac and the Seared Tofu Curry. The Loc Lac was CRAZY tender. I've had a lot of beef in my life (and veal too), but never one so ridiculously soft. It actually dissolves in your mouth in smoothness with little/no chewing work needed. It was honestly a bit foreign to me how amazingly tender it was! Flavor-wise, the dish was yummy. The Loc Lac tasted very authentic and comparable to the Vietnamese version I grew up eating. Saucy with subtle kicks of garlic - it went great with the accompanying white rice!The Seared Tofu curry was also flavorful and simple. It was a little small in portion but came with a variety of squash and mushrooms to give you a nice mixture of textures.Overall, the meal was tasty, but I wouldn't say I was blown away by the flavor. I was and am still amazed by the quality of the meat though!!",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,This restaurant is perfect for those with a gluten allergy or those with specific dietary restrictions. My friends who are gluten free swear by this place and it's one of their favorite go to spots. The inside is spacious with a lot of tables and a large bar area. The food is delicious French and Cambodian fusion with all the food filled with lots of flavor. The dumplings were delicious with a crispy crust instead of the normal soft or fried outside. I had the Bavette A L'Echalotte and loved the steak. The meat was tender and the sauce added a nice punch. I also really enjoyed the shoe string fries. My dinner mate had the Boeuf Bourguignon and loved it!,The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,Amazing food and very knowledgeable waiter! The place is rather small so make sure that you book a table in advance. Go for the Cambodian menu. I wish I had discovered this place months ago...!,The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"My daughter and I have been trying to visit spots in Boston with cuisines from all over the world. We had never had Cambodian food before, so we looked on Yelp to find a place during our stay. The Elephant Walk has five stars and amazing reviews, so we decided on it. Let me tell you: this place did not disappoint. The ambiance is calm and comfortable, and the space has plenty of seating. My daughter made a reservation, and we showed up a few minutes late but the staff was nice and didn't seem to mind. For appetizers, we had the Rouleaux (pork spring rolls) and a seasonal noodle dish of which I do not remember the name. Both were tasty. We liked the noodles more, but the technique of eating the rolls was something new to the both of us. You wrap the rolls in lettuce, add bean sprouts in the mix and dip the entire thing into the sauce. Yummy!!For entrees, I had the Loc Lac (delicious!) because I wanted to try something traditional. My daughter had the seasonal shrimp and noodle dish, which I liked too! The restaurant was short staffed, and there was only one man who was working as a server and a host. He did a perfect job. He was very friendly despite simultaneously serving 6 other parties. Overall, We could not have chosen a better spot to eat. 5 Stars!",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Visiting from out of town. Went to the SOWA studios on Harrison. Walking back to Columbus and wanted a beverage. My friend, who lives in Cambridge, said Elephant Walk is one of her favorite places. We only stopped for s drink but ended up having dinner at the bar. I had a prix fixed menu of rouleaux (pork spring rolls with mint), scallops on fresh corn, and a chocolate torte. Also two different wines. The AlbariÃ±o was from Spain and excellent. The Rose was French and also great. Service was with a smile. Very nice spot.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"This place is amazing!!!I would have sent some pictures but it was so good that I forgot.This has to be top 5 favorite please for me in Boston.The food to taste to service to price ratio is probably unbeatable.I miss that they used to be in Fenway which was easier to get to, but still very much worth the journey.The natang, duck sandwich, crepes are all delightful.I do not think you can go wrong here no matter what you choose to go with.Just a overall great place through and through.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Real solid food and drinks here, had the spring rolls, which were fantastic...

French and Cambodian food - everything is delicious!,The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"3,"The Elephant Walk South End was an anticipated dining experience, but sadly fell short of our expectations - 3.5/5Food Highlights - We have to say the mussels (Leah Chah) were the best restaurant mussels we've ever experience. The broth mixed with garlic, scallion and Asian basil with a hint of spice from jalapeno was amazing. The desserts also were a homerun - we enjoyed the coconut milk custard with Kabocha squash and the passion fruit mousse in the almond lace cup.Food Let Downs - Most other dishes really lacked flavor. The pork belly spring rolls were the most flavorless pork dish we've ever tasted. When we received the entrees, the Shrimp Malika had an amazing sauce, but the shrimp itself lacked much any of any flavor. Additionally, we were turned off of the Poc au Caramel due to the soggy peanuts were also soggy which did not provide the meal with a great texture. We've been excited to try this place for a while but we were disappointed with the lack of flavor in most dishes. Also, the dining experience would have been much better considering the staff that was more worried about sitting at the bar and talking with each other than they were waiting on tables. All of these reasons left us without a great first impression - 3.5/5",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"It was not my intention to eat here but when walking by, the name caught my eye. I like elephants so I checked out the menu. Â To my pleasant surprise, they serve French Cambodian food.As soon as I knew it was Cambodian food I had to go in. I was hoping they had Lok Lak and sure enough they did. Having been to Cambodia 3 times, this is always my favorite so order this. Â I also tried the fried dumplings. Â The dumplings, although fried were more of a pastry shell. Â I liked this as it was not greasy and taste great. The Lok Lak also taste great and very authentic. My only regret was that I ordered the 4 oz. plate instead of the 8oz. option.I also tried the chocolate truffle cake for dessert. On the small side but was the perfect size after a meal. Â Next time I'll order the 8oz Lok Lak.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Hands down my all-time favorite restaurant in Boston. Â I come here several times a month.

Â They also have really good wine but alas I've developed an allergy and can no longer enjoy. Â EW has the most amazing flavors in everything I've eaten here. Â I first had this place when they were off of Beacon Street near Brookline. Â They then moved to Washington and changed a bit, but I'm glad of the location switch because I can walk here if I want.I really love this place and am always worried it will go away because it's never that busy when I go.

We were starving, so we decided to adventure down Washington and find another spot. When we saw the Cambodian/French fusion menu, we decided to pop in and I am so happy about that decision.The restaurant ambiance is perfect. Not gimmicky, classy and simple. We sat at the bar and ordered anything that looked good. Drinks were spot on and well-mixed, and there was a very decent beer selection. House-infused vodkas, top-shelf liquors and some rare flavors like fig and orange infused whiskey made for some interesting and tasty mixed drinks that I haven't seen anywhere else.For dinner, we ordered dumplings, spring rolls and the pork belly special. We split the green papaya salad with shrimp, and I got the short ribs and he ordered the catfish. Every dish was perfectly cooked and spiced. The compliment of flavors, especially in that salad, were spot on. My short ribs were tender and the sauce they were cooked in was so delicately spiced and flavorful. The papaya salad blew me away. I want the recipe for that dressing! My partner's catfish was perfectly cooked, flaky and crunchy on the crust. The fish itself had a nice light flavor. The heat on everything was a slow-build, but we were provided complimentary hot sauced that layered on the spice, if desired. The food was elegantly plated and professionally presented. I have no complaints at all. It was the fanciest and most delicious Cambodian food I've ever had.Our bartender was very friendly, service was prompt and attentive. If I am in the area, my partner and I will absolutely be back. They seem to rotate the menu a lot, which is exciting for someone who likes to have their taste buds challenged and doesn't rely on routine. If you're someone who relies on ""the usual"" when they come into a restaurant, that might be annoying to you or a deterrent, but this place is so worth being a bit adventurous in your eating. Would highly recommend all around, be it for just a cocktail and some apps or a full meal.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Very cute and nowadays a hip place to grab a bite.Use the valet at Boston Chops closeby or take the T.... there's NO parking ever in the South End and especially not on Washington. This restaurant is right across from Cathedral high. Once you've gotten in, you'll see that large parties are NOT a great idea. Thusly any table size over 6 needs to have a reservation Â - because their tables can barely seat 4. Tight quarters aside, you'll find this to be a very relaxing, well decorated , exposed brick of an interior that is quite cozy warm in the colder months. Â It is French Cambodian but the atmosphere leans toward a southeast asian and modern contemporary feel. Not cliche at all actually, but very elegant without being pretentious. Gold elephants, red velvet and wood. Most of the dishes can be ordered in a appetizer size or full meal size. I love this anywhere I see it. Also makes for a great night out of sampling, almost like tapas.. except not al all lol. For a family member's b day , we had a lovely array of foods from dumplings, to salads, duck with polenta, Â salmon and classic beef bourginon. Â All of them were plentiful, sumptuously seasoned, and FRESH in all the ingredients. Skip the green salad unless you hae a case of scurvy and need leafy greens - its just that, nothing more. Save tummy real estate for the Beef Short ribs, Shrimp laden noodles and other steamy delights from the little kitchen! Â The service while somewhat slow for a weeknight dinner was very thoughtful an nice. Our waiter even offered to snap a photo of us all between bites. All of the desserts were also phenomenal and exactly as described. They also very happy to annouce - they have esspresso, lattees and cappucinos as well ! Â If you have a sweet spot for chocolate, it is the chocolate torte that can't be missed.. SO much more than a chocolate cake. It can't be described - it must be experienced!

It's a giant open space filled with high wood tables, ornate pillars encircled by dragons, funky wall decor, and an anthropomorphic sheet metal octopus sits behind the bar above bottles of Japanese whiskey.I had the Sea and Smoke cocktail to start: an Asian twist on Pencillin with strong flavours of ginger and citrus (as expected) and also sake and yuzu.The maki we had was delicious, albeit somewhat heavy on mayonnaise. The most notable part of the meal was definitely the wagyu steak, which was succulent and absolutely melted in the mouth. The blackened octopus was not what we expected, as it came in tiny cubes on skewers; dotted with spicy mayo, it was delicious nonetheless.RUKA is no authentic Japanese experience but it knows exactly what it wants to be and it's good at it: a cool place to take a friends or a date and throw back some cocktails, shareable plates, and platter after platter of maki rolls.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"3,"The decor in Ruka is really cool, and they have great cocktails, but the food was nothing to write home about.

My family made reservations here on a Saturday night, and we tried a little bit of everything. It's tapas style with smaller portions, so don't be afraid to be generous with ordering more (unless your bank account says otherwise, of course).I only eat plant-based now, and the vegetarian/vegan-friendly foods I tried include the El Gordo sushi roll (sweet potato, avocado, tofu, cukes), the quinoa salad (sans cheese), and plancha broccoli. El Gordo was good, although I wouldn't call it amazingly exceptional with the high caliber of non-traditional sushi these days. The quinoa salad was well dressed, with a generous amount of roasted Brussels sprouts robust enough to complement the vinaigrette. The plancha broccoli, however, was by far my favorite, with slabs of grilled broccoli scattered with paprika(?)/chili-covered peanuts. The linchpin of all the flavors was the curry sauce, with its hint of coconut that wasn't too overwhelming (as opposed to Thai yellow curry). Absolutely delicious.They're only 5pm onwards, so drop by for a first date, eccentric dinner, casual drinks, or late-night sushi.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,Japanese and Peruvian tapas from sushi to Peruvian street food.Get the wagyu steak it's kind of a korean bbq themed dish (kabob) with butter and wasabi-rocoto salsa pair that with they're newly arrived Peruvian beer.,RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1,"I remember having a good time here the first time I visited Boston, so I decided to come after work for a couple drinks on a Friday night at the bar, now that I live in Boston. I came with a few co-workers and sat at the area near the bar. A waiter came by and everyone ordered a cocktail on the menu. We chatted for 20 min the drink never came. I stood up and found the waiter who took our order to see if he had forgot about us and he simple said the drinks are being worked on. Another 10 min pass I went to front desk asking about those drinks and she said she'll go check on that. Waited another 10 min and went to front desk again to cancel our order. We left and wasted 40 min of my Friday night. What a shame!",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"4,"I still enjoy Ruka however I feel they aren't a FIVE star experience anymore. I went the other night, my first drink wasn't what I ordered but that's fine, it was still good, although too sweet for me. My second drink was also very sweet. What was most disappointing is they used to have this great book of cocktails for their drink menu. It was original and had some great options. They've paired it way back to a single ordinary list of cocktails. Nothing really struck my fancy but since we were already there I tried a couple. I will still go back to Ruka with friends because I enjoy the vibe but won't run there excited about getting an original and tasty cocktail.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,We got lucky finally and snagged a table at the Sushi bar without making a reservation. I love fusion cuisine like this and this place was no exception. Big shoutout to the Wagyu steak and the Lima-style calamari. The Wagyu just melts in your mouth like it should! And the calamari is so unique with its added buttery taste. Will definitely have to come back because there were dishes we weren't able to try this time.,RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Ruka is delicious, it's fun, and it's not cheap - but it's definitely worth it. You walk in and are immediately struck by the space. It's really well decorated and lends to a fun vibe. This would be a good spot for a celebratory night out, so long as you're not looking for something quiet. Our waitress did the thing where we asked for recommendations and she recommended the most expensive thing in each category - we see you. In the end, we ordered on the low side of amount recommended per person and were totally happy. My favorite things we ate: eggplant roll, spicy tuna roll, Japanese fried chicken. The tuna poke wasn't bad, but wasn't particularly memorable either. Speaking of memorable, we got some sort of ice cream sundae with a fish waffle. I'm not seeing the dessert menu online but do not miss this! See the photo. Bruleed banana and everything. Also, cocktails here are great. Highly recommend.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"All the top uncooked fish cultures are represented: Japanese, Peruvian, and Hawaiian.

Maybe that's why I was a tad disappointed with my experience - don't get me wrong - nothing was bad, but I wasn't WOWed! The restaurant is chic and modern and it was packed at 7:30 on a Friday night (reservation recommended!). The menu is tapas style and that range from Maki to fish crudo to pasta and skewers- a real fusion restaurant! My favorite dishes of the night were the Octopus skewers and Wagyu Bavette (also skewers). Both items had the perfect combination of texture and rich flavors. The Scallion Roti with feta dip was also pretty good and had a unique flavor that I've never tasted before.We also tried the Pasta with Chinese Lamb Sausage, Maki with crispy shrimp, and Lamb Belly, which in my opinion were just fine but nothing special. I could probably give a 4 Star to the restaurant judging solely on the food as overall they were pretty tasty. However, the waitress we had was TERRIBLE - not very friendly (no smile whatsoever, and not knowledgeable at all about the menu (when we asked how was the Wagyu Bavette made, all she could tell us was ""they were small pieces of beef"". Duh.. wasn't that obvious and oh, so helpful?!). She was also not there most of the time when we wanted to get another drink or add another dish. Totally not what I expected for service from a restaurant like this.

Ruka is near the Boston Opera House, Emerson Paramount, Boston Common, and Downtown Crossing so you will have plenty to see and do nearby. This was our 2nd visit to the restaurant and they didn't disappoint. We had a reservation for 3 and even though we arrived a little early we were seated right away. We started with cocktails and a mocktail for my little cousin. The menu is comprised of shareable plates sort of like tapas but a little bigger in portion size. We started with the Tuna Poke and two orders of the Blackened Octopus (yes they are that good). The next couple of dishes that came out were the Chao Shou Pork Wontons (sans dairy), the Crispy Lamb Belly Katsu, and the Japanese Fried Chicken. The Japanese Fried Chicken does contain dairy so I decided to eat it along with some Lactaid pills. Any pain I may have had from dairy was beyond worth it! The Japanese Fried Chicken was the best dish of the night (it also happens to be a new addition to the menu). The textures and flavors hit on all notes and leave you completely satisfied. Our final savory dish was the Chicken Fried Rice which was also very good.Apparently we weren't full enough and we decided to be gluttons. We ended up ordering 3 desserts. I brought the Lactaid pills with me especially for dessert. The fried dough bites (I can't remember the exact name) are amazing. They are warm, soft, and the perfect amount of sweet. The other two desserts were a big hit although I didn't try them so I can't speak to specifics.The one issue I have with Ruka Restobar is really just a personal preference. I am a fast eater normally so I wish the dishes would come to the table a little slower and give us more time to relax.

Â We tend to get a taco combination platter with beef tongue (lengua) and carnitas, and then try a few other things. The tortillas have a very nice corn flavor and dense texture. We also recently really enjoyed the Jalisco's quesadilla. Value is pretty good.Honestly, though, some dishes can be hit or miss. Sometimes the carnitas are deliciously tender but sometimes dry, res is somewhat underflavored, some things don't taste as ""just made"" as is possible (maybe better when there's more turnover instead of a weeknight?).But it's not enough to really weigh down the really good elements.

Let's talk about the food! Their chimichanga is bar none the best I have ever tried! I'm not sure what they're wrapping those fresh ingredients in, but it is flaky, light and delectable!! Any meat I have ever enjoyed here has been so tender it is unbelievable! They bring the term 'melt in your mouth' to the next level. Lastly, their flan is homemade in-house. Delicate, caramelized, flavor filled perfection!! Doing a pick up at Boston Logan? Stop here!!",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"4,My favorite local spot for casual Mexican food! Â The setting is casual with table service. Â The chips and salsa are a must- if you're lucky the chips will come warm. Â The chip salsa has a pleasant sweet spicy taste.I ordered the carnitas burrito grande. Â The carnitas were flavorful and moist. Â My bf got a chicken fajita burrito which was amazing. The best part was the selection of fresh salsas- the avocado salsa was great. Will return!,Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,"Really great food! I've ordered takeout from here a few times and everything has been great. So far my favorite thing to get is the tinga tostada, but the steak and chicken tacos are good, as well as the carne asada. The tamales are pretty good, although I think they could use more meat and less masa. The salsa verde is amazing!",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,"I'm a SoCal native and Boston transplant. My mom is Mexican. All I'm saying is, I crave Mexican food often and in large quantities. I originally came to Taqueria Jalisco on a recommendation and have been back one other time since. The food is delicious, affordable, and authentic. I've gotten both the carnitas and the birria, and boy, did they satisfy my cravings. I even had leftovers from my carnitas plate! For what it's worth, I wholeheartedly recommend Taqueria Jalisco!",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,"Eating 4.7 or 4.8Price: tacos were 2.50 each which was a great deal and had plenty of protein. Pozole soup was 9.50 if I recall correctly. I got a small but it was a big bowl. I was full after my meal and would gladly pay the price again for the food. Good deal and great taste.Tacos: Lengua- I bought 4 tacos. 2 lengua (beef tongue) and 2 carne asada. The lengua was really good. Beef tongue may sound gross to you but if you like pot roast then you'll like this. I topped mine off with the green salsa and the chipotle salsa. Both were excellent. The salsas has body and wasn't watered down with water to increase volumes I appreciated that. Â The tart and the slight heat made the tacos even better. Even on its own with just like squeezed on it was still one of the best lengua tacos I've ever had.Carne Asada- the carne Asada I had here was okay in my book. I think I'm used to a different kind. This carne Asada was kinda chopped up and wasn't ""juicy"" or didn't have much ""chew"" to it. Like it wasn't as steak like as other ones I've had in the past. Also there was no char on these. Pozole/soup: Â I've never had pozole before but I've seen it on tv. It was between this and the menudo. I'm not big into organ meats so I opted out of menudo. Pozole was light and it came out with a plate of cabbage, raw onions, oregano, and crisp tortilla discs (didn't taste like a corn tortilla). Â You season according to your preference.The broth itself was light and refreshing, sour and herbal with the oregano and lime. I like the soup and can see how it's comforting on a cold day. The soup itself contained cubes of pork and to my surprise a piece of pork leg. Â Chips: there were tortilla chips that came with before the food with homemade salsa. The chips were a five in my opinion and I usually homemade. Â The masa used to make these chips tasted different, not like the typical ones you get at Tex mex restaurants. Â Hard to describe unless you go there and try for yourself. Tomato Salsa has less heat but had a sweet taste to it. I liked it.Service: great service and the cashier/owner was very nice and friendly.Definitely will be coming back if and when I'm in Boston again.If you like tacos and Mexican food come here. I think this is the most authentic Mexican food I've ever had.",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,Food is always fresh and well made. Â Authentic Mexican dishes. Â The portions are generous; can't really say anything badabout this great restaurant.,Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,"Taqueria Jalisco is the best taco place in all of the Boston area. And it's so affordable! We love the lengua, cabeza, and steak tacos. They have awesome nachos- they make sure each nacho has all toppings on it instead of just being a plain chip. Their birria soup is amazing too. All around an awesome place!",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,"I am in love with this place. I've been to Mexico twice and plan to go back many more times, in large part because of the food there. This place took me there on a cold December night. There are five tables and four counter seats. The servers were so friendly and attentive. Mexican music in the background and wonderfully authentic decor. It felt like the time I stayed in Playa del Carmen by myself and strolled into local food joints I picked on some appetizers. The Sope is so yummy. I've never had one, but it's a thick, masa tortilla that is fried until crispy and puffy. I had mine topped with chicken tinga (pulled with chipotle and onions etc. GET ON IT if you don't know tinga), lettuce, cheese, and perhaps a white sauce. Delicious with wonderful textures. Then came the tostada de camaron - oh. man. (Ay cabrÃ_n!). Perfection. It was like a shrimp ceviche on a crispy tortilla. It had a sweetness to it with wonderful textures and freshness. Lastly, the Jalisco quesadilla, more like an empanada topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese and sauce. Clearly everything here is VERY fresh and made with authentic, Mexican love. Don't miss this place.",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"4,"Mexican comfort food. If you are craving authentic and simple food then look no further than East Boston. I recommend that you come on the weekends, so that you can order one of their special weekend soups. The pork pozole was comfort in a bowl. I also enjoyed their birria and lengua tacos. The lengua in particular had a great flavor. The chicken tamal wasn't bad. The mole enchiladas were very satisfying. Service was extremely friendly. Worth the trip out East. Get an horchata on the side.",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,"Absolutely hands down a great Mexican restaurant! I had their lengua, cabeza,and carne asada tacos, as well as their Jalisco quesadilla, which were all very tasty and full of flavor. Ive been looking for good tacos ever since I moved to Boston from San diego, and this is about as close as it gets! The complimentary chips/salsa are very nice!! Tge salsa has a sweet hint to it while being mildly spicy and just hands down bursting with flavor! The Jalisco quesadilla is to die for, and lengua/cabeza tacos were almost melt in your mouth! Everything has a homemade taste to it because its fresh! The tortillas were nice and warm and taste very fresh.The service was great! The owner was very friendly and stayed open for my friend and me while we finished our food after a long shift at the airport. All in all, I had a great experience here and I will most definitely be ordering from here again!",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"4,"Quick tip: a place called ""Taqueria Jalisco"" already has a high likelihood of being pretty darn good.This is the closest to San Antonio-style tacos that we've been able to find in Boston. I'm not a HUGE fan of Mexican food, but absence makes the heart grow fonder, as they say, and this restaurant was a pleasant surprise for this homesick Texan! Call me a purist, but I love that the tacos are so simple and served with onions and cilantro, and they don't load them up with other crap that doesn't belong in a taco. The service is great, and the ladies that work there are super nice and attentive. I'm only docking a star because the salsa could be better. It's not bad, just not the best I've ever had. I'll leave you with another tip: order a Mexican Coke to wash it all down, and grab a couple of Mexican candies when you're checking out!",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,Tiny restaurant with an authentic flavor. Service is amazing and pricing too. My favorite Mexican so far.,Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,"My husband and I have been trying a lot of places around East Boston and so far Taqueira Jalisco has been our favorite! The staff that works there was really friendly, the food was incredibly, and the portions were insane! The amount of food we got for the price we paid reminded me of being back in the south! I can't say enough good things about this place and I fully intend on returning here as often as possible!",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"5,"TLDR: Phenomenal happy hour, can't comment on much else.Came for their weekday happy hour (4-6pm) which has $6 apps including highlights such as beef carpaccio, and the best damn tator tots I've ever had in my life. Â Note that the happy hour is bar service only. Â The bartender was very friendly and able to recommend me one of their signature drinks (Stella 75) when I wanted something similar to a gin and tonic. Â The drink was light, refreshing, and perfectly suited. Â The inside is a very trendy and clean white decor. Â I'll update the review if I come in for dinner.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"A solid neighborhood bistro that's perfect for happy hour when apps are priced at only $6 each. Make a smorgasbord out of their beets, arancini, tater tots, or small salads alongside a drink or two and you've already got a nice meal.Moreover, the ambience is calm and casual at the bar, where the bartenders are on point, and there's more seating inside the venue. A great neighborhood go-to and one worth visiting even from further afield.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"I absolutely loved Stella, and came here on a Saturday night with a reservation. I felt that the ambiance was pleasant, the service attentive, the food delicious, and the drink selection large.Both in our party got a glass of rose, we split the arugula salad, one of us got the spaghetti in olive oil and garlic and the other the seafood risotto. Everything was spot-on and we thoroughly enjoyed.Having gone to Sportello the night prior, I enjoyed this much more and love that I live in the neighborhood and can consider this a staple.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Food was great and Ovi, our waiter, was very kind with great recommendations for Boston. Â Thanks!",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,Stella never disappoints. Have been here many times and recently for a large group reservation. The service and food are outstanding. Their Bolognese sauce and chicken piccata in particular. The Caesar salad is enough to split for two. And the tiramisu is extremely light and melts in your mouth. You can't go wrong here.,Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"This place is fabulous - I went here when I was in town for business and I'm so glad I came. I sat at the bar for $6 apps during happy hour and everything was delicious! I got the fried artichokes and a half order of pasta (love that they can do half orders) and it was perfect. The bartender was super friendly and even though I was a lone diner, she treated me like I was her good friend :) I would certainly come here again and I highly recommend!",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,They made some changes to the menu (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars) but thankfully they're accommodating for patrons who have have been coming here for years. Service and food is still wonderful.,Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Dropped by for dinner with no reservations and was able to get outdoor seating. Good food, good location and parking wasnt hard to find but our waitress wasn't too attentive. Overall it was good dining.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"The risotto is a little salty, the boyfriend praised the beef short rib very delicious, the mashed potatoes and grilled cauliflower are very delicious, the dessert is very general, not good, the environment and the service are very good, I like it very much.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"After researching online for good Italian restaurants near Washington and Massachusetts streets in Boston, this nice restaurant came up with 4 stars. Stella was a great find and easy to walk to, weather permitting. We were nicely greeted and quickly seated. After perusing the pics online, we decided to get the Parmesan Arancini for an app and the tagliatelle bolognese. We also sampled a libation named Nefertiti, made with peach purÃ©e, vodka, Â tumeric, lemon and simple syrup, very delicious. Both dishes were great, we love Italian food in Boston. We will come back here again and let our friends know about this gem.2017 review #14",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"There is a reason I keep coming back....-Their cocktail list includes everything you could imagine.-They bring you bread right away that is to die for.-They have a big Gluten Free menu and a huge variety for vegetarians. -Atmosphere is enjoyable.-FOOOD - I've gotten the caesar salad, the grilled artichoke pizza with pesto, arugala, and carmelized onion AND I've gotten the spaghetti with olive oil and toasted garlic. EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS PERFECT!-I highly suggest half portions for the pastas - still enough and half the price (woo)!Easy to make reservations or sit at the bar...you just can't go wrong.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"3,"Stella offers a $6 appetizer Happy Hour menu at their bar weeknights from 4-6pm.I popped in there late one afternoon and made myself comfy at the bar. Â Both the dinner menu and the Happy Hour menu were handed to me for my perusal. Â I felt a bit piggish when I selected 3 of the items off the $6 menu, but I somehow managed to consume it all! Â (Although admittedly two of the dishes were rather on the light side.)Parmesan Tater Tots / Spicy Truffle Aioli (not found on the regular menu)Light crisp shell with tender potato shreds within. Â These were quite enjoyable, but so small, it was hard to justify them being a dollar each.Beef Carpaccio / Pickled Shallots / Lemon Aioli / Parmesan / Baby Croutons (reg $13)Yummy carpaccio! Â So thin though, this was a very light dish. Â With the scattering of baby croutons, crostini were deemed an unnecessary component by the kitchen, I guess. Â But I prefer my slices of raw meat on toast, which they kindly provided upon inquiry.Parmesan Arancini / Buffalo Mozzarella / Spicy Pomodoro Fondue (reg $13)About the size of ping pong balls, I felt the rice balls to be rather mushy. Â But maybe they just aren't my thing?My water glass was not tended to till I finished it and motioned towards the empty vessel, but that was basically the only nick in service.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"3,"Sat outside on the patio last night, a Monday night, not busy at all. Â Waitress not knowledgeable regarding food. Â She also disappeared for quite awhile a few times when we wanted something.

Â We will try a different restaurant for our next special occasion!",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"There's really no worse, or lower human being than an elite Yelper. They're universally loathed by chefs everywhere. They are the very picture of entitled, negative energy. They're bad for chefs, they're bad for restaurants.

We split the salmon special of the day and the homemade gnocchi--INCREDIBLE. The sauce on the gnocchi was very unique and soo good. Great service too.

I like the neighborhood, I like the bar, the menu has not changed at all in years and is just so so. It's busy and popular with the after work crowd. I like it for drinks and apps, that's about it.

Very chill atmosphere with a good wait staff. I ate here on a Tuesday night so the dining room wasn't too busy --- so service was extremely fast.The menu was very creative --- both food as well as the cocktail menu.

Would come here again definitely.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1,"One of the worst quality Italian restaurants I've ever been to. Extremely below par. Butter used in such excess it congealed on my plate. No flavor, no taste. Our wine came with debris floating in it. 100$ bill for some of the worst quality food I've ever had. Very unfortunate considering such good reviews. Decor is cheap and I should have known the food would be the same...",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Best Hot Pot in Boston!Honestly, there are two key elements to a good hot pot meal : the meat and the broth. Veggies? Not much in my game. The meat quality at Q is much better than any other hot pot places around (and i've been to many). I've tried most of their meats and each has tremendous marble and thats what I look for when it comes to good quality beef. The meat alone secures a great hot pot experience. Then it comes the broth. Unlike other hot pot places where most of the broth choices are just either bland or merely salty, each of Q's broths is prepared with great flavor. And you can taste the ingredients and work they put in the broth. All broths are good here but I love the tomato broth and crazy mala broth most. I normally order half and half. You get the deep tomato flavor with strong aroma from other chinese spices from the tomato broth, and you also get the exciting, spicy, numbing flavor from the crazy mala broth. Nothing tops that.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"3,"We came here based on the positive reviews, and while the service was amazing, the food was not. The appetizers (fried veggie rolls and shrimp balls) were delicious. For our meals we got a sushi roll (can't remember the name) and my husband ordered the general gau's chicken. About halfway into eating his meal, we noticed a piece a hair wrapped around it. I was sitting across from him and despite me being so far away from his food, I thought it had to be my own hair somehow and just ignored it. But no, it was someone from the kitchen. The second time hair appeared in his food again, I took a picture. Gross. I took a look around and no one was wearing hair nets, not even the guys cooking sushi at the bar in the dining room. Won't be back.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"3,"Came here because of all the reviews on yelp. I wish I could try the hot pot but we were too full to start with and wouldn't have been able to finish it and we wanted to try different dishes. The place is quite huge and you automatically feel at zen as you enter. We were quickly seated, as it was quite late, they were quite empty any way. We started off with the scallion pancake. Honestly I didn't like it as much. It was extremely oily and not quite flavorful. We got the sushi/sashami combo which comes with side of miso soup. The soup was extremely delicious which tells me they have amazing broths and their hot pots would have been a good idea. The sushi's are undoubtedly good! You won't be able to stop eating once you start.! Their cocktails were okay. Nothing too exciting. We tried quite a few different ones -dragon lotus, shanghai mule, ginger q tini and manhattan love story. Our server , was definitely friendly and knowledgeable but seemed a bit impatient. I did like the ambience and the food. Quite possible the little issues we had was because it was quite late in the night and they were ready to close. I would still recommend the place. Their menu is enormous and quite a few options to chose from.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Still in love with this place. Everything still stands. I come twice a year for Dine Out Boston for the amazing deal and then some because the food and service is actually pretty good.Surprisingly though, it's a poppin' happy hour spot on Thursdays so ... be prepared to wait. Also, when they're busy, they won't seat you without your full party.Also, the Crazy Mala Broth is no joke people. It's REALLY tasty but even this was pushing my spice limits - the amount of chilis are not just for show.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Came here for dinner before attending a show at a nearby theater. Wait was about half an hour at 6pm on a Saturday. Once seated service was prompt and friendly. Their menu is divided into hot pot, sushi and Chinese dishes. While hot pots are the main attraction we ordered the chicken and broccoli and beef chow fun from the Chinese menu. Both items were good and prices at this restaurant were fair so I would come back if in the area but avoid if short on time due to the high wait time.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"This was amazing. It's been a couple of months so I can't remember exactly what we had but here goes. The hotspot! Wow! We got the veggie one with vegan broth (a couple of the broths are vegan). This is a massive amount of food for 2 people. I think it can easily feed 3-4 hungry people. We got the veggie fried rice on the waiters rec and it was as good as he said it would be. Also a massive portion. It was my 2 year olds birthday, so the manager himself brought her a complimentary chocolate cake with candles and they all sang to her, she loved it!!! Great service, exceedingly knowledgeable staff, modern space, great atmosphere and delicious food. I really don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. Mouth watering while I'm typing. Next time I'm in Boston, I'll come back!Please have some Asian music on next time",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Since our previous designation did not pan out for us, we crossed the street in Boston's happening Chinatown & came to Q's. While we waited for our casual meal of appetizers, we were educated on the world of Hot Pot. I simply 'feed' off being culturally educated while partaking in good Asian food. Our table had its own personal induction cook top, which was a 1st for me to see.

Â We saw some guests using their ladles to drink the broth & to note, there are pre-made Hot Pot selections like the Supreme Seafood. Q's interior was very welcoming with the colorful dÃ©cor, & has a Sushi Bar that also offers individual cook tops. Thank you to our generous & friendly Server David, for not only taking good care of us yet sharing enlightening Hot Pot insight along the way.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"This is no doubt the gem of Chinatown. I'm always hesitant to go because of the long wait but every time I go I am reminded again of why they have a long wait. Their hot pot broths are so flavorful I don't even use the dipping sauces. The wagyu rib eye was so juicy and perfectly fatty it melted right in my mouth. The rest of the hot pot food were all fresh and had a pretty sizable portion. Their Chinese cuisine appetizers are surprisingly good too for a hot pot specialty restaurant. Our waiter was super helpful and patient with our big party and attentive despite how busy they were. Definitely coming back again, maybe earlier on a week day so I don't have to wait as long.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"4,"The aesthetic and service of this restaurant gets an A+ but the food was just meh. I've been to several shabu shabu places and the food here was just okay. Personally, I think if you do hot pot you should go somewhere that is AYCE. We ordered the lunch special. I think this is the way to go because then you're not overpaying for your meal. The bases that we got were flavorful but I wasn't too keen on the taste. We got the Mala and the standard base. You have to pay extra for anything other than the standard base... minus half a star. Then, the soup contents came in. You get a bowl of veggies and your choice of meat. I got the shrimp, nothing spectacular. I did like the inclusion of enoki mushrooms, but you got one broccoli and one tofu piece LAME... minus another half star.Overall, fair place with flavorful soups and decent food. The atmosphere was great, and I do commend the customer service. The manager (I think) personally came over and got our feedback on the meal and service. TL;DR:- Recommend: yes- Service: great- Tips: come for the lunch special",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"4,"This is undoubtedly a happening and trendy spot in the heart of Boston's Chinatown. Ambience is very pleasant and the menu boasts an incredible depth of fusion ranging from hot pot to spicy Sichuan cuisine. My wife and I enjoyed an order of the Mala Spicy Fish that was sautÃ©ed in a tangy sauce with some red chili peppers. The overall flavor was solid but the signature Sichuan spice level went amiss, perhaps due to a lack of Sichuan peppercorns. They charged extra for accompanying steamed rice despite the dish already being a pricey $15. Pricing still wasn't bad all things considered; tasty seafood doesn't come cheap at fancy spots and that's totally understandable. The real blemish was the service lagging visibly due to large crowds on a lively Saturday night and our waitress entirely forgot to bring out an order of General Tso Tofu, which ultimately worked in our favor because our fish entree filled us up well. On the whole, this is a spot worth checking out as long as you're okay with long waiting times, particularly on the weekends.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Getting to the end of the part of the engagement where I'll be in the Chinatown district at lunch time, I'm trying to make the most of the great Oriental food here. Q Restaurant is one of the fancier places here.It looks like the ""go to"" here is the hot pot as each of the tables has a burner and most of the tables had a steaming bowl of soup going. It looked complicated and I probably need a guide before I dive into that. Instead, I chose the sesame chicken. A decent portion of battered and fried chicken bits in a tasty sauce with a dusting of sesame seeds on top. With a few pieces of broccoli and a scoop of rice, a good meal.My dining mate had sushi and said that it was good. I nabbed one piece of the spicy salmon roll.

They have a bar where you can sit and order drinks while you wait. We were seated quickly.Our server helped explain the hot pots on the menu and what people usually order together. When the hot pot arrived he explained to us how long the food cooks for and suggested that we dip the meat in their special soy sauce which made it taste amazing! I would definitely come again!,Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Awesome food, great service, wonderful atmosphere! I love everything about this place. If you are in Boston please stop by!!!!!",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"When I went to Boston, I went to at least 10 different places to eat in a two day period. Don't ask me how I did it or why I did it ( because I love food.), but out of all the places I went this place was hands down absolutely amazing. If I lived in Boston I would probably live in this place. I'd be ordering a hot tub full of hot pot broth so that I could have a half a lifetime supply of the devilishly beautifully spiced broth. Â I'm actually salivating while I'm writing this post. I ordered the Spicy Mala hot pot, and it was absolutely out of this world. Don't be one of those people and get the damn crab ragoons. Just do yourself a favor get a hot pot.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Just got back from lunch here and I know I've reviewed this place before, but I had to write an update. I took my friend her for her first time having hot pot and Q Restaurant did NOT disappoint! Our server Phanna was wonderful! He was attentive and friendly.

Definitely would come back here for lunch sometime!",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"3,"First time going to this restaurant for a birthday celebration last night and wasn't impressed. The place comes off as a high end hot pot vibe place although tiny in size. The wait was a little ridiculous for what it was worth. I placed down my name and waited about an hour before being seated. Although my whole party wasn't there yet, she told me once everyone got there she would be able to seat us right away. Once 3/4 of my party got there, one of my friends had asked if we could be seated since a majority of us were there but the front receptionist said they didn't have a table for us but then proceeded to seat the couple that had walked in 15 mins prior although I waited an hour. The booth the couple were seated at could have definitely fit me and my 3 friends. I got the surf and turf and honestly the quality was comparable to shabu shabu or shabu zen nothing special, but to have waited in line that long for quality just as comparable to shabu shabu was not worth the wait. Not to mention they messed up on our broth requests, we requested for mala and kimchi broth but definitely just got the House broth and kimchi. Summary:Honestly I don't see the hype, I definitely wouldn't go on a weekend. The price was on par for the surf and turf at $21 like shabu shabu/shabu zen, I think I'd stick to those places since it's easier parking and quicker seating with same quality.

Â Their lunch special is generous for your tummy and the bank and it's less crowded. Â In my opinion, they have the best dipping sauce(s) for hot pot in the city. Â I appreciate how they let you 'make it your own' by lining up all the sauce accompaniments. Â You can't make a reservation but you can put yourself on a list - expect to wait on the weekends but it will be worth it.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"3,"It seems they've downgraded.

The soup base is delicious and the service is good",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"4,"A thousand times YES!When my two favorite foods (hot pot + sashimi) are available and both are pretty darn good-I've struck gold.First: Can we take a moment to appreciate the atmosphere? Q Restaurant gets LIT. Upon entering, Q is like any other upscale Asian restaurant. Complete with chandelier, waterfall, mood lights, and full bar. But, what makes them different is how they play full-blown top charts hip hop. It's kind of odd at first, but quickly sets the tone for a fun time. I'm such a fan.Their hot pot selection is pretty good. I love how you can do half/half broth flavors for no additional cost. I highly recommend trying their popular Mala broth. It's a bit spicy, but dangerously good. Their Surf N Turf plate was amazing and it includes slices of very tender lamb. Yum, my mouth is watering just thinking about it now.My boyfriend and I also shared their Sushi Deluxe. The sushi was so vibrant and buttery. There was no fishy after-taste.I've already recommended Q Restaurant to a ton of my friends. This place is worth checking out for any Chinese food/Hot-Pot/Sushi lover out there.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"5,"You can never ever go wrong with this place, ambiance, service and food 5/5.We order the pomodoro spaghetti , scallops and for dessert the berries with white chocolate tart.",Toscano Restaurant,"47 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"3,"I hate to give Toscano only 3 stars, as meals are delicious and waitstaff attentive, however, this last go around-not so wonderful. The other night we met up there with my brother and hisgirlfriend, both professors in their 30's with a prestigious university system out west. After the valet, I met them inside and we took to our table, a nice seating area of about 5 tables in the back near the kitchen. My party was of five, and appetizers were ordered. A bottle of beautiful red Pio Cesere was ordered and decanted to the tune of $250. We all ate, happily caught up, and enjoyed the ambiance and the company. A patron from another table who happened to look bout 80 years old came over to address us for being ""too loud""'. We acknowledged her concern and she went away. I immediately addressed it with the manager. Under no circumstances at any eating establishment do I expect to be addressed in this fashion by another patron. Especially when hosting an intimate party of 5. The manager seemed genuine and said he would address it. It is still unclear to me if he did. Toscano, the acoustics are apparently not as good asyour food. Sorry to say this totally ridiculous episode soured my visit on an otherwise beautiful night.

Do not go to this restaurant if it is your first day in Boston. We just came to Boston and have spent an hour in Common Park after which we decided to look for a restaurant.

Made the reservation through Opentable. Made several changes and they were pleasant each time, even when we showed up sans one guest. Â Place was packed. I ordered a cocktail.The place was loud but the lighting was gorgeous and flattering. I started with a half order of a Caprese salad which had burrata. The burrata was amazing! I'd get this again and I think the half order was enough- two thick slices of tomato, a small ball of burrata, fresh basil and a light dressing of EVOO. I then had a half order of the asparagus special. Three spears was an appropriate amount for me. Another great choice! The asparagus were perfectly cooked, they also gave me a poached egg hiding under the hard cheese slices. Wow and yummy!!!!! For my main I got a half order of the rigatoni. Cooked perfectly a dente! But it was a heavy dish. I finished with the white chocolate blueberry tart per the waiter's suggestion. Good call. The blueberries were big and sweet and ripe. Great meal but ambiance was too loud for good conversation. We all had trouble hearing each other.",Toscano Restaurant,"47 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"Decided to try this Italian place that was recommended by a friend while visiting Boston. The ambience was nice and reminded me of being in Italy. Our party had reservations on a weeknight (Monday) for 8PM. The place was packed and very loud. I'm glad we made reservations earlier in the day. The service started out slow. I felt like I was waiting for a while before our order was placed. When we finally ordered, the waiter was attentive to our needs and provided fresh baked bread. My brother ordered a beer and got the wrong one. The server was nice and replaced it for the right one. We ordered the cheese platter with truffle honey. The truffle honey was absolutely delicious! It was poured all over the cheese, the fresh pears, Â and apples. I ordered the gnocchi. It was one of the best handmade gnocchi dishes I've had. It was made with fresh tomato sauce, melted mozzarella cheese and basil. My husband ordered the T-Bone steak. According to my hubby, it was cooked as ordered and had a nice flavor, juicy and tender. My brother ordered the rigatoni with bolognese blanco. The pasta was al dente' and the sauce had a great meat flavor. All the dishes were cooked to satisfaction. If you are looking for authentic Italian food this is the place to go!",Toscano Restaurant,"47 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"4,"What I ate: Foley smoked salmon, Sirloin tutte pepe, Lemon white chocolate tart ($25 lunch as part of dine out Boston). Also tried: Minestrone soup, Sausage Rigatoni, and TiramisuPros:- The portions are quite large, despite this being a restaurant week item, this place did not skimp out on their portions. - The lemon tart was my favourite because it didn't feel very heavy even after I ate all the appetizer and steak. The citrus was light and refreshing. - The steak wasn't the best I've tried but it was solid, the potatoes were not dry and it was nice having some of the brandy sauce to dip it in. - Location: very nice restaurant ambience in the most beautiful part of Boston ( Beacon Hill) near the Boston common. Cons:- The steak had a bit too much sauce that I was just tasting sauce and less steak. Maybe if the sauce was provided on the side for the customer to pour, it would be better.",Toscano Restaurant,"47 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,This place is the real deal.

Our waiter Vinny and the rest of the wait staff were excellent, very attentive and pleasant. Our food was delicious. My only complaint is I left too full.

Time to walk it off!",Toscano Restaurant,"47 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,It was one of those nights where we craved for desserts only so we decided to order the white chocolate blueberry tart fo to go since we live 5 mins from the bacon hill location.

We started off with 2 pizzas, the Margherita and the Speck. I only had the margherita and it was so delicious. I could tell the ingredients were quality and the crust was crispy, but not burnt. For our entrees, we each got a pasta dish. I went with the linguine pesto. Ever since that dish, I've been craving pesto. Their pesto is A+. Strong basil taste, hint of garlic and parmesan, and made with good quality olive oil. When I went back a second time (because I desperately wanted the pesto pasta again), 3 out of 4 of us got pasta dishes and the last person got pollo Toscano. We all cleaned our plates. Toscano is a delicious restaurant. The only downside is that the dishes are a bit pricer. But in my mind, they are worth it.",Toscano Restaurant,"47 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"One of my favorite restaurants in Boston. I always order their Rigatoni Toscano but sub spaghetti (not a fan of tube-y noodles lol). The sauce is a tomato cream sauce with double smoked bacon and ommmmmgggg it is foodgasmical. I also loveloveLOVE their habanero powder that you can ask for on the side. I know what you're thinking- habanero powder? Wut? But it goes so well with the creamy, smoky, tomato sauce, you just have to try it. My hubby ordered the chicken milanese and it was AWESOME. Literally love everything about this restaurant.

Friendly staff and classy atmosphere.",Toscano Restaurant,"47 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"One of the best Italian meals we've ever had. Our first choice that night had a long wait so we came across the street and gave Toscano a try. I'm glad our first option wasn't available because this was the best meal of the trip.Tables were all reserved, but the bar was available so we sat at the bar where the full menu was available. The bartender took good care of us and we had an enjoyable evening.We started with the Caprese which was delicious. The Burrata was creamy and delicious. The tomatoes and basil were fresh. We also ordered Bruschetta which featured the same ingredients and was delicious with a nice crispy bread.My main entrÃ©e was the Ortolano Risotto. The risotto and vegetables were perfectly prepared. The dish had a great flavor and the perfect amount of seasoning. I enjoyed this dish very much. Of course as usual my husband picked the stand out entrÃ©e. That was the Pappardelle Bolognese Bianco. My husband and I agreed that this was probably the best Bolognese that either of us has had before. It was meaty and delicious. The pasta was nicely prepared as well.For dessert we shared a White Chocolate Blueberry Tart. The tart was buttery and flaky. The white chocolate filling was a nice flavor with the fresh blueberries.I'd definitely recommend this spot if you find yourself in the area and you are looking for great Italian food.",Toscano Restaurant,"47 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"5,"Found this place on Yelp while visiting Boston. I got the lobster trio and my friend got the lobster roll. The crab and lobster rolls were the best! Shrimp was ok.What I love about the way they do their rolls here is that the bread is toasted and buttery, and their seafood is NOT dunked in mayo. I found that a lot of lobster rolls around Boston had a ton of mayo on them and it just tasted like mayo. Yuck. These were fresh tasting, with the seasoning just right, and the perfect size for sampling all 3 flavors.They forgot about my friend's order so hers took a while to come, but they offered her a free drink to apologize. Love it! Would definitely return on another trip to Boston.",Luke's Lobster Downtown Crossing,"290 Washington St Boston, MA 02108"3,"Can't be summer in New England without eating that lobsatah roll. I was feeling it, Â craving it and so I had to have it. After my workout, I headed to Luke's to get my fix. This Luke's location is small so it was packed when I got there. However, I was able to find a seat and ate my food without having to stand. YEAH!The menu is simple and not extensive, which is good and Â had your basic lobster, crab, and shrimp rolls and the few usual suspects of clam chowder and lobster chowder. I ordered the most basic things, the lobster and crab roll with as small clam chowder.The verdict; the lobster and crab rolls tasted good because they were subtly dressed and was kept as pure as possible on its perfectly toasted rolls. The clam chowder was salty for my taste and was more on the watery side. Overall, I wasn't floored and wasn't terribly disappointed. My only rant is it was $40 for those three items and I felt it was expensive. Would I come back, maybe. Definitely come here at least once and give this place a chance.",Luke's Lobster Downtown Crossing,"290 Washington St Boston, MA 02108"4,"An hour in after arriving at Boston's Logan airport, we were craving Lobster and drove straight to Luke's Lobster. I've been to the one in Vegas and found them to be quite delicious so I was really looking forward to this reunion.They're located in downtown Boston's Financial District. We found parking to be a bit of challenge and expensive, similar to LA. Most of parking garages were charging $20, but we were fortunate to find one for $10 and only a few blocks away. Place is really small with probably enough room for about 10-15 people. Most usually order to go.We ordered the lobster roll and small cup of clam chowder. The rolls were served on a buttered, toasted roll, with lemon butter, very little mayo, and seasoning. Aside from the fact these rolls was small and expensive ($18), they put decent amount of lobster. No fillers, just good size chunks of lobster. Getting your seafood locally sourced definitely makes a difference. The flavor and freshness was fantastic. I like that they only put a little mayo, so less calories and doesn't mask flavor of lobster. Surprising, the clam chowder ($6) was good too. Just as good as the first time. The staff here were kind and friendly. The only thing I wish for, is they open one in LA. I know I will be craving them in the near future.",Luke's Lobster Downtown Crossing,"290 Washington St Boston, MA 02108"5,"I'm not a big seafood person but a good lobster roll is hard to pass up.

The lobster itself is sourced from a few of Luke's purveyors clearly marked and updated on the bird in the store. Maine is usually a good bet for fresh, tasty lobster.

As soon as we successfully checked into hotel and put our things in our room, I dragged my boyfriend downstairs, determined to have a lobster roll as my first meal in Boston. We made it 10 minutes before closing time! Cashier was super friendly and said we could take our time eating. We both opted for the LUKE'S TRIO sampler of the 3 half sandwiches. Got our sandwiches rather quickly and we are ready to enjoy! Bread was toasted nicely and all the seafood had a light, creamy dressing. I appreciated that things weren't drenched in mayo. With every bite I could taste the ocean (in a good way!). All the seafood was so fresh and sweet and melted like butter in my mouth.

This shop has interior dining options and no outside dining option. They have barstool seating and some small 2-4 person tables inside. The food was served fast. I loved how crispy the roll was and how fresh the seafood tasted. The lobster had a bit of bay seasoning on top (advertised as their secret seasoning but tasted bay seasoning-like).

The food came out astonishingly fast--for reference, we were in and out in an hour flat, which was impressive. The scallops were nice, although one was extremely fatty and inedible. They came with mushrooms and carrots and a glaze, and the dish was light and enjoyable. The gnocchi were quite good as well. My sangria was extremely strong--I believe they add some type of liquor in it as well as wine.Service was buttoned up--our waiter was efficient and courteous--no more or no less.

Best dinner of the trip. Prosciutto had the perfect balance of sweet and savory (and the balsamic vinegar added a sour kick), tortellino was creamy but the burrata cheese was subtle enough that it wasn't too heavy, lamb had just enough Marsala wine to have that distinct flavor but not too much to be overpowering to the meat, and the pannacotta... light milky flavor plus salted caramel plus candies nuts... can I say ""perfect balance"" another time in this review??",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"4,"As intended by the name of the restaurant, I had dinner with a group of five here before a show at the Boston Opera House. I loved the cozy atmosphere, our waiter's peppy personality, and the fact that you can order half portions of the pasta (which are actually just the right amount of food for dinner if you add a side).My rigatoni bolognese with a side of garlic spinach was delicious, and my friend Molly said the tortellini with burrata and basil was the best she'd ever had. We also had a few lovely glasses of rosÃ©, which our waiter was kind enough to let us photograph.I wish that I could give Teatro 5 stars, but we sat down to dinner at 5:30, and barely made it on time to our 7:30 show just down the street.

Another ten minutes passed before we were given carbon copies to sign.Our growing frustration could have been averted by a little communication upfront; then we would have paid cash and not had to rush to get seated before the curtain. As it is, I'm bummed about this bump in an otherwise excellent dining experience.",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"4,What a great Italian restaurant. Went there for dinner and we made a reservation on open table. We had the octopus ($13) and I highly recommend it. I ordered the linguini ($15) and it was delicious but it was a little bit too al dente. The small portion is enough unless you are really really hungry.,Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"4,"The food here was great, and I loved the atmosphere. It was comfortable, with dim mood lighting, and a somewhat rustic feel. It could be a nice place for a date, but I took away a star for the abysmal service. I don't know if all the servers were having a bad day or what, but I had to put on my jacket halfway through my dinner from the frosty attitudes. Aside from the subpar service, everything else was wonderful.",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Didn't expect such high caliber food in the theatre district! Â Fresh and imaginative dishes -of course home made pasta is wonderful. I had the scallops which I can't say enough about. The layers of flavors-pea shoots, mushrooms and this amazing lemony parsnip purÃ©e. Heavan! Â Service was excellent as well. Cant give any critique at all.",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"3,"Food was good. Â We ordered the Chicken Milanese, small plate of Linguine with Shrimp, the bolognese, and a tomato pizza.It took a while to get our drinks because the bar was busy...that's what we were told. Â Our food came out rather fast and it was very good. Â The atmosphere was a bit stuffy though and that was our initial impression which forced us to be weary of the place. Â Other than than that...no great shakes.",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"3,"My sister and I ate here before going to the AMC movie theater next door. Â It's a pretty small restaurant with quite a few tables crowded together.I was really looking forward to eating here but was disappointed. Â The meals were very expensive for the size and quality. Â They bring out bread with a dip (hummus I think?) but the bread was bland and the dip wasn't good. I enjoyed the burrata, but it's hard to believe that it's a serving for two people - you only get one piece of bread with it. We were shocked when we saw the beet salad (we didn't end up ordering it), but it was tiny and consisted of 4 pieces of beet with some garnish. Â My sister and I each ordered a half size of pasta dishes, which turns out are also tiny - the size of your bread plate. Â The gnocchi was made from ricotta so it sounded promising, but it definitely wasn't worth the price. Â The half size of the tortellini comes with TWO tortellini. Â They were very cheesy, good but not great.On the plus side, they have great service. Â Our waters were never empty and everyone was very attentive.I won't be coming back here. Â If you want Italian food, you're much better off in the North End where you actually get what you're paying for.",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"4,"A high-end Italian restaurant located just across the street from Boston Common on Tremont and just around the corner from the Opera House.We chose this spot for dinner before attending a Broadway musical at the opera house in large part due to its location. Â We were even more pleased by the outstanding service and fresh inventive menu and beautiful setting. Â I'd go back even if I weren't trying to go to the theatre.We arrived a bit early and were shown to a cozy corner table in the back of the restaurant where we could dine side by side-our favorite type of table. Â One of the nice things about the restaurant is the very large selection of quality wines by the glass. Â Like their sister restaurant Ostra, service was solid with water glasses kept full and fresh plates and silverware after each course. We enjoyed the fresh buratta with toasted bread and blistered tomatoes as a first course then we each chose a pasta-me the lobster and my wife the sausage orricetti-both outstanding. Â For desert, a mouse-like whipped chocolate that was light and tasty. A nice touch is the ability to order the pastas in either first course or entree sizes. Â In our case,?the first course sizes were plenty.Highly recommended for its service, flavor and hospitality.",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Went to Teatro on a Friday night for a friend's birthday.. the place was packed (tables were a bit too close with one another)!!! The menu offers a good selection of appetizers, pasta dishes, and a few entrees choices. I went with the foie gras meatballs and the Scallops. The meatballs were among the best I've ever had! They were super tender, well seasoned, and just melt in your mouth! I thought the scallop dish was just ok.. I liked the concept - the scallops were served with some roasted brussel sprouts, some fancy mushroom, butternut squash purÃ©e and a couple slices of prosciutto.. all sounds really good! However, the scallops themselves were not particularly large, fresh, or sweet and I've definitely had much better ones else where.Other people in my party seemed to all enjoyed their food very much - a few of them ordered the ""red meat"" (yes, that's the name of the dish on the menu), which is a HUGE ribeye. It looks really good and i think it's more than reasonable to be charged only $25 for it!There were a couple more items on the menu that I wanted to try, especially some of the pasta dish! Will be back soon :)",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"5,I really liked that place ! The food was great and the service was impeccable!! I would definitely come back there to have a nice dinner !,Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"4,"My squash tortellini was great as was my boyfriend's spaghetti carbonara. The portions weren't huge, but I was still full.Prices are a bit hefty, but service is very quick. Not a place for a drawn out meal, but the food is awesome!!!",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Teatro is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. Â It has a cozy feel to it, since it is just one dining room with tables close together, Â but that's how it is in Italy! It looks as though the restaurant is going through some cosmetic adjustments. The ceiling has been painted and there are now two huge, but beautiful chandeliers in the center of the dining room. Â The room may change, but the food is still remarkable. Â I brought my family before a movie one night and my mom could not stop raving about the mussels and the duck polenta. Â Since they have small dishes of pasta we got 4, the Gnocci, Orecchetti, Bolonese, and the linguini for everyone to taste and share. Lastly, Â we got the Prosciutto pizza and the Eggplant Rollitini. Our server, Â Kate, timed or meal perfectly and we didn't feel rushed with three courses. Â We also had time for a quick cappuccino pick me up before the show. My family loved every bite and it made for one memorable evening.",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"4,"I ordered the scallop dinner and I thought it was great. My husband had a pasta dish and thought the homemade pasta was cooked perfect and it was a tasty dish. The main entrees coupled with the good service is the reason for the 4 star rating. We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and they were just okay, I was hoping for a little more flavor and I wouldn't order them again.",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Cool place in the heart of Boston!Definitely has the upscale vibe tied to it, so it's not a bad idea to dress up a tad bit! (Jeans + blazer look) My friend and I came here on a week night and ordered some exceptional pasta plates. The best part is that you can choose what portion you want. Small portions are the size of a bread plate, and the full options are dinner-sized. For starters, we were offered hummus and olive oil with delicious bread. We proceeded to have the Ravioli and Shrimp Linguini prior to dessert. All in all, a great location to come to for a quiet dinner!",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Dinner at Teatro was the perfect way to start out our long weekend in Boston! The wine selection is top notch and the vegetable appetizer platter was a great way to start the meal--with plenty of bread on the side. I ordered the half order of shrimp linguine (comes in a half and full order), which was flavorful and surprisingly very filling. I also tried some of the mushroom risotto, which was some of the best risotto I have ever had, at any restaurant. For dessert, our group split a few orders of the chocolate cake and berry panna cotta. The panna cotta was one of the best-prepared desserts I've had in a long time--the fruit was fresh and the texture was perfect. Looking forward to returning to Boston so we can come back to Teatro!",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"5,"I have been here so many times, I lost count. Whenever we have out of town guests, this is where we take them. The food is amazing. We always start with the antipasti platter and truffle fries. They used to have this amazing flank steak but replaced it, I've tried both and both are fantastic! Our favorite pastas are the bolognese and lobster shells. Â The panacotta and espressos are a great way to go",Teatro,"177 Tremont St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Favorite italian restaurant in boston. This place has amazing appetizers and entrees. I recommend any of their pastas, beef carpaccio, and tiramisu. I've tried one of their other desserts, which was some sort of pear soaked in wine, but if you like sweet dessert, I would recommend the tiramisu. Or, head down the street for some famous cannolis. The interior is cozy, but quite upscale. The service is always spectacular, all the servers are attentive throughout the meal, and explain all of the dishes professionally. The restaurant itself is quite small, so I would recommend making a reservation in advance. Also, to my knowledge, they had a corkage fee of $30-35 if you bring your own wine bottle.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"4,"So...Incredible foodIncredibly authentic ambianceOysters Rockefeller were amazing Meatballs were amazing Our four entrees were great, including my classic Bolognese (my go-to test of any Italian restaurant)Our three desserts were amazing and perfectThey lose a star because of their GROSSLY overpriced wine list. Â  I know my wines, I know prices, and these were exorbitant. Â  When you drop a car payment on wine you expect quality, and the value simply wasn't here. Â  If they unilaterally lowered their alcohol prices to more consistent and reasonable levels they would be 5 stars.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"3,"First off, I want to sing the praises of the staff, here. Our waiter and all support staff were amazing and attentive, there were longer gaps in service as we were almost done but our server had a large group and was still acceptably attentive. The food was good but price to portion ratio was off, Imo. I could have easily eaten another entree, I'm not a large person. The cheese appetizer was small. The portions were just small all around. My Disarrono Sour was exceptional, it was fresh and tangy, best I've ever had! I had the Rabbit entree and my husband had the Beef entree. Both were great, just small. I ordered 2 desserts after they brought us one on the House (it was our anniversary) and the peach tart is TO DIE FOR! Freshly baked to order. Now, my reason for 3 stars, we asked for the most private table possible, which I think is impossible at this restaurant because it is so ridiculously cramped. The other tables were so close I proximity to us, there is legitimately no privacy, at all. The servers make do with Space but it is really cramped. We had to push our table back so my husband wasn't getting bumped by the staff. The decor was cute and it felt kind of like eating at my nonni's, just too cramped. All in all, it was a nice restaurant but we probably won't return because we left hungry after spending 190$.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"What a gem! Â The atmosphere is amazing. They had me at pesto... Â From being seated and paying for our meal, it was a pleasure eating here. We sat upstairs overlooking the street. Lovely restaurant and delicious food. I even overheard the waiter accommodating some young children making sure they could serve them something they would enjoy. Glad we came.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"Busy restaurant, even during weekdays, definitely make a reservation before you go. Â At least there is a nice seating area for waiting customer. The waiting staff is friendly and attentive.The food lives up to the hype. The menu changes every day but they have a few that says everyday such as boglonese. I ordered the boglognese past and lobster pasta. The boglognese was good but the lobster pasta was divine. It has delicious mushroom and fish roe on top, which adds so much texture to the pasta. All the pasta are fresh and has wonderful texture.The place is a little cramped but so are many North End restaurants. Street parking is hard as always. But the food is worth it.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"4,"We came here for Valentine's Day dinner and this place as so cute. We had a table upstairs by the windows overlooking the square... and so quaint! The menu for that day was the prix fixe menu, and that was fine because it was still a large selection and it included all of their popular items. I got a lobster pasta as an app, the osso busco as the entree and the tiramisu as dessert. The lobster pasta was good... the lobster was fresh and it was a lot of lobster for an app. I've never had osso busco before and for my first experience it was pretty good. The veal was super tender and the risotto was nicely flavored as well. The tiramisu was alright, it was good for sure, but it was not the best I've had.All in all, I would come back here again just for the setting. Plus you can't Â go wrong with the food!",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1,You have to be prepared to eat on their terms. Me I was way different than what they advertised. Ridiculously over priced!!,Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"Crazy good food and service.We had Rafael as a waiter and Tom at the Bar and they were super. The restaurant itself was more upscale than I thought it would be - after a day of touring we weren't exactly dressed for the occasion but they still were very nice to us.The menu changes daily I guess with fresh ingredients and different in season stuff.I really enjoyed the Ossobuco - tender and well seasoned. We liked the cheese and salami appetizers and wine list was fantastic with great Italian wines. Wish we had dressed a little nicer, but we had a fantastic evening and loved the quaint location and restaurant.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"Wow wow wow! One of the top ten meals I've had. Located in quiet North Square, just a block away from bustling Hanover Street, Mamma Maria's is just where you want to be on a cold winter day in Boston. Super cozy when you get inside. We were seated upstairs overlooking North Square. From the service to the food, everything was impeccable. Do yourself a a favor and get off Hanover Street and come here.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"4,"Amazing service. My husband got some pasta sauce on his white shirt and someone saw and brought him club soda and a fresh napkin to clean it off right away without us asking. Food was pretty good, great location.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"2,"Go ahead and pass on this place. Nothing special, service was mediocre to match the food. My husband and I came a little after 5pm, we didn't have reservations so we came early assuming they'd have tables. They said they'd fit us in, then led us through an empty restaurant and sat us at the small bar where the bartender served us.We were excited to try the uni pasta...but they were out. We had the veal carpaccio, and lobster ravioli instead. After we ordered we sat and listened as the bartender and a server loudly discussed how much they did not want to be there working and serving that day. Hmm...lovely. Veal carpaccio, we may as well have eaten paper. It was that bland and boring. Lobster ravioli was over cooked and needed more sauce. Waste of a meal.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"Oh Mamma Maria how I love thee!Last Friday evening I had the joy of celebrating my birthday at Mamma Maria's with my parents and girlfriends from high school. Nestled in a square away from the hustle and bustle of Hanover Street, Mama Marias is perhaps one of the most charming restaurants I've ever visited. Upon entering the establishment, we were greeted by a host who told us that we had the best table in the restaurant... he wasn't kidding. We were led to a tiny room upstairs with a single table inside that overlooked Paul Revere's house. Since my dad has trouble hearing this was absolutely the perfect atmosphere conducive to great conversation. To start we ordered a round of Harvest Salads for the table which came with baby red spinach mix, sliced pear, toasted almonds, fresh tarragon and goat cheese. We also enjoyed a basket of complimentary bread that came with some house made pesto and olives that totally hit the spot.To eat, we ordered a variety of dishes including the Halibut (absolutely DELICIOUS and not to be missed!), the Chicken, Osso Buco (tremendous) and the Frutti di Mare Pasta. We all raved about our dishes and found the portion sizes to be absolutely perfect. To end the night we enjoyed a complimentary Tiramisu with a birthday candle. All in all, Mamma Maria proved itself the perfect place to celebrate my special occasion and is a restaurant that I look forward to visiting for years to come!",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"4,"So I finally dined here. 'Twas a Sunday night in the North End and my friends wanted to have a hearty family Italian dinner. Everything was packed but Mama Maria was able to make it happen (thank you to the male host and NOT the female one who is always so rude.)Our server was funny and down to earth. We placed our orders (cheese appetizer, osso bucco, rabbit, pork, and lobster pasta) and waited for our food to arrive.All the food had great flavor but the standout was the lobster pasta. Trust me, get it! The rabbit was a runner up.Overall a great dinner. Not much different than other places in the North End in regard to flavor, but if you're looking for something fancy I can recommend Mamma Maria's. When they're not being temperamental of course!",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"3,"The restaurant is beautiful, and well decorated. I had a reservation and still had to wait 10 minutes. Our server seemed as though he was rushing and was impatient, but it was a Sunday evening after all. I ordered the skirt steak, and it was good. Others in my party ordered the rabbit pasta dish and the lobster ravioli dish (completely forgot the names!) and they didn't seem pleased. This place was very expensive for mediocre food and service. Won't be coming back.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"So I have been going to the North End for 30+ years and each time we go we try and visit another restaurant to change it up. We are the type that does not make reservations and just goes with it. Â I had always heard wonderful things about Mamma Maria so I made reservations. Â We we seated upstairs near the windows and it was just beautiful. Â The atmosphere was amazing, the drinks ( Manhattan) were perfect and dont even get me started on the food! Â  I had the osso bucco and the portion was so large I did not think I would ever be able to finish it. Â Well after taking my first bite I can assure you I ate it all....and dessert! Â Amazing experience from start to finish. Â The waitstaff was outstanding.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"One of our fav places in North End. Food, services and vibes are all incredible. Maybe because the building is like a big house, whenever we come here, we feel like we are invited to a big Italian family dinner.We normally don't do restaurant week menu but this place actually makes efforts to make its restaurant week menu fun. Two years in a row, we did restaurant week course menu, which we enjoyed so much. Their food is always flavorful and creative but not too adventurous, which I like. Their pasta dishes are amazing.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"Outstanding from start to finish! The host was very accommodating when our reservation was inadvertently made on the wrong day (my bad), and we arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday night. Fabulous food, outstanding service! We had the lobster ravioli, long bone veal chop (cooked to perfection), and my favorite cacio e pepe (that was offered to me as an entree portion. That's how much I love it). Oh, don't miss the peach cobbler and tiramisu! The service was impeccable. We will absolutely be back.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"3,"I guess I just don't understand restaurants in the North End that don't have a plethora of pasta listed on their menu. Why are you even located in the North End then? I had an okay experience at Mamma Maria. Yes, it was very fancy. Yes, the service was wonderful and extremely accommodating. We were even given a semi private room for our group to dine in, which was kind of cool. My issue lies with the menu. The prices were very high for what was in my eyes OK food. The food was decent, don't get me wrong. But, it wasn't great-especially not for the kind of prices we were paying. I did like that they offered half bottles of wine though. That was a nice touch. Vegetarians beware that there are not a lot of meal options for you here. I ordered the Mushroom Tortellini, which was yummy but very, very heavy on the butter. In fact, butter was oozing off my tortellini. I won't be back. I just feel like there are so many other delicious restaurant options in the North End where you can get a better bang for your buck.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"I have heard about Mama's for years. Begged my hubby to go for quite some time. Well my hubby surprised me for our anniversary to go to Mama's. I can most definitely say it has become a near and dear favorite for special date night. It has lived up to it's five star reputation. Our service was 5 star, the meals were complements to the chef excellent. I had the Ossobucco, my hubby had the lobster ravioli. Both were mouth watering excellent. I had snagged my hubby's last bite of ravioli it was a very good combination to my Ossobucco. I had Moscato wine which also was very good wine. I'm a picky sweet wine lover. I was impressed. The desserts was Tiramisu and panna cotta with berry glaze. We were so stuffed from dinner that we made room for dessert!Thank you so much for making a memorable night for my hubby and I. Grazie Mille!!! Mrs. Zurhellen",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"4,"For me, the best part of Mamma Maria is the space. Right by the Paul Revere House, Mamma Maria was once a beautiful old home and you'll eat dinner in a smaller room as opposed to a massive dining room. I've eaten both on the second floor and downstairs, and both were great experiences.However, the food is pretty darn good too. It's not a cheap evening, but it's worth a spend to have a romantic evening in a well-refurbished restaurant deep in the North End, off the main drag.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"5,"I visit boston once a year for PAX EAST. All you gamers out there know what that's about :) Anyway, I get blessed with this annual trip and the opportunity to try different lobster rolls. James Hook has stayed at the top of the list year over year. My coworkers I bring always get amazed after their first time and from there, the word of mouth just spreads. Showing some love and recommending their lobster roll because no one else does it better.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"Came by on a rainy day and there was still a line. I got the lobster roll which was $19.99. It was pretty good because they give you a good amount of lobster in the roll, but for some reason the whole thing was lacking some kind of flavor. So in short, PRO: lots of meat and pretty short wait in line. CON: lacks flavor",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,"Amazing lobster roll ($19.99) and double stuffed clam ($8)! I stood in line on a Monday during lunchtime and waited for about 10 minutes, but it's so worth it. I enjoyed my food outside at one of their patio tables. FYI - they have a regular and large lobster roll; I stuck with the regular and was still stuffed - Huge, fresh pieces of lobster. Also, the double stuffed clam was about the size of the palm of my hand and was packed with chunks of clam and stuffing. Large portion sizes with great, fresh flavor for a reasonable price.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"WHAT TO TRY?! The lobster rolls. The seafood. The crab cakes. This place is also another place known for their lobster rolls. The moment you enter the shop, you'll see aquariums with lobsters, big and small, and displays of fresh fish, clams, mussels and shrimp. It's like a small fish shop that serves a lot of seafood!!I didn't see the option for hot lobster rolls so they only have the cold option. The pieces of lobster meat on the roll are hugeee. Even though they only offer the lobster roll in cold option, I thought I enjoyed the roll. Too bad this place doesn't come with a complimentary side of fries or coleslaw though. Each order just comes with a just roll, however they have the option of a regular size or large size of the lobster roll. The rolls would be served on different breads and of course more lobster with the larger size! LAST TIP?! This place only has places to sit outside the shop. Literally a place for people to grab and go. Lots of birds outside for you to feed if you don't end up finishing your roll...they'll be waiting!!",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,"If you get ONE thing here, it's gotta be the lobster roll. I'm usually partial to the hot lobster roll versus cold, but wow, James Hook's lobster roll definitely has me leaning towards the other side. Just wow. The service here is efficient; you'll be in and out in a matter of minutes. As I mentioned, the lobster roll is cold with a mayonnaise base. The roll was heaping with some of the best lobster I've ever tasted in my life; it was sweet as good lobster should be and it definitely tasted very fresh. Quite possibly one of the best things I ate in Boston.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"Stopped in here to get a lobster as advertised on the front of the building that says $8.99 a lb. Great deal!!!! So we walked in and it was $30 for a 1.5 lb. Lobster. Huh? The outside price said $8.99 a pound. The lady at the counter said it was $30 for a 1.5 lb. lobster.So instead we got a cup of clam chowder!! Awesome!!Lots of clams, potatoes. Seasoned very well and very creamy. Would recommend-",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,"AHHH-MAZING! We got here early, around 10:45am, no lines! We had their Clam Chowda and Lobster Rolls. I am by no means a chowda expert, but... this has to be the best New England Clam Chowda we have ever eaten. It was thick, creamy, full of clams! The flavors were absolutely delicious! We even 2 large refrigerated ones to take back with us! The lobster roll was also fantastic! Was stuffed with fresh, sweet lobster meat. No fillers. No lettuce! The way it should be. Lightly tossed in their dressing. Just simple PERFECTION.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"3,"First......***NO BEER***2nd...**Luke's Lobster Roll IS BETTER!!HOWEVER... it's Clean and Good. Lobster roll was kinda plain, drenched w/ mayo, PACKED with lobster. So you can pack your lobster roll, okay.. but you can't beat that bread and flavor at Luke's.Very small inside and tons of extra non sense to buy. Mostly souvenirs and seasonings.If you sit outside, beware...the patio closest to the door is where they wash port a potties so take caution!Get a patio spot FAR from the entrance AND...Just FYI..They DO run out of coleslaw.The potato salad is redskin potato's and again mayo overload it was fair at best. The quality of the seafood is top of the line and you can tell it's very fresh, But just not worth more than the 3-4 star rating. There just isn't much flavor and The whole experience was meh....LUKES though... on the other hand. Which we had yesterday. WOW.Trust me if you have only time to go for one. Go to Luke's. It's mind blowing!",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"This was our first stop (food wise) in Boston. Long line but went quick and was worth the wait! Got two (a regular and large) lobster rolls, one for each of us and a potato salad. The lobster rolls were great, best I've ever had for sure. The potato salad was alright. The seating was limited cause it's small and busy. My main reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.. was the price. Lobster rolls seemed a little higher than just about anywhere else, and potato salad was very expensive too. Spent like $65 on lunch for this food. But.. just based off food alone was great! Go here",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,"This chowder set the spoon really high. Loved the chowder, made tasting other chowders in Boston difficult, as none paralleled. As for the roll, also very good. No skimping on the lobster. James Hook & Co. has indoor seating, as well as a huge patio space, some covered and some not. Along with their merchandise section, they also had coolers inside with things like lobster ravioli, and various foods to take home and cook.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"Super expensive... but it's lobster, what else would you expect? Rolls are yummy, chowder could be better.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,"BEST LOBSTER EVER! I wanted a snack to grab and go so I can have with my drink at the Intercontinental outdoor bar so we walked a few minutes to James Hook. We weren't really hungry so just ordered 1/2 pounds lobster claws and a crab cake. They packed us butter and lemon as well so don't forget to ask for it!. WOW... this was the best lobster I've ever had... I can't even put into words how different and how fresh it tasted from what I'm used to.. it was SOOO soft and tender and really broke apart in my mouth.. unlike lobster that I'm used to back at home where it's pretty tough and chewy. The crab cake was just ok because I wasn't a fan of the outside breading, but the inside was all crab meat! For the price you pay, you will get GREAT lobster. Doesn't even need to be warm or anything! It's perfect the way it is. I wish I bought a pound to bring back home :( I recommend just ordering lobster and nothing else.Tip: If you want a better view with your meal, take it to-go and walk over to the Intercontinental outdoor bar. Grab a drink and eat away with a pretty view :)",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,"WOW, they served me the best lobster roll I have EVER tasted! This is a MUST for anyone living in or visiting Boston!",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,"I really don't think there is a better lobster roll out there! I know when you come to Boston a lobster roll and clam chowder are one of the first things everyone says you need to get-THIS is the place to go! It is a little expensive? Sure. But is it worth it? 100%!! You have to realize that quality, fresh lobster is not cheap. And with lobster rolls, you get what you pay for. James Hook will not disappoint. The lobster roll itself comes piled high with tons of lobster meat and the roll is so soft and buttery. You can order it with butter if you don't prefer mayo, but in my opinion GET THE MAYO. Your taste buds will thank you.Also, a MUST TRY is the clam chowder. Huge chunks of clam and potatoes with a rich creamy broth, it doesn't get much better.If you are visiting Boston for the first time this should be on the top of your to-do list! It's especially beautiful in the summertime because all of the outdoor seating is open and there is plenty of room to sit somewhere!",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"I'm by no means a lobster roll connoisseur but the ones at James Hook are just off the mark from perfect for me. The lobster is extremely fresh and comes in decadent, large, chunks. The meat is sweet and tender and the store makes a point of having the live lobsters in a tank where you can literally watch them getting taken back into the kitchen. The only downside to me was that the roll was off - I expected buttered, soft bread that takes a back seat to the lobster meat but it's served on a large, dry roll that almost feels like it's competing with the lobster for attention. Otherwise, delicious.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,"Best warmed lobster roll! A must try!! Yes, beware they close at 3pm! I wish I would have eaten 2 of these! So good,totally fresh. Did try a few other spots, but this place came recommended by my Uber driver Rocco which shared the history. Apparently it was a restuarant,until it burned down. You can actually see the old place next door. I do hope they rebuild. It truly is a hidden gem. A must try,will go back if I ever return to Boston. Of course,its outdoor patio style,but plenty of seating. Best to walk...fast service. Loved the outdoor patio. There is no price placed on good quality, this place has it nailed down. Thank you for my experience. Wish you could mail FedEx to California! I did see your packaged cooler items. Â Oh,nice lil souvenir shop,candle is great for gifting!",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"3,Very good lobster rolls. However I did not find the staff to be very warm or Â friendly. Maybe they're victims of their own success ? Who knows....I had the large lobster roll and i think the price was extremely reasonable. It tasted so fresh and decadent and there was definitely plenty of lobster meat for the price paid. Overall a great lunch!,James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"Real big clumps of lobster on the roll. Toasted nicely and drench in butter. Just wished it could've been seasoned a little better. The lobster bisque is a must!!!! And... for the double stuff crab cake, it's a no for me.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"5,Finally it back here after a day of intensely hiking the terrain of Spectacle Island. Practically crawled back to the city in search of my most beloved Boston treat: the James Hook lobster roll. What sort of magical bread is this thing made with by the way? They give a very generous helping of lobster as well. Tasted even better as we enjoyed them in the ample outside seating. Service was fast and friendly. I will be back again....and again.,James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"All I can say is that everything here is super fresh. I tried the lobster roll which was AMAZINGGGG, but I was a little disappointed by my Mac'n cheese. I'm more for the traditional Mac n cheese shape of pasta and I feel like the sauce was not cheesy at all..it was very ""liquid"".",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"4,"When you are staying at The Liberty Hotel and it's raining outside, and you need a place to eat dinner - then this place is your best bet. Just call for reservations and get seated immediately upon arrival. We had a booth to ourselves, and ordered some delicious entrees:1) scottish salmon w/ curried new potato puree, favas & roasted chicken gastric $362) chilean sea bass .. miso glazed, golden potato gnocchi w/ japanese seaweed pesto $393) spaghetti vongole (with clams) $19 - I had this dish; was delightful and just the right size; they had at least 10 clams in there. If you like seafood/clams, then get this!",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel2,"It's difficult to convey my extreme disappointment with Scampo because, while I was very excited to celebrate my engagement at such a highly touted restaurant, almost nothing met my expectations. I did not enjoy the food, the service was lackluster at best, and the ambience was rowdy. I felt like I paid upscale prices for complete mediocrity. Our table of 6 ordered the prime rib ($48), tajarin pasta ($32), pork chop ($38), pappardelle pasta ($31), lemon risotto ($25), and salmon ($35). I personally tasted the risotto and salmon.I'll start by saying that I have never been so at odds with a dish as when I first tasted the risotto. Though I liked that it was cooked well, the taste and smell was completely nauseating; every bite of it tasted like gorgonzola cheese and literally no other flavor was present. The soft shell crab was great, but the main portion of the dish was virtually inedible. I had to switch plates with my fiancÃ©e, and fortunately she was more understanding than I. The salmon, while certainly more edible and actually very decent, was over cooked. The skin was crispy, however, and the mashed potatoes and lima bean accompaniment were tasty. Still, the fish was leagues better than the risotto. I truly cannot wrap my mind around it, and everyone at the table agreed.The pappardelle pasta was serviceable and came with lamb in a meaty sauce. I'm told that it was okay -- nothing amazing, but definitely not bad. I also heard great things about the porkchop so I would recommend that. The prime rib also received very solid feedback.All in all I was severely disappointed in the evening. Service was generally very poor -- we saw the waitress maybe three times throughout the meal, and in intervals of what felt like twenty minutes. The gentleman refilling our waters was much more on time than our waitress. I can't recommend this restaurant in good conscience, and I wish I had chosen another venue to celebrate a special occasion.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel4,"A great place to have dinner when you have guests from out of town! Not only because of its prime location inside the historical Liberty Hotel, but also because of its decent food and ambiance. Be sure to make a reservation if you come in a large group.The menu was primarily classic Italian dish. To start off, we opted in for the calamari and the prosciutto mozarella to share. For entree, I had the chilean sea bass which was delicious but not outstandingly special. We also shared the Friday night special at that time which was the suckling pig al forno - huge portion but found the meat to be a bit dry. My friend also tried the shortrib and it was decent. Great experience overall, and would come back next time we take guests for dinner!",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel4,"Great Italian restaurant located on the street level at the Liberty Hotel. Â Great vibe that matches the hotelTo insure that you get seated, make reservations or call ahead, especially on a Wednesday or Thursday evening. Â High tables, seating at the bar or Chef area and formal tables are all available. Good luck in deciding on one appetizer to start your meal. Choose from calamari, charcuterie, Pizza flatbreads (most popular). The Buratta cheese dish is amazing!Dinner choices are also tough to decide on. Homemade pasta, fish and beef dishes. I had the 7 ounce sirloin steak and asked for a side of sweet potato. It was cooked perfectly. Full liquor menu available. Â Wine list is well done and has selection to meet anyone's liking. Great mixed drinks and nice selection of beers as well.A nice dessert and after dinner drink menu is offered up.Service is excellent. Valet parking available. Expensive, yes, but worth the experience.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel5,"Scampo is a lovely upscale Italian Restaurant on the 1st floor of the Liberty Hotel. Â I did not make a reservation because I was next door and came there early for lunch. On the walls before entering Scampo is a framed picture of the owner Lydia Shire made out of pasta. The decor is warm and modern from the copper looking lighting over the bar, to the white linens, with beautifully folded napkins on the table and the dark woods intermittently placed around the room. This is no ordinary Italian Restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly especially my waiter Brian. He was very professional and well trained he couldn't have been more welcoming. I came here for lunch and after hearing the specials I decided on the Grilled Halibut with Â a Shrimp Risotto and Grilled Asparagus. My Halibut was seasoned perfectly, the inside was tender and flaked with a fork. The Shrimp Risotto was creamy and a nice accompaniment to the halibut along with the grilled asparagus . My sister-in-law had Skirt Steak with Yukon Gold, Red bliss hand mashed Chantilly Potatoes, Arugula Leaves, Autumn Quince. The Skirt Steak was tender and juicy, the Chantilly Mashed Potatoes had a twist with Parmesan cheese , heavy cream and lots of butter. On my table was artisan rolls and a plate of evoo for dipping.Scampo has a Mozzarella Bar. They serve one of my favorites Burrata Mozzarella with its creamy center and they pair it several ways. Â Scampo has a nice wine list and a full bar with seating Â so you can sit and eat there. They do have a GLUTEN FREE MENU.They also have a LATE NIGHT MENU. If you have time after lunch take an elevator ride to the second floor and walk around. You can have a drink and take some great pictures.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel5,"I came here for the first time for lunch during restaurant week. It is a swanky place right from when you walk into the hotel. Service was great, and everything was delicious and made well.For the $25 three course meal I chose: -Coconut Curry Soup (with shrimp): light, not spicy, and the perfect starter. Loved that they put the crispy shrimp on the side so that it would stay crispy until I put it into the soup. - Duck Confit (w/ risotto): Literally so freakin delicious. Duck was cooked to perfection (sauce is a tad salty but I'm pretty sensitive to salt). Risotto was smooth and delicious. Would recommend! -Cookie Plate: Personally I would pass in the future, and I wish I got the other options. There was nothing wrong with them but it just tasted like normal cookies (the lace one was my favorite though). I saw the other two options and they looked awesome. All in all would come again for lunch and dinner! Yum!",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel2,"I am extremely disappointed to be leaving this review. Â I was so excited to come here based on how all the yelp reviews rav about it. But first off. If I'm spending hundreds of dollars at dinner, I feel like you can park my car for a lot less than 27 dollars. Or maybe even free? Valet was pretty steep. The ambiance was great and I loved seeing the open kitchen. We had like 8 waiters and non of them ever introduced themself and the one who finally took our order literally just said ""you know what you're having?"" And it was the first time we ever even saw her! Who do we ask for a drink, I can't even shout their names because they never told us!I do appreciate that they put our dessert order in early since we had a show to make at 730pm, but someone introduce yourself!The food was good but why the heck do they put the breadsticks on the table???at first we thought she dropped them but then realized, nope that's where they intended to put them!

Of course parking will be an issue if you don't valet and the traffic will be horrible because of it's location...but still worth the hassles.,Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel4,"Wow, this place is outstanding. My only criticism is that the buratta was fairly tight and not as runny as I like it. But otherwise this place is worth the trip. The Elephant Ear bread is worth the trip alone, the spaghetti with peppers and crackling was a beautifully flavored dish, my date and I split this order. The brick chicken was a strange selection for us, we never order chicken out, but this dish was so good I wish we hadn't split it! Â The place is loud and busy, the vibe is not quiet romantic but it all works. Excellent service from Jovan(sp).",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel5,"Had one of my favorite meals ever here. What an original restaurant! The menu items are very unique and I loved every minute of this meal. When we first got to our table, they took a few pieces of breadsticks and literally laid them down right on the table and gave us some sauce. I knew I was in for something truly unique. The breadsticks were delicious and we ate every last bite of them. We also had the Spanish ham appetizer (sort of like prosciutto) and a scallop dish that was amazing. I wanted more.I did think about a steak, but when I saw a $44 Fish and Chips that included lobster, I had to try it. Could be the most unique take on a common dish I've ever seen. A piece of fish, which was great, perfectly cooked lobster with very unique sauces all over it, and super unique fries (I forget what it was, but it was not potato). Now, while eating it, I was thinking, this might be better with fries. But when I was done eating, and granted, I did have several appetizers which were delicious, I was super full. If they had put regular fries with it, it would probably have been too much. It ended up being perfect and I'll remember this meal forever.Scampo is a must!",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel5,"Dinner at Scampo was lovely. The hotel it's located in (Liberty hotel) is stunning and historical and we stopped first at Alibi Bar next door for a quick drink Â before dinner. The atmosphere of the restaurant was festive and the service was exceptional. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful. The food was delicious, too. We tried the duck entree and the brick chicken entree. Totally fantastic all around!",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel5,"Delicious once again. I've never had a bad meal here.I'm writing this while I sit in a food coma, in my office, wrapped in a blanket in front of my space heater. I am happy to say the least. Let's recap:Service- always top-notch. Everyone is so knowledgeable and quick to make well-thought out recommendations based on your tastes. Being a vegetarian limits my menu selections, but I've never had a boring meal at Scampo. Food- delicious. I try to challenge myself to try something new with each visit. As of today, my favorite menu item is the homemade parsley cavatelli (without the pork rind powder) but I am sure that I'll find another favorite soon enough. It goes without saying that the pasta is absolutely unreal here. Drinks- strong and perfectly-executed. If you have an hour, check out their wine Bible, I mean list.Atmosphere- classy, upscale, and modern. The open kitchen in the center is a nice touch. There are few things worth betting on entirely, but I know that with Scampo I am guaranteed a delicious meal and a memorable experience each time.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel5,"The rare time that this vegan cheats...it's here. It's for the Carbonara. Â Yes, it's that good...it makes a die hard vegan cheat about once or twice a year.

Â Great scene in every part of this hotel...go, you won't regret it.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel4,"The first thing that surprised me is that as soon as you are seated someone appears and brings you some bread sticks on a small plate... Normal, isn't it? Well... what's not normal is that instead of leaving the plate on the table they literally drop the sticks on the table... mmmm... I don't think I ever saw that in any of the good manners protocols out there... The ambience is nice and the brightness of the dinning room is just about right. Service is fine.Here's what we ordered:.- Fried Calamari: They were very good. The calamari were soft and tender and so fresh. I would personally have appreciated a little bit more crispiness on the outside but... overall a very successful appetizer. .- Crispy Cod: Very good as well. The cod was prepared beautifully and the dish did really deliver the crispiness its name was mentioning. I would certainly order it again..- Duck: I did not try it but my friend ensured me it was excellent. I can tell it looked amazing.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel5,"We are staying in the Liberty and Scampo is such a highly rated restaurant we have check it out. We had a reservation for two at 5:30pm and we were seated promptly. My partner asked for recommendations from our waiter and he literally recommended 3/4 of the menu. We did a few appetizers. First was the mozzarella sampler. It had fresh mozzarella with prosciutto and figs, a balsamic glaze, arugula and a very slightly fried mozzarella slice. We also got the scallops, which were tiny, but came with a piece of pork belly and a thin slice of squash. Last, we got garlic bread. And it was delicious. A bit crunchy and grill toasted. They also place these thin crunchy Parmesan bread sticks on the table with a pine nut dip that is just delicious. Similar consistency to a watered down hummus. I loved that. I got the Sunday Dinner so I had a Caesar salad, stuffed shells with chicken parm, and a dessert. My chicken parm was good - their red sauce is great. The shells had a bit of sausage and cheese in them which I wasn't expecting but was really flavorful. The dessert was good. It was an ice cream Neapolitan. There was pistachio, cherry and cherry chocolate. I was the biggest fan of the pistachio (unexpected) and then the chocolate. I think it had some cherry in it. I don't like cherrys so I'm didn't try the middle one. My partner got the duck. He loved it. Seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The gnocchi that comes with it was a bit small but still flavorful. Unusual for us, we got drinks. I got a Bellini which I thought was good. My partner had some sangria which had so many complex flavor notes. I couldn't believe it. Overall, highly impressed. And sad I forgot to take photos.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel4,"Had a delicious meal here, had the calamari and mozzarella. For dinner had the steak n pasta to share.

This restaurant is not authentic Japanese nor any upscale quality service at all. Because of its location and interior, I expected high quality service but the servers are just ok nothing special. I had a salmon donburi and there were only 4 small prices of salmon and also they were not that fresh. The donburi rice was not seasoned enough so I had to use lots of soy sauce. My husband Michael got donkatsu donburi and it was so thin like a paper and there was no meat at all. It was overly fried, so very dry and chewy. I cannot believe they charge for this worse than a food court sushi box quality food for $25-$30. Very over priced for its quality. Seriously if you want some authentic and high qualify Japanese food go somewhere else. I would not recommend this place to anyone who I care.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"2,"Major disappointment warning here. Â My wife and I went to Pabu for my birthday dinner recently and found that it was well below our expectations. Â I'm a huge Japanese food fan and I've been to some of the best in Boston, and around the world and I wouldn't even say that Pabu places on the ranking. Â This is truly unfortunate given all the hype around this place becoming the hot new sushi place in town. Setting: I'm actually a fan of the scene - subtle, cool distinctively Japanese. Â The restaurant is fairly large and has a good layout and bar area. Service: The waiter was friendly and attentive but definitely over-sold the omakase. Â I'd also say I wasn't a big fan of push for the up-charges on drinks and food.Food: We ordered the omakase with the promise that it was some of the Chef's best work with both on and off menu items. Â Sounds great, right? Â What we received was a mediocre set of dishes and sushi that could be found anywhere. Â I think I've had better sushi at grocery stores. Â I like to think of omakase as a chance for a chef to show off and set the bar - with this menu Pabu has set the bar extremely low. Â Everything was just rather boring with average quality that didn't match its prices. I know we would have been much better ordering straight off the menu (many of these items sounded better). We later contacted Pabu management (twice actually, with a phone call after an unreturned email) to express our dissatisfaction. Â The manager's response was a cold ""we've had mixed reviews on our omakase, thanks for the feedback"". Â I may not be a genius- but mixed reviews for a meal course is not a good thing - I've also been around customer service enough to know when to offer an apology versus defending your product/service. Â Overall, I'm disappointed that I bought into the hype around this celebrity chef owned restaurant. Â I really hope they improve, but I doubt I'd return.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"5,"WHAT TO TRY??The omakase experience!! For $99 USD, you can try out some of their best fishes and nigiri. We came on a weekday to this restaurant that's located on the second floor. The restaurant has a nice modern decor but it's not a restaurant you need to dress up for, which is nice. The server who served us was really nice and sat us right by the window where we can see the bustling streets below. The omakase selection was nice. Started us off with some soft poached egg dish which was amazing before we got into Nigiris and ended us off with some mochi dessert. We were so happy with the fish selection, we ordered additional fish on top of the omakase. All the fish were really fresh and felt like they literally melted in my mouth. I liked the uniqueness of the mochi flavor too. Unlike the typical cherry blossom or matcha flvored, this mochi was caramel flavoured. LAST TIP?!You don't have to come try out the omakase, you can equally have a great experience ordering the fish separately. They have booths seating or even sushi bar seats if you want to have a closer look at the fresh fish served at this restaurant. Don't leave this restaurant without trying the omakase at least once!",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"3,"Came for a group dinner in their private room. Had a great time celebrating one of our good friends but the meal and service in general were bumpy. They pace the courses really slowly... too slowly and we were all pretty hungry waiting. I think the server kept forgetting about my drink and it was accidentally spilled on someone but they didn't bring out another one until I ordered it again. And careful with the robatayaki. Ours were all undercooked and I'm not talking about the steak. I mean like the chicken and pork were all pink. Two of us caught it while everyone was busy scarfing down food but it was not just one plate that was underdone, all of them. The food is pretty good. The chicken out of the robatayaki was the best among our group and my personal favorite was the sea bass. When you're dining at a Michael Mina restaurant you kind of expect a more upscale experience especially with the price tag but they fell short on the finesse here.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"4,"Very classy izakaya & sushi bar.

Half price handrolls and karaage, plus some drink specials in the most convenient location. Seafood quality is great, food is inventive and prompt, what's not to love? Bartenders are super friendly, even when they're busy.We also had the matcha noodles and a mushroom tempura (pricey but) delicious.

For one, the service was very slow--it was slow between every step of the eating out process (from ordering through paying), but there was also a long lull of about half an hour between when my hot entree (miso cod) came out and my two friends' sushi combos came out, by which point, my fish had gotten cold.On a positive note, we thought the restaurant was beautiful and admired the variety of seating options.Okay, back to the food (aka what really matters). We all did the Dine Out Boston dinner menu which includes two appetizers and one main dish for $38/per person.+ Happy Spoon: We all got this for our first appetizer choice. A small spoon of uni, ikura, tobiko, oyster, and ponzu creme fraiche--what's not to love? If I had paid the regular menu price for it though, I would've felt that the portion was too small for the price.- Maitake Mushroom Tempura: This was by far the worst item of the night. I chose this as my second appetizer and it was flavorless, crunchy (and not in the good, light-and-airy way you'd expect when you see ""tempura""), and oily. AVOID!- Miso-Cured Black Cod: To be honest, this was a big part of the reason why I wanted to try PABU for Dine Out Boston and unfortunately, I was so disappointed! Again, this was bland and lacking any of the signature caramelization that makes an excellent miso black cod. I was filled with regret as I watched my friends enjoy their Roll Combo.+ Roll Combo: Okay, so I didn't try this but I definitely coveted it. Both my friends raved about their scallop hand roll in particular!",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"4,"Before I talk about the food, I need to give my server Damien a shout out. Originally, my tables server never showed up so my group and I were essentially sitting 15-20 mins before we started getting water and our orders taken from Damien who informed us that he'd be taking over. He did periodically ask if our server came by and the answer was always noThe drink menu has a huge variety of Japanese liquors and some cocktails. Theres also a variety of sushi as well. But we opted to the main menu, the food was good but I would definitely come back and try more of the menu. The karrage, foie gras were my favorite dishes of the night. My table really enjoyed the Australian wagyu. Thought the salmon belly was sliced too thick but overall decent meal.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"4,"Didn't have a single piece of sushi, but was still very happy with the Japanese cuisine. The gyozas were absolutely expert; some of the best I've ever had. The foie gras was ""interesting"", maybe a little too sweet, so I'll stick with traditional French preparations. The butter-bathed flank steak was absolutely phenomenal, and when they say ""butter-bathed"" - they are NOT kidding. The brown butter potato puree was super rich and flavorful, again; this place is not shy with the butter, which I am more than okay with.The vibe was pretty cool inside, and is authentically (as far as I know) decorated. I wish the restaurant was a little darker though, as I found it to be too bright inside.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"5,"PABU was a gorgeous and DELICIOUS place to bring 60 of my VIP persons last night.Looking for an event location for an office Christmas party?

PABUs team right now is on point. Â Linchul gave a very special sake presentation/demo/tasting/class that many of my guests just thought was the highlight.

The ramen lover that I am, I had to try this place. But overall I was very disappointed.The ambiance and atmosphere of this restaurant is beautiful. Honestly one of the most beautiful restaurants I've been to. Hostess was very friendly. Took a while for our server to come but I wasn't bothered. My friend and I came here for one thing only: ramen. We love ramen and it exists in our blood. We always look forward to trying new ramen places, and we take our ramen very seriously.First red flag for me was that you had to pay for meat... Meat is always included in the price for literally every ramen place I've been to, so that was a turn off. I like how you can choose your toppings, but meat is never a topping. It's part of the meal... I got the shoyu ramen with the pork and an egg.Ramen overall was on the pricier side. Presentation was beautiful, I'll give them that. But the ramen was WAY too salty, and I love salt. I couldn't even finish the bowl of ramen, and if you know me that's saying a lot on its own. The pork and the egg were the saving grace of the bowl. But the most disappointing aspect of the meal was the noodles... I live for noodles, but not these noodles. The noodles were so STARCHY, it felt like I was eating straight up flour. I tried giving it more chances but the more I chewed the more I was disappointed.I would NOT come back here for the ramen, but I would try the sushi. Very sad.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"4,"I have eaten here twice and had enjoyable and tasty omakase both times. Each time we've paid a little more to add-on their sushi complement to the omakase which I did think was worth it. Very nice and attentive service both times. I was looking for a nice Japanese restaurant with good food, not too dive-y, but not too ""froofy"" either. This was a solid choice for that, and a little on the pricey side. The only minus is that both times I've dined (weekend nights), the restaurant dining room was pretty noisy, and so it's not a quiet, intimate dinner. It does have a nice, classy decor. I agree with the ""stylish night out"" description mentioned by a previous reviewer.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"5,"Excellent!!! Â Either #1 or #2 of my high-end Japanese dining experience.We sat at the sushi bar at about 9:00 PM on a Friday night. Â The Executive Chef Benjamin Steigers was behind the bar prepping the sushi and robata dishes. Â He was awesome! Â Half of what we ordered we did based upon his recommendations. Â Try the Barracuda! Â Fantastic! Â We would not have had the same experience at a table. Â We had about 6-7 sushi orders and a robata order to share. While the food and watching the prep was great, I have a few comments:First, we arrived and were seated in the bar area, not the sushi bar but the bar area. Â This bar area could have been in any restaurant and did not give us a high-end Japanese restaurant feel at all. Â The Boston Red Socks were on the tv above the bar! Â We asked to be reseated and I told the manager that I would actually leave before eating in these seats as it was not reflective of what I was expecting of this restaurant. They put us at the sushi bar which was night and day better.Second, they have a nice sake list. Â We ordered a carafe of one and enjoyed it enough to order another. Â The second one tasted nothing like the first. Â We pointed it out to the server and she said she did not know what they poured first but that the second was the one we thought we ordered originally. Â They apologized and gave us a nice alternative.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"4,"Good food, Good location, Good atmosphere, one of the best place to go out for a date dinner. Its pricey but it is delicious. They also have happy hour so if you want to get something cheaper, certainly option is out there. Drink menus are nice also and I like how they serve you whiskey in a wine glass with huge ice in it. Some downsides? well its at downtown so parking could be a shit show, also food is great and all but not sure if it exactly matches up to that high end price. Certainly delicious, but certainly expensive for its taste. Maybe to have some casual drink at a bar with bite snacks, I would revisit, not for a meal.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"5,"Amazing place to enjoy top quality and fresh sushi !We sit on the bar and we had Ray as our personal chef to test the OMAKASE and enjoy other Small plates. It was so delicious and so refreshing! The chef did an excellent job by doing what we like and the flavors were like fireworks in the mouth... Not to mention I found my favorite French white wine (Chenin Blanc) and it was an amazing pairing with all our meal... Of course it's pricy not only because it's located in Boston and in the Millennium tower, but for all the good and fresh ingredients.. no regrets.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"4,"Monday through Friday PABU does a late night (9-10pm) happy hour menu with food and drinks.

Pabu is another amazing Asian fusion offering now in Downtown Boston. Located in Millennium Tower on Franklin Street, Pabu is the place to go for a stylish night out.From the fresh sushi and sashimi, to the cozy bowls of Udon, Pabu is just AMAZING. The high end decor and service make for a chic night out!

If you're a fan of oysters I suggest you place multiple orders for this. It's a freshly shucked oyster nestled in a chilled spoon, wrapped in a blanket of ponzu crÃ¨me fraiche, and topped with uni and ikura. It truly is the perfect bite of the ocean. Their omakase Â tasting will run you about $100 per head and I'm still trying to figure out if it's worth...It certainly has better value than their hot dishes.I've found that Pabu begins to lose a bit of its magic after each additional visit. They claim to rotate their omakase monthly, but I still clearly remember being let down by their radish maki course on the handful of times I've been. Their dessert, on the other hand, is fantastic and I highly recommend the Milk Chocolate Sesame Custard.Fun night out if you're big on ambience--they definitely score an A+ on that front.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"5,"Pabu is definitely one of the premier spots to eat sushi in Boston and can be compared to the likes of O Ya. It's fish is unquestionably one best around town. Been there for happy hour and for their omakase, and was not disappointed. Sushi is well prepared and the rice is not overly seasoned. However, it is tough to say that the portion sizes justify the price. Each nigiri is smaller than normal and the omakase has fewer courses than others of similar price point. However, it is without a doubt excellent in quality and if you are comfortable with the price, it's Â a great place to eat!",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"5,"Whoah. Came here with a friend on his birthday. I've tried several spots around Boston for sushi, none of which really blew me away like this place! This little gem is tucked away on a narrow street in little Chinatown, next to Tea Do (boba shop). It's a small space so you either get here in good time or be prepared to wait during prime dinner hours! With the concrete floors and metal furniture, Tora sets a minimalistic tone that puts the focus on their fish. I ordered the Torched Scallops and Takoyaki to start. Texture is everything to me when it comes to scallops, and Tora did not disappoint. It doesn't come with sauce or anything because they are excellent on their own. The takoyaki came out piping hot and fresh. Between me and my friend, we shared the Gyu Don (sweet beef over rice) and the Nagahama Don (yellowtail, squid, mackerel, salmon, shrimp & uni). The fish was slightly chilled below room temp and the beef was very flavorful and mouth-watering! Even the wasabi was freshly made, thus a little milder. The service was as expected for a place in Chinatown. If you need something, just make aggressive eye contact until they come over. The waitresses are very nice otherwise! Certainly will be returning next time I'm craving sushi!",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"3,"Decent lunch spot.The Maguro Toro Don is overall pretty good, but didn't mention that their otoro was seared. The wagyu bowl was a little disappointing as i thought the meat to rice ratio was rather low. the meat overall was pretty good, loved the egg on top, but the wagyu starts to taste bland after a while. Recommend: Personally I find the negitoro don tastier and of better value (if you ask for extra negitoro, they give you pretty much double at a $5 surcharge!)",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"I was disappointed that they ran out of Uni when I went here for my first time. I was really looking forward to that because it is a popular dish. However, the alternative I had was still amazing.The sushi was very fresh and nothing was salty or overdone in flavoring. Miso soup was on point and the pickled cucumbers was a nice touch next to the traditional ginger for cleansing your palette.The sushi rice could've been a little better in flavoring. It was very bland, however, I would take it over overdone rice.Prices are okay. Can't complain because it's similar to what you would get at a sushi restaurant if you ordered a chirashi bowl.I do love their playing and utensils. Very Japanese and elegant. I'm pretty sure their dishes cost them a lot. I love the subtle details they put into the restaurant.I would recommend people to go here for a sushi bowl. Perfect for a meal for one person.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"I get cravings for good Japanese or Japanese-esque food when I am traveling. While I was in Boston, I looked for a good Japanese type restaurant, and this one seemed the most interesting to me. I as started to walk towards the location of the restaurant, I realized I was walking into China town. So, my hopes of this spot being authentic was pretty much gone, but that was ok.The restaurant is a few steps down from the street. The space is not too big, but enough amount of seating. A staff came to me as soon as I entered, and directed me to one of the bar seat since I was alone. He was very nice and polite. He also explained the menu for me since I have never been there before.For drink, I ordered Iced Yuzu Tea, sweet and ice cold, perfect on a hot day! For the food, I wanted their Kaisen Don. I didn't find the perfect bowl with the sashimi I wanted. So, I ended up with Sake Ikura Don with Tuna added on. The food came out super fast! It was quite nice, good portion, it certainly hit the spot.The staffs were all non-Japanese, but they were very polite and helpful. I felt welcomed and it was good, relaxing lunch. Again, the price point could get high based on what you want, but the sashimi was fresh and pretty good portion.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"It took me forever to find this place, I'm pretty directionally challenged and not to mention you walk down some stairs in order to get to the space. First off it is in Boston's Chinatown it's kind of oblivious and probably why I missed it about 3 times. Once I got in I was promptly seated....I've been craving sushi for some time now and this place has some really good stuff going on! Not only are the bowls plentiful with sashimi style fish but they give you a really good amount of a little bit of everything in each bowl for whoever comes in. Everything was fresh and wonderful, also the nigiri was quiet good as well! I don't believe they have cocktails and maybe that's why it was somewhat empty but otherwise it was a solid choice for me and I'd come again.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Tora is a cute Japanese restaurant in Chinatown, and I would hands down recommend the dons over anything else here. The restaurant is relatively small with 5 tables and sushi bar seating. The staff are really nice and the food comes out fast.+UNI IKURA DON: Good amount of uni and ikura! Love the fishiness of the fish eggs in contrast with the creamy uni. +TORA DON: Lots of different kinds of fish. Great if you're looking for more variety in your bowl than just uni and ikura. +MATCHA CHEESECAKE: It's a small slice but it's dense and tasty! Tasty ending to a meal.-SPOT PRAWN NIGIRI: Not as sweet as sweet shrimp, and there's a meatier shrimp taste. Wouldn't get this over the sweet shrimp but just a matter of preference.-TORCHED SCALLOPS: Don't understand the liquid on the plate at all. Also, the scallop weren't torched enough, but glad that it still has the sweet scallop flavor. It was good because it was scallops but rather underwhelming as a dish. To note that the dons come with Japanese pickles and miso soup! All in all, would return for the uni ikura dons!",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Fast service and great quality food. We got a bowl to share, avocado fantasy and tako yaki. Fish was very fresh Â and rice is cooked to perfection. They have a (not so)secret menu on instagram, which our server showed us on her phone. Would come back and try everything on the menu!",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"A hidden gem in Chinatown! A small restaurant tucked in a basement, the seating is mostly around the bar. It's awesome to see the sushi being made. The unagi don was amazing -- it was soft, tender, and just the right amount of savory and sweet. It may not seem like a large portion, but it is so filling. The entree also comes with miso soup and Japanese pickle, both of which were good. The takoyaki was also great, coming in piping hot and full of seafood. Definitely a great place to visit for good Japanese food!",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Came here twice and was blown away each time. The location is pretty easy to miss as it's underground next to some of Chinatown's most popular spot. The gyudon was very good my first time and the second my friend and I shared the wagyu and the uni/salmon roe bowl and an order of takoyaki/matcha cheesecake. We were absolutely blown away by how delicious it was. The wagyu was so juicy and tender and with the salt sprinkled on top, it was just flavor overload! The uni and salmon roe were all delicious. The takoyaki and cheesecake were both great as well!

Â They serve mainly sashimi bowls and a la carte sushi. Â We got the sea urchin and fish roe bowl plus the shrimp salmon fish roe bowl. Both options had good portion and were delicious.

The fish they used was always fresh and of high quality, which is really important because it's served (mainly) raw. The downsides might be that since the place is small, oftentimes you'd be arranged to seat by the bar (which is nice, but personally I wouldn't say it's better than a real table). Also it can be a little pricy, especially considering the small serving. But in general, the quality of their food makes all these concerns insignificant.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"Sashimi over a bed of sushi rice is a simple dish but what a delicious dish it is. Of course it's not just raw fish here. I've been here twice now, and the gyudon and kaisendons are delicious and insta worthy. The dons come with a miso soup and pickles. Personally, I'd prefer a little more variety to their cooked food don options (oyakodon!!) but the sushi bowl variety is great.If you're looking to try the wagyudon I would suggest waiting for it to be a special. It's $28 for 2oz of wagyu, though I'm not sure how that compares to the non special amount at $38 Service is quick here with a few tables and a countertop where you can eat and watch the chefs in action.

I tried their:+ Uni Ikura Don ($24) - Uni and ikura galore! Generous portion of both and the uni was very sweet and fresh+ Tokyo Don ($18) - Seared salmon, impressively-tender-squid sashimi, scallop, masago+ Maguro Toro Don ($22) - All three variations of tuna were delicious--the fatty tuna was melt-in-your-mouth amazing and even the leaner cut of tuna was super flavorful.

The octopus was not as fresh as I expected and super chewy from being in the freezer too long. Noodles were average but barely any veggies, they used salad as their veggies, the soup tasted good.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"A great casual sushi/bowls spot hidden in chinatown!

I ordered the torched scallops to start. They only have us 4 so was kind of disappointed considering it cost $10. The scallops were also cold which was fine but confused my mouth since I was expecting hot or warm from the ""torched"" description. For my meal I ordered K7 which had minced tuna, tuna sashimi, and torched sashimi! Great combination. The minced tuna went best with the mixed rice. My only complaint is that the serving size seemed to be in the smaller side. From the pictures on yelp, i thought it would be bigger!",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"5,"Great place for Japanese food in Chinatown! Â I got the Sake/Salmon bowl with belly, classic sashimi, and minced salmon. Â The minced salmon was a little bit strange, gooey and sweet, but the belly and regular sashimi was DELICIOUS. Â The bowls are deceptively small but will most likely fill you up.Not a lot of seating, most of them in the ""bar"" around the kitchen which means you can see people preparing your meal.

After the whole poke bowl craze took over Boston, I was excited to see a more authentic version open up in Chinatown. The fish here is decent and the amount they give is fine. However, I judge sushi bowls largely based on the quality and taste of the rice, since you are basically eating a full bowl of rice and the rice here was not impressive. I ordered the wagyu don and tried the nagahama don. Again, the portions seemed fine. The wagyu was super tender and basically melted in your mouth, but since the bowl only comes with about 6 slices of wagyu, an egg, and rice, I felt myself eating plain rice most of the time. The rice wasn't flavored like you would find in some other Japanese restaurants. I felt like they could have added some sweetness or seasoning to the rice or at least added some other fillers in the bowl to add more flavor. The fish and meat quality were great, so if the rice was flavored, this meal would have been amazing.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,I came here with my mom for lunch on a Friday. The interior is small and minimalistic but beautiful. I like the wooden theme but I thought the tables were too small especially if you order a lot.

It doesn't seem much but you definitely will get full!,Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"4,"I came to Tora wanting some sushi after eating the typical white people food in Boston. I wanted something different and wanted to explore the chinatown area too.I ordered the Tokyo Don which comes with scallop, torched salmon belly, squid and flying fish roe. I wanted to add some uni and yellowtail which was an extra charge of $4 each. The chirashi style bowl comes with miso soup on the side. I thought the fish was good but nothing spectacular. I did really like the fact that the bowls come with an assortment of fish so you don't get bored eating it. Â I came here partly because I was on a business trip so I could expense the whole meal.

They ran out of the fried calamari so we just got the fried squid balls and braised beef noodle soup in medium spice.SO GOOD. I recommend and I'll be back. The fried squid balls were definitely a nice little side. Not too heavy despite them being fried and lightly seasoned. The braised beef noodle soup is so good, y'all have got to try it. The medium spice had sliced up, fresh red chili peppers and it was such a nice little touch. It added a good amount of spice to it and here and there, I'd accidentally eat a bit of it and it was so spicy. Medium is the way to go if you can a good amount spice! No extra sauce needed.

The service was nice and fast, the people were welcoming, and most importantly, the food here was AMAZING. We both ordered spicy Taiwanese beef noodles and also had a oyster omelette (è_µä»”ç…_) for share. The broth of the noodles was savory and the beef was stewed so well that the tendon was soft and totally absorbed the tastes of the spices. The thickness of the noodles was also on point. As for the oyster omelette, the texture was a little more slimy than I expected, but still tasty in general. They also had boba tea, braised pig feet, braised pork rice bowl, wonton and some fried rice that I didn't get a chance to try. Definitely would come back when I get a chance.

Yelp did not lie! We started off with the popcorn chicken which was a MUST recommendation from all of the other reviews that we were read. Perfectly crispy and exactly what we had been craving. I had the Braised Beef Noodle Soup and my husband had the Stir-Fried Udon Noodles. My Beef Noodle soup had very flavorful broth and was filling and very yummy. The stir fried udon noodles were okay but if we were to come again I would definitely get my husband to choose another dish. I also got the chance to try out the sea salt cream tea. My initial reaction was one of surprise because I was not expecting it to actually be salty. But once you've gotten a taste of the salty cream and then drank the refreshing green tea, the combination is absolutely amazing. I am craving it all over again! My husband also got coffee flavored boba and it was very yummy! The service was great, our server was very attentive and sweet and we felt very welcomed.

We went at an off time so the establishment was relatively empty with the exception of one other table. We ordered the milk tea with boba, braised beef noodle soup, braised pork belly appetizer, and the crispy fish fillet. They know their bubble teas. I am a KFT fan, but their milk tea is comparable if not better. The pork belly was a rice plate dish, but I opted to get just an appetizer portion, not on the menu but they were able to accommodate it. The pork belly was the fall apart in your mouth kind of tender, braised with a soy sauce base. The beef noodle soup was flavorful, just had a small kick to it. I chose to skip the tendons in the soup and only have beef flank. The soup did not disappoint. The fish fillet was a bit of a let down, it was essentially fried fish on top of some white rice and then drizzled with ketchup. Skip. I will be back for their bubble teas at minimal..",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"Unlike many Taiwanese restaurants that pride itself on an expansive menu, this place sticks with a relatively narrow menu offering basic staples: rice and noodle dishes. Â The place was quite packed when we arrived on a Saturday evening. Â But turnover was high enough that we were seated in about 15 minutes. We ordered three appetizers: scallion pancake with fried egg - this was rather unremarkable; sweet potato fries - nicely done; and what I would call chicken nuggets. Â For Main entrees, we had beef noodle soup and pork cutlet over rice. Â The beef in the noodle soup was very tender and the broth was well flavored. Â Pork cutlet over rice is a Taiwanese staple and I order it at every Taiwanese restaurant as a benchmark. Â The pork was nicely breaded and fried. Â It was accompanied by stir-fried cabbage and stewed turnip and radishes. Â I was hoping to see a hard-boiled egg which wasn't in their version.The food wasn't overwhelmingly spectacular. Â Maybe the place is more well-known for their beverages which took up half of the menu. Â If you're looking for authentic Taiwanese food, this would suffice, but it won't leave you longing for more.What really stood out here, however, was the friendly service. Â I have written several reviews on Chinese restaurants and if there is a theme, it is sticking with the efficient-but-lacking-friendliness service model. Â Not here. Â There was an incredibly friendly and warm waitress who not only attended to our every need immediately, she also chatted with us and genuinely showed an interest towards our children. Â I was blown away by her service and attitude and believe she's the true game changer in this place.As with all restaurants in this area, parking is a real struggle. Â The clientele is decidedly 20-something Asian couples, but we didn't feel out of place with our young children in tow. Â Maybe it's because of the warmth we felt from our waitress...",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"5,"I'm deeply ashamed at myself - I call myself a foodie, yet I've completely missed a trending drink that is so godly delicious - Sea Salt Cream Top Tea. Â HOW HAVE YOU FLOWN UNDER MY RADAR FOR SO LONG?? Â This absolutely replaces boba tea.For those that are as oblivious as myself and have no idea what this is - well, it's basically sweetened tea, with a thick layer of foam on top. Â This foam literally tastes like creamy sea salt - and while this mixture seems bizzare at first, the combination compliments each other perfectly. Â Get a good swig, sipping up the cream with some refreshing tea right behind it in one sip, and it'll change your life. Â After having it here, we were craving it the day after, and luckily found another place that offered it in Chinatown - and although it was good, Dolphin Bay will still be my #1 choice for this beverage.But this isn't a review just about their amazing Sea Salt Creme Top Tea. Â The rest of the Taiwanese dishes here are justifiably great - they have a solid beef noodle soup, a staple in my native cuisine, and the serving was ENORMOUS (think the size of Pho!) Â  Â Their popcorn chicken, done perfectly - moist chicken bites around crispy batter, with a sprinkle of savory and spicy powder. Just like home. Â We also had their dan bing (egg pancake) which was also solid, although I wish it was a bit bigger portion wise. Â Price point, cheap as you can get around greater Boston. Â Service was mostly solid, although could be more attentive. Â The decor was nautical themed as well, but don't expect a fancy sit down. Â Overall though, no noteworthy cons. Â They also have solid fresh brewed tea, complimentary with your meal! Â I'll definitely be back, if not just for a quick stop to pick up some of that yummy Sea Salt Cream Top Tea.",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"5,"Was looking for a quick lunch in Allston and was so happy to find this place! It's very reasonably priced, the food is authentic, and the staff is kind.We were seated almost immediately, and when the server took a while to greet us and take our order she apologized and offered some complimentary milk tea to make it up. We really appreciated it and it was delicious.The beef noodle soup was definitely the star of the meal, but the taiwanese popcorn chicken was yummy as well. I wish the chicken dish would have had more vegetables on the side but that's just me. The chicken was crispy and well-seasoned and there was plenty of rice to go with it. The noodle soup had a delicious broth and was just what we needed on a cold day.I will definitely be back here!",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"3,"First of all I love all the food here I've tried the past 3 times. The beef noodle soup is wonderful, warming to the soul, and their wonton noodle dish is blissful. I've never had a bad dish here. But it hurts to say but honestly the past Saturday we went and the service was incredibly slow. My fiance's wonton noodles came out 20 minutes after my beef noodle soup did. I did not want to start eating without him but after 10 minutes, I felt very impatient because it was already 2:30pm. The waiter also did not ask if I wanted anything to drink so my fiance had to ask him later. Also at the start, we didn't get menus when seated. We grabbed them ourselves. Other guests had to wait to get serviced after sitting down for awhile. There were 3 people behind the counter so I don't know what's wrong. Our waiter did not seem to be rushing to serve folks. If it was me, I'd be dashing and zipping through the dining room like mad.The first few times I've visited were not like this. I hope this is a one time occasion. If it gets better next time, I'll update the review, no doubt.",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"3,"Packed on a Sunday afternoon, I anticipated waiting in line to get a table and slower than average service for our orders: 2 entrees and appetizer. Fine. However, having two parties receive their orders when arriving much later than us is unacceptable. A party of four had nine dishes, and the two next to us had theirs. No refills on water during the waiting period, in a stuffy room when it's 93F outside. I suspect they forgot to punch in our orders as I'd rather hope that was the reason. We observed confusion and fumbling around with order tickets as meals and beverages were frequently sent to wrong tables. Maybe it was a one-off day, but they cleary are understaffed. We contemplated leaving in frustration. Finally, my Taiwanese cravings were satisfied. Normally, reviewers who offer a mediocre rating do so because the service elevated their subpar meals, but our experience was the opposite. Dismal service, good good food.",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"The people love Dolphin Bay, that's what I've always heard. The little joint serving Taiwanese cuisine in Allston has been rumored to have some, if not the best Asian fare around. Took me long enough, but I had to wage my own claim investigation. My findings? Deliciousness across the board! Tried several dishes but the stir fried noodles are absolutely the best of the bunch. The milk tea to wash it all down is the icing on any cake.I formally grant permission to believe the hype. Pleasant and engaging service, affordable delicious food, fresh homemade juices and teas....winner winner, Taiwanese dinner!",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"5,"Great great *cheap* spot for Taiwanese food. Here are some tried and true faves+popcorn chicken - nice appetizer although not the most flavorful but a popular dish+shaved ice- very instagrammable, wish it had some more condensed milk though to make it taste even better++spicy wontons - delicious, tastes just like the ones my mom makes!+++Taiwanese fried rice- I'm a real fan of the Taiwanese sausage bits they add in the fried rice",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"5,"I'm sure this spot is a favorite Taiwanese Food spot for a lot of people. What makes Dolphin Bay different from any other Asian restaurant in Boston is their authentic Taiwanese hospitality. No matter how busy they never ignore anyone arriving at their door, or waving at the table. Pros: 1. Authentic Taiwanese food with good portion size and reasonable price. Their rice dishes are super filling and comes with sides like steamed eggs, veggies, etc. 2. Very tempting appetizer menu featuring lots of Taiwanese street food, having someone that knows the food culture would defiantly be helpful here! A group of friends could also order a bunch appetizers here, sit and chill here with their bubble tea! They have amazing popcorn chicken! This is a very popular Taiwanese street food where they deep fry small pieces of chicken in a flavorful batter, tossed in some white pepper. The popcorn chicken at Dolphin Bay are a good size, meat is moist and seasoned, and you could add some hot chilly if you'd like! I also recommend trying their Wontons because it is made in house and they are the size they should be! The skin to meat ratio is perfect, if you really like wontons, their wonton soup is also a must try. 3. Gotta love their wonton soup! There is a lot and it comes in a big bowl (bigger than my face big) and there are a lot of wontons, a good amount of noodles and bak choy. 4. The beef noodles soup brings me back home to Taiwan! It has huge chucks of tender beef shank, beef tendons Â and the bowl is a hearty bowl of beef broth that is perfect in a cold day. 5. Their ground pork rice/noodles is also a must try. The Taiwanese method of cooking ground pork makes it perfect for topping rice and noodles. They actually sell tubs of this ground pork for you to bring home! 6. They're also very accommodating and they'll tell you what noodles are best for which soup! And if you have any questions and concerns they defiantly take it seriously and they'll come by to check that things have been done right. 7. This is a perfect lunch spot in between classes to get a good warm meal that's cool fresh and maybe even grab a drink to go. For dinner it is always crowded but people are always willing to wait, so defiantly come early fo seats! Cons: 1. This place just needs more seats..!!!!",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"Food:-The braised beef noodle soup is my favorite here(must get). You can adjust the spice level to your liking and it comes with an adequate amount of noodles and beef. They'll ask you if you want to do all beef or half beef half tendon. The tendon is perfect and melts in your mouth! -Popcorn chicken is okay, it's nothing outstanding but still taste good!Drinks:Their bubble tea is pretty decent however it's a bit pricey compared to any other bubble tea you can get down the street. Service:Every time I go in I've gotten great customer service. Typically I get seated immediately or at least acknowledged if it's busy and they're always friendly!",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"4,"I went here for dinner with my friend this weekend. There were 3 empty tables(one with 4 chairs, one with a bench and two chairs, and one table with 2 chairs but next to a beam that blocked the space for a chair). They offered us only the latter table with 2 chairs next to the beam). Since it was cramped, they suggested we sit side by side. We asked if we could sit at the other tables but they said the table was for four people. Weird.Anyway, we ordered the popcorn chicken with mild spice, beef stuffed pancake, and spicy wonton noodles. The popcorn chicken was flavorful, not too salty. The beef pancake was great as well. The wonton noodles was a generous portion and delicious. It had about 6-7 wontons, green veggies and a touch of spice(not too spicy).For a drink, I got the sea salt foam jasmine green tea. They added a dolphin on top of the foam. Cute! The drink was very good and had a lot of tea flavor. The drink was not too sweet and with the salt, it balanced the flavor of the drink. At the end of the meal, one of the waitresses also gave us a stamp card for our drinks. After the 5th stamp, you get a free small pork fried rice. After the 10th stamp, you get a free drink. Nice touch!",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"5,"In a year that I've had some really great meals, my meal at SRV was my favorite meal. All the dishes we ordered were excellent, from apps to dessert. However, the pasta dishes were truly impressive. The pasta we had were Mezzaluna, Tajarin and Corzetti. As other reviewers mentioned, these moderate portions which I guess is typical of Venetian fare. All three pastas were innovative, unexpected, simple yet layered. Each had their own merits and stood out from one another. Ideally when visiting a restaurant, I want to experience something new in terms of flavors, style, ingredients, textures, or combination, and ideally, it tastes really good, too. We got that several times at SRV. I would return without hesitation!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"We live down the street and first tried out SRV right after they opened. The service was poor, and the food was okay.We returned tonight to find MUCH improved service, and food. In particular the Parmesan biscuits and the crespella were fantastic. They also have a great open air patio in the back which was nice and cool, even on a hot summer night.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"First time trying this Venetian italian restaurant, and was really impressed! Party of 7, made reservation in advance and was seated immediately. Tried a bunch of items off the menu, definitely recommend sharing a couple appetizers, and main courses. Stand outs were the chicken pasta (ravioli like). it had a kick of spice which was great. and the Nervetti Fritti. I remember the meatballs being good as well. Frutti di Mare Risotto was okay, a good amount of seafood, but the risotto felt a little runny.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"Did not know what to expect and was blown away. Â Went back twice to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Â It wasn't. Â I'd put this in the Toro, little donkey, Neptune tier for boston, but at a much better value. Â The restaurant is beautiful, staff friendly and helpful. Â This place is underrated. Â Wine selection is great. Â Not a bad word to say - must try in Boston.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"Came here with a group of co-workers after a client visit. We were greeted and seated immediately although we didn't love the fact that they seated our party of 5 at a table with one chair at the end. Space was fine but it definitely felt like they were keeping us from an empty seat at a 6 top, which isn't in line with top-notch service.I'll also add that while the service from our primary server was attentive (if cold), one of the servers bringing food dropped a portion of one of our dishes on the floor and was observed by someone in party noticing that he had dropped the food. Instead of immediately returning that plate to the kitchen he served it to us and did not even pick up the food on the floor until after.So... why does this review get 4 stars? The food.We all ordered the prix fixe menu, and were treated to a wide array of delicious offerings from the roasted carrots to the parmesan biscuits to the pasta dishes. All of our individual items were unique, flavorful, and together made for a disjointed if elaborate and surprising experience.With two in party having specific diets (one pork free, one vegetarian) they were able to provide the same level of flavor and variety; while that should be an expectation not a pleasant surprise, it's still appreciated.Our only food issue was the order of items: They served us two large bowls of pasta at the end of the meal, and while there was an extended time gap between our previous plates and the pasta plates, they were too large comparatively to the size (and amount) of the other plates and sadly went uneaten.One note about ambiance: While it was on the warmer side, the decor was tasteful without being showy and the space was full of noise without being loud. While our party enjoyed the soundtrack full of hip hop music, not all diners would necessarily appreciate a single style of music being played throughout the entire evening. Frankly it felt a little too clever and 'trying to be hip' for its own good though they know their typical clientele better than me.Ultimately I've hesitated to give this review 4 stars because I definitely don't want to perpetuate the all-too-common trend in restaurants where they can overcome poor or mediocre service with quality food: any truly excellent experience should be a blend of both, without one needing to cover for the other.That said, the poor choice of a single server shouldn't take 2 stars off what was a delicious and interesting meal in a pleasant atmosphere.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,As a New Yorker working in Boston for the last six years i've excepted and surrender to the fact that the stone in sooner eat past 9:30 PM. So on that now finding great cuisine it's hard here in the city however one of my friends Brooklyn New York or as myself told me to come to SRV this evening on the corner of mass Avenue in Columbus. As an Italian citizen living in New York for the last 20 years and coming to an Italian restaurant in Boston I'm surprise she know for the fact that you serve carpaccio with pretzels in it and I say why why and why it's wrong just remove them from the plate and on top of that fried potatoes not Italian stick to Italian cuisine. I have never heard carpaccio served with fries potatoes. John at substract edit serve carpaccio as it's meant Â to be served with arugula or pear shavings goat cheese blah blah blah. Â or parmigiano and go from there.The best dry rose from Toscana,SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"A delectable second visit! Venetian food is Â light, fresh and simple. So plates tend to be small but are they ever delicious! In Venice , Â it's customary to pop in for cicchetti (tapas) at a wine bar for small bites. This could happen as often as you like. SRV is Venetian inspired so, Â I had to have a few before dinner ;)). Â But they have a great prix fixe that includes a few snacks. Â I loved my last visit here and for under $50, I got Â their well composed cicchetti and small plates. Â Sold! Â Haha. The Food: Â If you don't know Venetian cuisine, SRV is the place to experience this food. Â Don't expect huge plates of pasta and cheese, or the typical Sicilian American plates you'll find at your fave North End hangout. Â I've been to Venezia over 20 times and the food here rocks over most cicchetti there. Plates are excellently flavored and layered deliciously. Â If you want larger, go for the Grani plates. Â Again, Northern Italian dining is not Buca or Maggianos type servings. Oh yah! Â And don't forget wine pairings!!! Â That's why you want to go for a cicchetti stop anyway. They have aptly available Italian and US wines to pair with the food here. Â Ask your server or somellier; Â I've had very competent help each visit. Service: Â Everyone looks like they love working here. I truly enjoyed Marsha's help and attentiveness. Thanks Marsha! You're too awesome!Visits: 3Tip: Â Reservations required or sit at available spaces at the bar or counter. Â It's packed here.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"We were very satisfied with our dinner here this past Friday night. For a restaurant in the area it is in, I was surprised how spacious it was. The space is divided in half with a bar area on your right, a dining area to your left and a back patio (where we chose to sit) that offered a more intimate ambiance. There is a small patio area in the front as well with tables that would comfortably fit may 2-3 people. Great area if you're looking to enjoy a glass of wine. It is a wine bar after all! We, however, came here based on the food menu. We ordered two dishes from the cicchetti list which are basically small tapa dishes. The Polpette, or meatball, was delicious but definitely smaller than what I expected based on the pics from yelp. I don't remember the name of our second dish but I think it had tuna or salmon served with pickled cucumber on top. It was good but nothing to rave about.Onto the grani- we had the Tajarin and the Mafalde and both were amazing. Both the tajarin and mafalde were cooked more al dente than what we were used to but it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.The sugo in the mafalde was tender and complimented the sauce very well. The tajarin I thought was the best. So creamy and rich, I did not want it to end! Â As for dessert, we tried a sorbetti (kiwi) and a gelati (peruvian chocolate). If i can recall, their gelati/sorbettis are homemade. The peruvian chocolate gelati was just amazing. It reminded me of the Guylian seashell truffles but better. The sorbetti was okay but will try another flavor next time.Overall, friendly hosts and attentive staff. Parking is horrible so I would allot at least 30 mins to find parking on the street.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"Really lovely atmosphere and interesting appetizers/small plates.On food - highly recommend trying a bunch of the cicchetti and the small plates/appetizers. Menu changes often, but there are always tons of interesting items and flavors. We started with the tuna belly and cod cicchetti, both of which were great! Very flavorful and a bit on the saltier side, which is how I like it. Then we had the chickpea polenta, which was so delicious and so special. Very eclectic mix of flavors and textures (slightly indian/mediterranean spices) - must get! We then had the tarjarin pasta and rigatoni ragu pasta. Both good, but I would probably go for 2 small plates and 1 pasta next time. Pastas weren't quite as special for me. They also have a pretty extensive italian wine menu. On atmosphere - A bit on the louder side, but lovely interior and nice garden outside in the back. They also open up the garage door in the front of the restaurant, which is really nice to get some fresh air in the summer. There is often a wait if you don't make reservations, but nice place to grab a drink out front while you wait.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"12/17First I'd like to thank the folks at our favorite local restaurant, Sorghum&Salt, for taking the time to give us this recommendation. Their Sous Chef trained here, so I knew we were in for a treat! The decor is industrial and softly lit. Simple, clean and welcoming. We had numerous shared plates and nothing was less than brilliant! Attention to detail with excellent balance of flavors and bravely making humble vegetables the stars of the plate! It takes talent to do that! I love the unusual ingredients and the playful combinations of flavor. To put it simply, I want to taste something I'd have no clue how to replicate at home. Here, you will. We will be visiting Boston again, and we definitely will be coming back here for some more! Meanwhile, we can enjoy Sorghum&Salt wizardry! Lucky up and down the east coast!Side note - picture quality is sub par due to lighting. But I tried.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"How do I feel about this place? You know when you've just discovered a new artist/singer who is amazingly good & you can't wonder how someone this good isn't famous but at the same time you're glad because you end up having them all to yourself?Yeah, that's exactly how.PROS:- See specifics below!- Great service!CONS:- I would definitely recommend a reservation ahead of time. They get good business here and there aren't that many tables available.- Some people complain that the servings are small for the price but you need to factor in the quality too. I have been to restaurants that were way more expensive but gave only typical of tourist food & I feel like the food here is of such a greater quality that I'm surprised they're not charging more.SPECIFICS:- Roasted Sunchokes = This 1st dish pretty much set the tone for the rest of dinner. The pairing with the sweetness of raisins & the apples were perfect. The apples, nuts, & sourdough bread gave the texture that fois gras lacks. I think the sourdough had a hint of cinnamon that really sneaks up on you in the back of your tongue and it was a welcomed surprise.- Ribeye = I never knew that meat could be so tender and soft until this. The ribeye felt like it melted in my mouth. The oxtail was perfectly done, & that's coming from someone who grew up in HK, in a culture that has perfected the marination of oxtail. They also added mint & that just elevated the entire dish to a whole new level. Never in my mind did I ever think to put them into one & after having tried this I can't help but wonder why in the world I had never thought of it before. It's just amazing!- Squash Casoncelli = I love cheese but ravioli has always been something I stand away from since it was just way too heavy to me. But having tried squash stuff-ravioli made me realize there was a whole new side of the ravioli world that I have never experienced and whenever I go to an italian restaurant I would always check the menu ahead of time to see if there was squash ravioli available. This casoncelli is a dumpling rather than ravioli, but the same logic applies. The squash was just as creamy as any other cheese substitute that I could think of and it didn't make me feel overstuffed. It also gave it this sweetness that cheese could never provide. On another note, the casoncelli shell was just perfectly done. It was thin but still strong enough to hold the stuffing together.- Lumache = The tomato sauce was well done, not too sour to pull away from the other flavors in play but still made its own stance. Not a single one of the small tomatoes it came with was sour (they know how and when to pick their ingredients). Great dish. My only complaint is that I wish they had given more snails because I love escargot. Special highlight was the squid ink breadcrumbs it was topped with. We couldn't for the life of us figure out what it was but it was so interesting and tasted so good we just had to ask the waiter.- Sopa Coada = The duck was, once again, done very well. The poached egg on top was an interesting addition but with every unique combination they've hit with us so far, this one was another good call. If it weren't for the poached egg, I might have thought the duck was a little too salty but wrapping it with the cabbage while soaked in the broken egg yolk was perfection. My absolute favorite about this was the picked green apple slices. I don't like green apples since they are too sour for me & I would've thought pickling them would make them even more sour but it brought out a sweetness in the apples that I never knew they had.- Pine Nut Semifreddo = I love concord grapes. They just have this unique taste that normal grapes can never get. I grew up with concord grape flavored candy from HK and the scoop of the sorbetto brought me back to my childhood. The pine nuts were also plentiful so they didn't skimp on ingredients even when they may be expensive. The thing that truly told me the chief knew what he was doing? The drizzle of peanut sauce. So creamy and rich. And it wasn't sweet! THAT'S how you know it's made by real peanuts since genuine peanut butter should not be sweet (it's all artificial sugars!).- Roasted Kiwi Sorbetto = Not my personal favorite of the night, just far too sour for me but my sister loved it.- Ricotta Cocoa Nib = I would have never known this was made out of ricotta because it tasted just like ice cream. The cocoa and pistachio were great. I would order this again.- Fior di Latte = Not the standout compared to the semifreddo but still very good. Creamy and sweet, just the way I like it. I only wish the quince jam was just a little sharper in flavor since the creaminess of the latte overwhelmed the jam a bit.Instagram @bowtiebowie for more food adventures!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"We went there on a Saturday dinner and decided to get the arsenale menu (10 courses) and some cocktails. It was $45 for the whole course, and cocktails were about ~$12 range (Titus Sparrow, Corsinis Fortuna, Gateways to Riches). Gateways to riches was very fruity and light.The courses came out starting with small bites, and the portion gradually got bigger. I've attached photos for all the courses, so it is easier to gauge the portion of each course. FYI, I went there in a group of four, so some of the plates came out as family size so we can share among four, and some plates were meant for two people. The salmon dish and the second pasta with white sauce (forgot the name of it) were my two favorites. My husband really like the pork dish. Other dishes were also very tasty and unique in its own style. The ambiance can be good for date night. The waiter was external friendly and attentive. Will revisit when we come to Boston again.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"Good spot. Got here at 5:30p on a Friday night without reservations and snagged two seats at the bar. Drink menu was creative and I ended up with a rum/Campari/coconut drink which strong and not too sweet which I appreciated as an end to the week. Ordered some small plates to share, an appetizer and an entrÃ©e. The meatball cicchetti was delicious!!! An order comes with two lamb/beef meatballs which are bite-sized but bursting with flavor. Also would recommend the buffalo mozzarella cicchetti and the olives. The appetizer was a cheese filled crepe topped with lamb (which actually wasn't as flavorful as expected) but there were so many creative and inventive options that it did not dissuade me from coming back and trying a new variety of dishes. The atmosphere was chic but not pretentious and the service was fantastic. Will definitely return.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday on a Friday night and had an amazing experience! I made a reservation ahead of time with a few special requests and they were completely accommodating. Our waitress was super friendly and made sure we were happy. She even got us a bigger dessert for his birthday!I would highly recommend trying the tasting menu. Every plate was great and came at a good pace. We could tell that the chef put a lot of thought into each course. We ended up being pretty full after and it was definitely worth the price, especially for a special occasion.The space itself is beautiful and in a great location. Our reservation was at 5:30pm and it was pretty empty at that point so noise wasn't an issue. We also had a table in the corner, which was nice and private. I had never glanced at this restaurant before despite probably passing by it a million times, but decided to come here through a friend's recommendation. I would definitely come here again to celebrate a special occasion!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,The food lives up to the hype. Service was good and the pasta was amazing. Cocktails could use some work. Definitely going back. Outdoor seating in the back.,SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"What a roller coaster it feels like with SRV. After two less than stellar experiences due to long wait times, I had a great experience this past Sunday. My parents were in town and are huge fans of Italian food, so I thought I would bring them to SRV. We were seated promptly at 730, and drinks came out fairly quickly. Food: honestly rarely disappoints. We had the mussels to start, which came with a nice extra basket of bread. Mussels were plentiful and fresh. We then shared the garganelli and the tortelli, both of which were flavorful and cooked to perfection. My parents loved them both. Finished the night with the tiramisu (I get this every time and I think it's incredible. Lady fingers melt in your mouth with a distinct but not overwhelming taste of rum, smooth and light; I could eat this forever) and the semifreddo. Overall, I really love this restaurant Â (my fourth time here!) And despite some rocky service in the past, the food and staff are outstanding. We will definitely continue to be loyal customers!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"I've wanted to try SRV for quite some time, but the only times available were either very early or very late evening. We finally settled on an early 5pm dinner since we weren't sure when we'd be able to get reservations again. I'm so glad we went because this place did not disappoint! The decor is simple yet sophisticated at the same time. The overall ambiance was enjoyable and not at all noisy or crowded. There was a private party sectioned off behind the blue doors, but they didn't disrupt the rest of the diners at all. And now what we came here for: the food! Our waitress explained that the menu is broken up into three sections: bites (literally one bite), small plates, and larger plates, all to share. For bites, we ordered the potato croquettes and the special, octopus with celery root and olive. The croquettes were good (can't go wrong with deep fried potato) and the special was delicious. The octopus, celery root, and crumbled olives went really well together. For small plates, we ordered the sunchokes and stuffed squid. The sunchoke dish was very interesting and tasted like fall on a plate. You have your roasted root vegetable, chestnuts with cinnamon or nutmeg like spices, and a bit of shaved foie gras. The squid was stuffed with what looked like squid ink risotto and came with a kale salad, which was so good and really the star of the dishes. For the large plates, we shared the bauletti and octopus risotto. I'm not a huge fan of ravioli and bauletti was a ravioli type pasta, but that was my fault for not asking the waitress beforehand. We enjoyed the octopus in the risotto, but the risotto itself was ok. It's a tomato based dish, so maybe I just like the typical creamy risotto better. For dessert, we ordered the kiwi sorbet with coconut cream, ricotta cocoa nib gelato, and the coffee magic shell gelato. The ricotta and coffee magic shell gelatos were so good I wish I had savored then more rather than stuffing my face. The kiwi sorbet was ok, I'd pass on it next time. Overall, great place, amazing food, and I can't wait to come back to try other dishes!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"2,"This restaurant actually deserves a five star rating. Â I have dined here three times and everything from front of house to waitstaff have been amazing. Â Tonight was an exception that warrants a two star rating. Understandably, our server was busy with a large party on the patio. Â However, the service did not improve after the party left. Â  She was very nice and amiable to the tables around us but frankly, very point blank with us. Â This was so obvious that I felt uncomfortable the whole time. Â In the beginning when taking our drink orders I asked if the bar could make a drink for me and I got the sense that I was hassling her even though she obliged. Â At the end when we got our check we had to wait around so long that we ended up paying with the hostess in the front. This is a five star restaurant that should have five star service to match. Â And it generally does, which is why I was very disappointed tonight. I understand that things happen but I couldn't help but feel we were given subpar to almost passive aggressive service. Â Although I love this restaurant, it makes me very hesitant to visit again or recommend it wholeheartedly.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"2,"Background: my husband and I went to dinner with his cousin and roommate. It was the first time I met them and the first time my husband has seen his cousin in over 10 years. We got the prefix but I am a vegetarian and needed my own dishes sometimes Minus 1: Their $9 focaccia has 2 tiny pieces Minus 1: Â for one of the pork plates- they brought me a separate plate but it looked like the three of them had to split 2 peoples portions because they only had 4 pieces of pork serves with 2 pieces on one side and 2 pieces on the other side. This same plate had 2 pieces of sausage to be split by 3 people!!Minus 1: their desserts were served on 2 plates for 4 people. And each plate had 3 tiny pieces of brownie. How the fuck are four people suppose to split 6 pieces of brownie?!?!SRV, learn math!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"4,"We had the arsenale tasting menu, and our meal went by in a tasty blur. The chicken with olives and a pasta course with snap-peas were standouts for me. The portions were generous, with two mains and two pasta courses following some delicious small bites. And in fact, we had to abandon the second pasta course midway through to preserve any room for dessert. Had a cocktail (""The Innocents Abroad"", if I'm not mixing that up), which was very good. Overall very nice.The service was friendly, though there was a bit of a delay early on before the meal got underway. And I'm not sure the setting quite clicked for me. Maybe the tables by the sliding doors feel a bit cut off when the back room is closed. Or maybe I just wasn't in the ideal state of mind at the time.The brunch menu looks very interesting, so I'll have to check that out some time.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"5,"Mamma Mia!! Â What a find! If you're looking for a fancy, white table cloth restaurant, this is not it; HOWEVER if you want authentic pasta and a warm welcome.... this is your place!!!!

It was a typical Italian kitchen. I felt that the marinara was out of this world. It really was a great tomato sauce over house made angel hair pasta. My other favorite was the homemade cannoli. It had the perfect balance in the filling.It's very convenient to go here. The shuttle from the Marriott Hotel-dropped us off and picked us up.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,This restraunt was an adorible small place with very personable servers. This place was truly amazing and was beyond my expectations!!! The taramasouw was to die for and I dont think I will ever find any better. We aren't even huge fans of coffee but this was amazing. Going here you can not get better food and service. True mom and pop restraunt. And,Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"4,"Tonight was busy and they squeezed us in without a reservation. I had The broccoli rabe, sausage, and fresh pasta (meh) and my wife had the penne, pancetta, and peas. She loved it, and the side of meatballs. I had to add salt and parm to get some taste out of it.

YMMV.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"4,"For when Rino's is busy - Mario's is a more casual, family restaurant that has friendly service and big portions. Go for their chicken parmesan - it comes with a salad (and bread). The waitresses will chat with you about the neighborhood and dish up delicious hot pasta. We like coming here with friends because it's a bit more private and low key than some other close by restaurant - and you never have to wait!",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"After a 5.5 hour flight and first time to Boston, found this place... And it was amazing!!! The servers are extremely nice and the food was delicious. We had 8 people and everyone finished their food!!!",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"Was in town and found this place from a referral from the hotel clerk. Â Amazing!!! Food, atmosphere and decent wine selection. Â  I will definitely come back when I'm in town again.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,Great food in local friendly place. We stopped on way home from the airport. Great attention to food allergies. We had seafood with home made pasta with garlic and olive oil. Fabulous,Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"One of the best Italian restaurants I have ever experience!We were staying in the Marriot near the airport and ended up Ubering here because the hotel restaurant had such terrible service. You have know idea how glad I was that the hotel had a terrible restaurant. Otherwise, we would have never found this gem!From entering the doors to waddling out, we felt welcomed and accepted into a family we didn't know we had. We were greeted by a nice woman that just felt like ""mom"" and helped out by her and her son, who felt like an older brother. We each ordered a glass of house Cab, nommed on the free bread, and then devoured two entrees and a dessert. The Fettuccini was homemade, noodles and sauce. There are no doubts in my mind that this was the best Fettuccini I have EVER had. The Chicken Parm was fresh with a breading that actually stuck to the chicken, unlike some that just flake off with the sauce. After cleaning every drop from our plates, we ventured onward to the heavenly Tiramisu. I won't describe this because I can't do it justice. Just order it.If you like a family that welcomes you into their home and feeds you, a scrumptious meal that leaves a lasting impression and memories that leave a desire to return just because, then you need to visit. Otherwise...I guess we can't be friends.Ciao!",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"First night in Boston and after checking out the reviews decided to try Mario's. What a great choice. Didn't have a reservation and was still able to get a seat thanks to the wonderful family that operates the restaurant. The food was spectacular. I had the homemade pasta with the bolognese sauce, salad, bread and of course an appetizer. I will go out of my way to come back to this restaurant.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"After a basketball tournament game and a Red Sox game, my daughter and I were looking for some great Italian in East Boston. There are several great choices in the area, but we went with Mario's because of the truly nice lady who answered the phone (Rino's didn't answer at all). When we got here (parking is horrendous) we were greeted by that sane nice lady who said it would be a few minutes. Â It is a small room and was packed with big, loud family tables. Like a communal Italian dining room for several families. Loud, boisterous and happy people all around.After our wait we were seated and the food started coming very quickly. Bread and butter, oil, parmesan and red pepper flakes. Cans of soda. Then an uninspired salad drenched in dressing made me question maybe we had made a mistake here... ...and then the veal and chicken parm came and everything was resolved. Spectacular. Crispy, delicious, covered in a truly fantastic sauce and great stretchy cheese, this rivals anything in the North End or Federal Hill in Providence. Â Ironically, the decent portions of the proteins and a small side of (really great) pasta in that sauce made this special. Fantastic. In lousy restaurants they give you lots of pasta, it's cheap, to distract you from the average food. This dinner is so good, you wouldn't really miss the pasta. But you'll want Â more because it's so good. Normally the unevenness of the first parts of the meal would take this review down a star. But the main dish was so great I'm staying with five stars. Try it. You'll love it.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,Came here for a quick bite and the food and service was amazing. I had the ravioli with meatballs. I usually don't eat meat but these meatballs were the best I have ever had. Absolutely delicious! Thank you,Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"We stumbled upon this little gem of a place because we initially were trying to go to another Italian restaurant nearby (won't name names) which doesn't take reservations and had a 1 hour wait!! We checked our phones to find something nearby and found Marios a short walk away with good reviews on Yelp - yay! So off we went. It is truly one of those little Mom and Pop neighborhood places where everyone knows your name. Â A good sign as we were entering the restaurant - a gentleman and his mother were leaving and highly recommended the food - they said they came by almost once every week. I asked the lady what her favorite dish was and she said everything's great.The interior as some of the photos show, takes you back in time a bit! The owner/chef Ursula was very nice and friendly. The other lady was also very nice. For appetizers we had - Burrata which was really nice and the melanzane (eggplant) which was good too. Entrees were - Veal Alla Ursula, Chicken Alla Ursula, Lobster ravioli, Lobster with linguine. All were really good. The alla ursula dishes are basically breaded meat and eggplant covered with marinara sauce. It was a lot of food especially after the bread and appetizers. Oh and every dish came with a side salad. The non-pasta dishes came with a side of pasta and sauce! Â For dessert we shared Tiramisu and gelato which was amazing!! Wow - I was so full and I had almost half my entree leftover!! Was glad to take home for lunch the next day lol.Ursula was super friendly, chatting us up, and I think she could tell we were not ""from the area"" regulars. She probably knows everyone that frequents this place! We stayed pretty much till the restaurant closed and as were all leaving outside, we saw her husband Mario drive up, and also chatted with him. Cute couple!! Would definitely recommend this homey place for good Italian food!!!",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"4,"The food here is really good. I haven't dined in, but I was really pleased with my takeout. I got a veal parmesan over pasta.When I arrived the attached treated me like family. I will be returning.

Â This is a wonderful, family-owned restaurant with terrific food and gracious service. Â The pasta is all home-made, and I had an amazing dish with pancetta, my husband had the ravioli. Â The staff makes you feel like you are in your own home, and let you know they appreciate you being there.

Â She makes an effort to visit and connect with every table. Â I had ursula dinner (chicken/eggplant parm), which was yummy and served with a small dish of ziti and a tangy tomato sauce. Â Everyone that came in the restaurant was from out of town - seemed to be people traveling through Logan airport - it was a little melting pot - people from Australia, business travelers from the midwest and those on their way to other places. Â A nice dining experience for an out of towner trying to get some local flavor :)",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"I struggle because all restaurants do not exist for the same reason. Some seek ""fine dining"", then fail, and receive my 2 or a 3 star notation for their lack of success in the race they chose, but were ill-equipped, to run.Others pose as authentic this-or-that, and dumb it down for the masses. See some of my reviews for ""Thai"" joints where advertised ""5"" level pepper heat hovers somewhere in the low 2's, or where ""chicken breast"" is touted as somehow superior to the fatty thigh.Mario's is not in that game. It isn't posing. It's just waiting there on the corner like a new friend when you come to the neighborhood. Â It's the mom-(literally, Ursula) and-pop neighborhood restaurant for locals and occasional visitors to a somewhat un-touristy East Boston. Some gentrification is underway, but the area around Mario's remains largely untouched by the ravages of new money and IKEA.Now, to the restaurant. Ursula and her able assistant greeted us quickly and friendly, and we were immediately seated. The wine list is quite good for its range; a $32 Malbec was very good, as was a $7 last glass of Chianti. My daughter's Bolognese was a true rendition of what Marcela Hazan teaches us to make: just enough fat, just enough roughness, not too much tomato, and white wine simmered in. The Bolognese was accompanied by perfect handmade pappardelle. My wife's veal with seafood and vegetables was quite good as well: nothing was skimped and everything, including tender green lip mussels and succulent clams and shrimp, were spot on. My shrimp scampi was wonderful - 8 large shrimp, salty like the sea, and handmade linguine in a perfect lemon garlic broth.You can't miss the tiramisu. Do save a bit of room for dessert, please?And if they have burrata, dive right in.Ursula said it best as she turned away a couple before closing. Â ""I'm so sorry, I've run out of food. I cook everything fresh every day, and I've just run out."" If she can't do it right, she just won't let her standards down.What could be improved upon? The bread could be a little crustier, a little fresher. The butter could be not in the little packets. But maybe you should just use olive oil, instead, as the bread is suited better to a soak than a spread. That's what I'll do next time, because I'm coming back for sure.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"Some colleagues and I are visiting town. We came into Mario's near closing time. Ursula was extremely accommodating and polite. She is a great host! To make things even better, the food is delicious. I will definitely return next time I am in town! Thank you so much!",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"A recommendation from our hotel. Our table had the papardelle bolognese, house special gnocchi, and chicken parm. Fantastic. A few at our table also had cannoli and Tira Misu - also fantastic.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"We found this place on accident. It looked like a nice place for lunch so we stopped. The atmosphere was great, quiet and homelike. The service was excellent, and the food was phenomenal. I was 1700 miles from Home but felt at home.

Next time I am in Boston I will certainly go black and eat again.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"5,"I was delighted to get a Nift card for this spot, and was not disappointed whatsoever in my experience!From the incredibly friendly and interesting bartenders (I've never seen a crew have so much fun together while also providing fast but thoughtful service) to the delicious food (I found the pizza here to be far fresher than the Kendall Square branch) to the oddball atmosphere (several smaller vintage black-and-white TVs and several inflatable mini-flamingos lining the bar), this is was a delight. Think Delux Cafe but with more breathing room, pizza, and takes cards!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"3,"Came here with my girl friend for a girls night out. The ambiance is casual and modern. Definitely a place suitable for families, couples, and friends. They can accommodate groups and it's appropriate to bring children. We had wine by the glass and that was reasonable. The appetizers were good though portions are small. Recommend one appetizer a person unless you are ok with ""small plate"" amounts of food. We got a half order of the pasta in meat sauce and that was about 4 bites, so don't get the half portion for any meal if you expect to be satisfied. That being said, the pasta is freshly made and the sauce was delicious. Just not sure if it was worth $15.We shared the mushroom sauce pizza with mushrooms on top (forgot the name). About 6 slices. Crust was thin and crispy with a slight chew and it was well made. The toppings were good and not too much cheese and thus not too greasy. We'd recommend the pizza for sure. We got a complimentary dessert when our bill arrived. It was a vanilla and chocolate pudding made in house that was thick and delicious! Very rich and the sprinkle of sea salt was a great touch. Service was friendly and attentive. Just wish they had a little more to pick from on the menu for dinner.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,I love this place. This is my second time here using a Nift certificate. It was pretty quiet when we arrived but it was filling up by the time we left. They have a great drink menu. There beer on tap had so many local favorites. We got the meat lovers pizza which was very delicious. You can easy share a pizza between two people. I haven't tried anything else but the pizza on the menu but they have a variety of different options here. I will definitely be back.,Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"5,The shakshuka was delicious but the real highlight to this establishment is their outstanding service.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Really good ambience, seating area. The pizzas are really authentic, wood fired.

Very nice place with good food and drinks, good for large groups.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Area Four is a blessing and a curse for me because I live so close to it. Can't decide on a brunch place? Great, I know where to go. All my favorite pizza delivery places are closed? Cool, I have a pretty good alternative. Convenience is key when it comes to my love affair with this place.I've ordered pizza twice from here and have been to brunch the same amount. Their pizza is good and of the artisan variety. Typically I need to be in the mood for that because it comes with a high sticker price, but their pizza is great. My favorite is the Carnivore, which is packed with Italian meats which bring it beyond your typical pepperoni pizza. Not my go-to when I'm craving classic, large pizzas, but Area Four knows what's up.As for brunch, this is really why I come here. I've been on two occasions, and I'm always satisfied. I've ordered the Hot Mess - which was a breakfast skillet sent from the gods Â - and the Hong Kong Waffle - which was basically dessert for brunch. Both were fantastic, and I'd jump at the chance to go again.Overall, great spot! Need to check them out for drinks soon. Darn. Guess I have to go back.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Stopped by for brunch/lunch on Saturday at around 11:15am. It wasn't too crowded since they open at 10:30, but it filled up quickly.They have a wide variety of drinks which is nice - interesting cocktails I haven't seen elsewhere. The brunch menu all looks delicious! I've also heard the pizzas are good and can be personal size or shared.I had the vegetable mess without cheese since I'm lactose intolerant, and they were very accommodating. That day the mess was served with a cranberry compote on top, which was delicious, and the tartness meshed with the natural sweetness of the vegetables and the richness of the egg. My friend had a lamb shakshuka which was special that day - it was really good and so was the pita bread that came with it. My other friend had the low country mess, which was great. The grits were deliciously cheesy and creamy.We ordered the fried apple on the side, which was fluffy and the right amount of sweet! The caramel sauce tasted a little bit alcoholic which went well with the fried batter and sour apple.It took a little while (30-40mins) to get our food, but our server was very nice.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,"I went to this restaurant based off a suggestion. They're known for their gourmet pizzas. Their pizzas and thin crust and don't have a lot of cheese (which is great!). The entire table got a variety of pizzas - sausage and banana peppers, sausage and lamb, mushroom, spinach and egg. I had a chance to try the sausage / banana peppers and the sausage / lamb pizzas. Between the two I preferred the sausage and banana peppers. It had a lot flavor and wasn't too spicy. I also had the small lamb tagliatelle which was delicious. I got the small plate and it was very small but the perfect size to also eat pizza. In addition their beer and cider selections are very good and all local.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"5,"This place is really good! If you come with a couple buddies and split a couple pizzas/sides, it's very fairly priced! The pizza here is great, probably the best I've ever had in Boston!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"3,"Four stars for the pizza and beer selection, three stars for a number of things. We've been here a couple times with a Nift, and a couple times without. Starting with the highs: there's a nice vibe, and some of their pizzas are really pretty amazing--loved the delicious carnivore, with lots of different types of flavorful meat. It had caraway seeds on the crust (yummm) and I'm pretty sure I tasted a little honey. Nice beers, too.And the lows: One frustration: the most recent time we wanted to use a nift, they said we had to be at the bar. From what I heard, a couple other surrounding tables had the same confusion since ""at the bar"" wasn't listed in the restrictions. If multiple people are making the same error, I would expect a classy institution to honor the ad and then change it to make it clearer in the future. The way it was handled just left a bad taste in our mouths. In general, we've had mixed service here--sometimes good, sometimes we've felt ignored. Coupled with somewhat mixed and sometimes overpriced food that isn't pizza (I'd skip the arancini; the flavors aren't as bold as you'd expect from sage and squash), my opinion is mixed, too.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,"It seems wrong to have area four (the name) outside of Cambridge. :)Great location, beautifully decorated, window let's in lots of sunshine.Good gluten free options - love that many egg dishes are made in their own cast iron pans. Friends loved their breakfast pizzas. Overall delicious. Fast service.And very accomodating to big groups (with reservation). The only negative is that they don't split checks, not even into 2 or 3 sub checks. Which is trouble for big groups or even when you're low on cash. But you can put in your card and specify amount to charge.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,"My boyfriend and I ate at the bar here on a Friday night. The hostess, waiters, and bartenders were all exceptionally nice!! As 5 year olds stuck in adult bodies, we loved that they had Connect Four and Simon Says games at the bar (they were off to the side and the bartender said we could help ourselves when we asked). What a fun way to wait for food!The ""crispy cheddar and hot honey"" snack was delicious. I'm still dreaming about it. For anyone who likes the idea of fried balls of sharp melty cheese with accents of sweet honey, I say go for it!!We also shared the mushroom pie. I found it a bit bland - I added red pepper flakes and black pepper to give it more flavor. I think it just wasn't salty enough for my taste. I think the Banh Mi pie would have been the smarter choice!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. I have been to the Kendall location before, but the brunch menu in the South End is larger.I made a reservation for 2 people at 11 AM and was seated right away even though my friend wasn't there yet.The food was crazy good! We split the cinnamon bun with caramel bacon frosting. Whooeee! Probably could have split with 4 people, but 2 was just fine...! It was moist and delicious with extra frosting siting on the tray for dipping. It wasn't too bacony or caramely. It still tasted like a cinnamon bun with ""something extra"". Would definitely get this again.I was thinking about getting the breakfast sandwich or a pizza for my entree, but wanted to do something different and went with the Low Country Mess. The promise of shrimp, grits and andoullie sausage was too much to pass up. I made one change to the dish by asking for fried eggs instead of over easy/runny. The first time they brought it out, they forgot my fried egg request, but were very quick to bring me a new one.The dish was very good! There were 3 or 4 large shrimp, the sausage was nice and spicy and the saffron broth gave a great flavor and texture to the grits without drowning them. I was very happy with my choice.The server was a bit spacey and kept saying he would bring water and then forgetting. No biggie. It didn't mar my overall experience at all. I will definitely be back!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"4,"I've come here twice, with a group of friends both times, and have come to the conclusion that I'll always leave here hungry. Ok maybe not hungry, but to be full, it would cost me way more than I'd like to spend at a pizza joint. My assumption is the price has to be higher due to the area.Fact #1: the food is delicious. We enjoyed everything we ordered during our last visit for brunch. The fried apples are so good, I could easily eat three plates of them. The pizzas are the main reason I return. The dough has a great char and just the right amount of chewiness. I've had the margarita, breakfast pizza, Florentine, and meat lover's and enjoyed them all equally. Fact #2: the portions are small and kinda overpriced. The pizzas are about $16-18 each and I can easily finish one by myself with room for more food. Each of the brunch entrees were about the size of a small appetizer plate. They did give us complimentary dessert in the form of little jars of chocolate pudding, boosting the Yelp review to four stars.Would I recommend this place? Yes, if you're craving great pizzas at a premium price.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"5,"I would eat here everyday if I could but it's not figure friendly. I love it here.

Pizza was nicely crisped, but any banh mi flavoring was lost in the orange (?) sauce drizzled liberally over the entire pizza.

I have been to the one in Cambridge a few times for brunch and dinner, and when I found out this place opened, I had to check it out!I came here for dinner and brunch as well and I was impressed! This interior is slightly different compared to the one in Cambridge. This one is more open and spacious. They have an open kitchen and interesting decor. I tried their shiitake mushroom and fontina pizza, carnivore pizza, sausage and banana peppers pizza, Hong Kong waffle, the hot mess, and breakfast pizza. All of the food I have tried here is delicious! I really enjoyed the Hong Kong waffle for brunch. I normally don't get a sweet dish for brunch, but when I saw that on the menu, I had to try it out. First things first, they got the batter down. It was fluffy and sweet and I love biting into the ""little eggies!"" And it really hit home to me when they topped it off with ice cream.

Friendly service and good music, in general great atmosphere.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Came here for restaurant week and ordered from the prefix menu (which had a large selection and was a great deal). The ambiance and atmosphere is just as how it looks in the pictures~ very warm, elegant, and cozy. Service is good~ nothing super spectacular but our waiter was friendly and attentive. The restaurant is located in a central part of Boston, close to Copley, which is really convenient. If you're driving, be sure to park at the garage on Clarendon St~ they validate and it's only $5! It's a little bit of a walk, but for $5 it's worth it. As for the food, I was not disappointed. The reviews on yelp were high so I expected a good meal. For the appetizer I ordered these fried risotto balls. It comes with two. SO filling! The inside had mozzarella too so you can imagine how heavy this was. Nonetheless, it was delicious!! I don't know how I had room for my entree but I ordered the bolognese which apparently is one of their most popular dishes. Everything about it was great~ the sauce, the meat, the pasta itself. Definitely can see why people love it. As I was just about keeled over, my tiramisu for dessert came. I'm a huge dessert person and this cake was so decadent. Even though I was stuffed beyond belief, I had to finish it! I would definitely recommend all three things that I ordered and would recommend this restaurant as a whole too.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"I am Italian with deep roots and much pasta experience and am a fan of unique pasta and ambiance and have been to several Italian restaurants in Boston, NYC and in Rome. I've searched high and low for the kind of unique pasta that Da Vinci offers. I had the gnocchi with simmered wild mushrooms, butter and shaved parmiggiano. Best dish I've ever tasted in my life - truly! Also served with taglielle. Lamb chop is spectacular. Amazing wine list! Creme brulee is everything one would hope it to be. And the best salad I adored! What I like about each dish is the little details of flavors you wouldn't expect that simply cannot be found everywhere. Like the sprinkling of scallions on top of the pasta and flavored olive oil. Fennel with the beet salad and mango chutney. I cannot get over these dishes!The ambiance is beautiful and romantic with dim lighting, laid back, Â intimate, with light jazz in the background and candle lit tables. I can see that it's the perfect place for a date or a special occasion for that special someone in your life.  And the staff are so friendly and attentive almost like you're guests in someone's house. Excellent service! They really take care of you making every moment pleasant and comfortable, catering to your every need. They truly love to serve here! Definitely one not to miss! I can't wait to tell my friends to try! This place is on another level in every category.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"2,"When we first walked in liked the look, easy walk from Taj (old Ritz) and nice Italian music songs on sound system. We we're 2nd group in at 6:30. Service slow, (many seved before us after we sat) and before we left Incubus music ( awful) during meal. Meal... Not worth it, looked ok on line, but not good meal. Indian Rav..not good, mussels, a Â 2, lamb chops a 2.9 liked the potatoes it came with. Chicken Parm, 2.5... not served with any Veg's taste pretty cafeteria. Salad dressing ?? Also not crisp. Wine a 5 had a Valopicella, good value good taste. Waiter introduced Vegetarian plates as , well whatever the fish was and other things including one meat dish, oppppss. Never going back.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Sat at the bar cuz reservation was for one. How convenient when you are single. Dave the bartender was very nice. gin-tonic has a full layer of basil, just what I liked. Tried the Boston Globe rated No.1 Bolognese, they wasn't lying. Very satisfied. The tiramisu was so good I finished my dessert the first time in years. Valet was nice too",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"FANTASTIC. Amazing food and incredible service. I had the calamari, the arancini, and the veal. All superb. If you're looking for a restaurant with great food and ambience, you've found it.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"We were told about the indian masala ravioli that the chef prepares here and we knew we had to try it out! I had never thought about fusing curry leaves with pasta sauce and the first bite threw me off, but it was delicious! I might actually have to try to emulate it at home...or we can make a trip to Boston once in a while...",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"I've been wanting to come here for years and finally came in on a quiet night, it picked up later but I had my pick of seats. I ordered the gluten free pasta with bolognese sauce, it was great. I ate it all. If you know me at all I rarely order a glutinous plate of pasta without a side of greens and bring home half the starch but it was worth the carb overload. Â The sauce was fantastic and the gluten free pasta perfect.The true surprise of the night was the gluten free chocolate soufflÃ© with vanilla gelato. I was ambivalent about the order but the bartender suggested it so a complied. Thank the heavens above I did because I ate it all! I honestly don't remember the last time I went out to eat and had such a nice surprise. The staff were awesome and the environment quiet yet lively. My thoughts still return to the rack of lamb they had on the menu and some of the other plates. Would definitely recommend going and I will be returning with friends.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Shocked by the ups and downs in the review for Da Vinci because when I had an amazing meal there during Dine Out Boston. The service, the food, the atmosphere are wonderful at Da Vinci's. The standard menu is pretty pricey but if you go for Dine Out, it's quite a steal at $38 for 3 courses AND they have Dine Out Wine Specials so my friend and I split a bottle of red for something like $29.Foremost, they give you this amazing bread to start and you're served a mashed garlic chickpea dip and basil infused olive oil. Unbelievable both dips, I could've been happy filling up on this and bread alone.I ordered Arancini for my primi and they were heaven in a fried risotto fried rice ball. The outside was perfectly crisp and the tomato confit sauce with it was amazing. My only gripe was that I wish there was more sauce for me to dip the Arancini in as there was just a swipe of it across the bottom of the plate.For the secondi, I got the Gnocchi Crema di Zucchine and this was so frickin' good. Unreal potato dumplings which our waiter told us all pastas are made in-house. The zucchini flavor was lightly infused in the Parmiggiano cream sauce.Finally for my dolci, I got the Tiramisu al Pistacchio. The pistachio cream was amazing. Definitely had a little more creme brÃ»lÃ©e texture than standard cheesecake, but nonetheless a tasty treat.Overall, Da Vinci has made my list as one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Boston and I would definitely return again. Understandably it is pretty pricey but even with Dine Out portions (typically smaller than if you paid full price), I still had enough gnocchi leftover for another meal.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"2,"We came here tonight for Dine out Boston (restaurant week) and I was excited to get some house made pasta. As a table, we order the arancini and pomodoro e mozzerella. It was all okay, with the arancini the best in taste but the homemade mozz was meh.For the entrees, we got the sirloin, gnocchi, orrechiette, and tagliatelle. Sirloin was salty, tagliatelle was solid, and the gnocchi was tougher than what homemade gnocchi normally taste like. overall, I had high hopes, especially since everything looked so good. But again, the entree were just meh.For dessert we got the creme brulee, mango mousse, and tirmisu. The creme brulee certainly tasted like it was not freshly torched and came straight from the fridge. Mango mouse was solid, but mine has no berries on it as it read on the menu.Overall, I hope the reason the dinner was not the best was just that they prepared a lot en masse for restaurant week, but regardless they did not do well marketing the food for me to come back again. It's too bad because I really love great pasta, and they just didn't have great pasta tonight. :(",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"3,"Went for Valentine's Day Prix Fixe menu. It was around $90-$100 per person. Cancelling the reservation was almost not allowed as we would be charged $80 per person. It was an OK meal. The appetizers were a combination of different starters. They weren't too magnificent or too bad. I got the black trumpet gnocchi for the pasta. Then the lamb for the meats. Personally, I found the portions too large. Even for my boyfriend, who has a big appetite, the portions were too large. We had a hard time eating the lamb. By the time we got to the dessert, we really couldn't eat anymore. I wish they could control their portions a little more for the prix fixe menu. Personally, Da Vinci was a little underwhelming. We were expected better ambiance and quality/well-portioned food. However, the place was a bit crowded and the inside interior not as great. We needed up being way too full in the end, not knowing whether we enjoyed the meal or not.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"Da Vinci's is a deliciously authentic Italian resturant in Boston that's not located in the North End.Have only been here once but was impressed with the overall ambiance, service, and professional touch this resturant evoked. Came here for a date, and place was the perfect setting. And if you like larger parties, there was a table of 14 sitting right behind us(company outing I presume).Can't remember what my gf had for dinner, but I ordered the bolognese as I do at most Italian restaurants I visit to see if it compares to the bolognese id get from a local aperitivo in Firenze. The bolognese was good, but nothing spectacular. That said it was authentic, and the rest of our appetizers were delicious.I would definitely come back and recommend for anyone looking for good Italian food outside of the crowded, overpriced north end.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"The misses and I went to Da Vinci's after Wine Riot because we were drunk... We came in 30 minutes before the place close. I asked them were the kitchen closed because I could see the guy in the back cleaning up. Â The guy said no and he seated us. Even though the place was near closing we still got exceptional service. Â The misses had lamb and I had gnocchi. The misses said her lamb was amazing. My gnocchi was pretty good! I never had it with mushrooms but it was a nice touch. Overall the place was good, it's a little pricey but what you expect on a Saturday in Boston? Â I will be back.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"I'm across the street from this place, but I never noticed Da Vinci until I was invited to a birthday dinner there. I didn't know what to expect from the restaurant at all, and it was well worth the surprise. The ambiance is romantic. Dark setting with glow up menus (like the da Vinci code) that would probably impress your date. The menu is signature, making it difficult for a foodie to decide what to order. I ended up getting the duck confit cooked two days, and I did not regret my decision at all. The duck was perfectly seared and the flavor balance was really nice. I usually hunk restaurants over-salt their dishes, but this restaurants seasoning was spot on!My only opportunity for the restaurant is their service. Attentiveness: 9/10. However, when I asked for what kind of wine would pair well with my dish, the server was sassy and not helpful. When we tasted the wines and I said I prefer the slightly cheaper one, he scoffed as if that were offensive. Our table had 5 or 6 bottles of wine all together, so I was kind of nerved by his condescending demeanor. I honestly don't think he knew what he was talking about.Tip: don't ask for wine advice. Didn't seem to be the forte. BUT the chef rocks and makes up for any of it.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"3,"Uhhh. Came here for Boston dine out. To start ordered the arancini which was good, but more like fried mozz.  Â  Â  Â  Second had the sausage and ear shaped pasta dish.... Here is where it gets bad. The pasta was very good,but the sausage was flavorless and overall dish was very bland and the chef must have a heavy hand on salt. Had to drink about 3 glasses of water after.  Â  Â  Â  For dessert I order the creme brulee, which was great! Â  Â  Â  Last the service. I had the bartender as my server who was nice but very unfrequently came to the table. I also sat for a while waigting for my food and finally my check. Once the check came I paid with cash and expected change back but instead the bartender took all of my cash as a tip. Service was not good at all!! Overall DaVinci's is your average Italian restaurant with prices that are too high for the food they put out. P.s the front hostess saved my experience. She was very friendly asked how my dinner was, when I told her it was ok she took the time to ask why and even recommend other dishes!",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"2,"Wtf Yelpers? Wow I'm not sure how this got rated so high. The place has a typical downtown feel, business lunch or client dinner but no real ambiance.The tomato and burrata was ok, tomato was not ripe or sweet, burrata was excellent though.The scallops were rubbery, not fresh and the entire dish was poorly executed, risotto was salty.The pasta was thick and undercooked, sauce was ok.Very dissatisfied with the entire experience.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Celebrated our anniversary there. The waiters were really kind, considerate and patient. The food was very particularly well made. A very interesting menu of some fusions. The serving size is HUGE. One antipasti, one secondi, and one dolce should be enough for two people. Da Vinci serves the most authentic espresso and it comes with almond biscotti. This is the best Italian thing I've tasted since my last visit to Italy. The environment was also really friendly and relaxing while it has a good standard.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Go here. Don't hesitate. That is all.Ok, a bit more. Wow, the Masala Ravioli is one of the most unique and delicious dishes I have ever had. Anywhere, on the planet. That's what my wife ordered. I had the Chicken Parm. Also one of the best. Nice atmosphere, superb food, great service. Da Vinci is an absolute winner and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Da Vinci is a nice intimate little place. Great for dates! My boyfriend and I spent 2 Valentines here and both times were wonderful experiences. I love their Valentine's Day prefixed menus, very reasonably priced for 2. I don't remember what I had last year but the food options for this year was plentiful! We had bread and 2 rounds of appetizers and got pretty full even before the entrees arrived! But we plowed through and of course ate and enjoyed everything. We're animals. They had great dessert options this year! Chocolate covered strawberries, tiramisu, AND creme brÃ»lÃ©e! *sigh dreamily* To top it off, the server gave us (ME!) a rose along with the check for Valentine's Day! They sure know how to make you feel special!",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"We had a great experience at Da Vinci! I've been to a lot of restaurants around Back Bay as I've worked in the immediate area for 3+ years, yet I hadn't hear of Da Vinci. I love the fact that this place has outside seating, that's a huge plus for me especially when the weather is beautiful (which has been rare so far this summer with all the rain), so when the weather is great I take full advantage of it. The food was excellent and the service was superb! When my friends and I go to dinner we take our time and typically spend a few hours (approximately 3 hours - I know crazy) so we don't like being harassed every 5 minutes and asked if we need anything else. We had a great time and I will definitely be back.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"2,This place is all frills. It's very dark which is probably an attempt to make it fancy and to see the light up menus. The food is EXTREMELY overpriced and nothing special. Pour masala sauce over ravioli at home and get the same thing. I was looking forward to this so it was very disappointing. Service was okay.,Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Hidden gem in Southie. Publico is a beautiful restaurant a few blocks away from the busy W Broadway. I came here with a few people on Sunday for brunch and it was a wonderful treat.There are tables inside, a U-shaped bar, and a few tables in this swanky, courtyard areaThe courtyard area is awesome. There is a retractable tarp/roof and heated lamps for the cold days We opted for the courtyard since it was nice out.I had the Bloody Mary and my bf had the Irish Breakfast for drinks. They were delicious! For appetizers, we had the bag of beignets and the papitas. The beignets were shaped like footballs. More crunchy than soft but I enjoyed it especially with the chocolate dipping sauce. The papitas were a nice fork tender and the creme fraiche was a wonderful compliment.For entrees, I had the special which was a Lobster Benedict (on a biscuit). My bf got the baked frittata (sub goat cheese for mozzarella). My sister had the arugula salad with steak and her bf had the Pop's steak and eggs. The lobster benedict was everything I hoped for an more. The eggs were beautifully poached. There was a good amount of lobster and the biscuit was buttery and soft. Needless to say, I inhaled it all. It came with potatoes as a side which were good but since I had that as an appetizer, I didn't eat it all. Had I known, I would have had salad as a side. My bf loved his frittata. He ate all of it. My sister enjoyed her salad as well though the steak was rarer than she would have preferred (medium rare). Her bf liked his steak and eggs.Overall, we had a great experience. I will definitely be back again. I am intrigued to see what Publico is like at night due to the booth set up in the courtyard. This could be a good hangout/drink spot.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"4,"What a pleasant surprise!While in Boston seaport district, We were trying to Find something a little different and we were very happy with our choice of Publico. We took an Uber there and when they dropped us off it was a little strange it seems like it was in the middle of nowhere. We were there on a Sunday around 5 o'clock and it was a little bit dead and the atmosphere was very lacking at that time. We sat in the courtyard which is not really outside but it felt like it was. Our waitress was very friendly and do the menu very well. It was a nice mix of food and some of the things on the menu we really had no idea what they were so we were a bit adventurous. We started out with a special that was ceviche. It was fantastic! Very light and cooked perfectly. We also got grilled beets, Which were very juicy and we're on a nice bed of salad. I ordered the steak frites and I would absolutely recommend this if you are a steak eater. The steak pretty much melted in your mouth. Â My boyfriend got the roasted pork short ribs which had amazing flavor but if you don't like the texture of the bone and the fatty parts, You will not like this. The white beans that came with it were fantastic. My friend that I was with ordered the grilled trumpet mushrooms, This was a very large plate and We would definitely recommend this Â for any vegetarian. There was a ton of quinoa that came with this and the squash was very good as well. After dinner, we asked if they could make Mexican coffee and the bartender was very happy to accommodate us. It was a little out of the way of anything, but if you go to Lawn on D, it is like a 10 min walk and fun to stop at prior.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"5,"So much fun.We came here on a Saturday evening, made a reservation and were seated right away. Service was wonderful. They were super attentive and quick and answered all our questions. Most of my table got the lobster mac and cheese which is quiet large even though its on the app side. I got the Baja Fish tacos which were soo good. One of the better fish tacos I've had. They also have a number of Gluten Free items and vegan items. The drinks were very tasty.

Beautiful set up inside with plenty of space and wall art. Service was friendly and prompt. We had ceviche which was fresh and delicious, mais crepes (messy but very flavorful), and octopus. Overall, I'll come back to try other things on their menu and recommend trying this restaurant at least once!",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"3,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. It wasn't a bad experience. The atmosphere was actually pretty cool and service was good, but the portions were small and the food was overpriced and alright at best. Nothing special. My husband and I shared the burger and short ribs, and for a $17 burger and $26 plate it definitely wasn't worth it. It is nice that they have private rooms for large parties. I called to see if I could reserve one on a different occasion, but the minimum to book the room was ridiculous so I opted out. I'm realizing all these new restaurants that are popping up in Southie are trendy, but not super substantial.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"5,"I love every dish we ordered! Ceviche- fish and shrimp was generous and fresh!Steamed mussels- sauce with albarino, romesco was flavorful and garlickyMais crepes - melt in my mouth !

Jack talk thai - so refreshing and not skimp on the grey goose",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"5,"Such a cute brunch place. We made reservations beforehand and receive the high tables in the center of the courtyard-like room under the greenery. It was empty enough on a Sunday at noon that we would have been seated regardless, but probably not at the nicer high tables. Our table ordered the breakfast for champions which is a huge bottle of champagne and three fruit purees to mix your own mimosa. I thought that was pretty fun.The only fault: I ordered the ceviche and Russian Spy Bloody Mary which I didn't think was super special. If this were a restaurant in New York, probably would have given it 4 stars. I gave 5 stars for helping Boston become a bit trendier lol.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"4,"great spot for groups! there are tons of food options on the menu that appeal to a lot of tastes, plus there is a great side lounge area with couches that i believe opens outdoors in the summer.we started with the tartare taco, grilled octopus, and ceviche. all were so delicious, and i especially liked the pulpo, there was plenty of meat and it was fresh with great texture. this actually applies to all the dishes.i got a pizza for my entree which ended up being a great shareable dish. across the table we tried the lobster mac and cheese, chicarrones, and a whole bunch of other dishes that were all really good. i don't think there is a wrong choice, and like i said there are easy options for those that are picky, plus interesting dishes for the more adventurous.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"5,"First time here and I absolutely loved this place! Went here on a Saturday night around 6:30pm, sat on their patio! Great host who sat us, extremely friendly! Server came right over and poured us water! I ordered a Rose by the glass, my husband a Cisco Summer Ale! We weren't all that hungry, but order Brussels sprouts to start [delish] and split the Steak Frites [excellent]! I had a delicious Pinot Noir with the Steak! We then strolled over to their very comfy sofa furniture to watch the Red Sox and their fire pit!!! Yes I know , awesome right?? Lol!! You have to check this place out! And, they also play this house music that makes you want to get up and dance! Excellent food and service, what more can you ask for???",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"4,"I fell in love with the restaurant the moment I walked inside. It feels as though theres 3 different themes going on inside: a unique dining areas that gives off Latin vibes, a modern city bar, and the beautiful urban garden in the back of the restaurant. Not going to lie, I really wanted to come here for the garden. Note that the garden is first come first served!The food is a mix of Latin, European and American. We tried all the snacks: sourdough buns, bacalao fritters, empanadas, tacos, and perrito caliente. I loved the perrito caliente, hotdog on soft warm buns garnished with chili, salsa, bacon bits and drizzled over with a light mayo. As simple as this sounds, it was really good. The empanadas and bacalao fritters (cod fritters) are also good and worth ordering. I would skip the sourdough buns and tacos since they were very plain/unoriginal.My favorites had to be the ceviche and mais crepes (corn crepes). The ceviche was one of the best I've ever had and worth every penny! The seafood was fresh and light yet seasoned perfectly. The mais crepes was very unique, I love the sweetness of the corn mixed the sharp and tart flavors from the radish and relish. The only downside to the crepes is that it is very mushy in texture and if you don't like that, this may not appeal to you. Steamed mussels, bolognese, and steak frites were all very boring and not impressive at all so I don't recommend any of these. Drinks were okay; their cocktails feature not so well known liquors so everything sounded interesting. I tried the luchador and I would recommend that to anyone who likes light and refreshing drinks. Similar to a mojito but with ginger.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"5,New restaurant that recently opened up in the area. Large dining area with plenty of tables and chairs. The other room is an enclosed outdoor area perfect for warm Boston days. This place filled up quickly right after we got there so I suggest making a reservation. Besides their short water glasses which would need a refill every 2 minutes; the meal was perfect. The Ceviche was excellent and the Mahi Mahi's sauce was A-mazing! The giant pieces of corn threw me off but they were pretty delicious. The brussel sprouts were baked well too. The pieces of chopped pork gave it that extra flavor.,Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"5,"I love this hidden southie gem. I'm a regular here for brunch. Brunch being my favorite meal, I've tried brunches all over this city. Publico is my favorite! Get the eggs Benny, you won't be disappointed. Awesome drinks, great food!",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"4,"First impression is the space is beautiful, inside and out. I personally like that it's not on the main street which makes it more special and unique. The restaurant is connected to a luxury apartment building, which is super convenient for residents so they can enjoy the outdoor patio area in the middle of the restaurant with the fire pits, and an outdoor bar which will be a great spot when it warms up. If not, there's still a large bar in the inside of the restaurant. That being said, the bar is in one section, and on the other side are the majority of the tables and the lighting got increasingly darker which I think ended up being a little too dark towards the end since I couldn't really see my food lol.We came the Friday of opening week with an early reservation, and the place was completely packed within an hour and a half. Some new opening kinks were definitely noticeable. I felt like our waitress could have been more attentive since in our party of four, two showed up much later and even though we were asked about drinks in the very beginning, we wanted to order an app to get started and we had to wait a bit.Drinks were absolutely delicious, I got the Vicero that came with pisco, and it's a little on the smaller side but very tasty. I really enjoyed the Lucador too that had a fresh, cucumber flavor but the hint of ginger really made it unique.For food, we got the tacos to start as apps, and these came with tartare and on the tinier side, but the two that were served had a decent amount of tartare. We also got the pollo asado which was extremely tender and the flavor was just right! The options reminded me of authentic latino food, although their menu is considered ""global latino and european food"" I definitely preferred the ones with more latino influence. It seemed like a lot of people ordered the steak frites and that entree was huge. Not sure about the taste, but in terms of size, that entree seemed worth the price. We also got grilled trumpet mushrooms, great vegetarian option!",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"5,"I love Publico!

The interesting thing about this place though is that they do have Italian and Brazilian items on the menu as well, which I have yet to try. This time I ordered the waffle with added chocolate chips. The waffle is lightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, PERFECT! I got a side of home fries, which is a VERY generous amount. I also had an iced coffee. My friend and I were seated at the counter by the window. It is a very tiny place, a little crammed, but it didn't ruin my experience at all.",Theo's Cozy Corner,"162 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"3,Arrived to Boston and decided to check out this place for breakfast based on the high reviews. I wasn't overly impressed with this place despite this. It's a small restaurant with limited seating and I felt like it wasn't worth the wait. Ordered the omelet and a side of pancakes. The pancakes looked golden and fluffy and I was really excited to try it but it came as a disappointment. I've had better breakfast elsewhere and most likely will not return. The benefit to this place is that they sell lunch and dinner items during breakfast time if you're willing to wait. My friend got a pasta dish but he said it wasn't that great and probably wouldn't get it again.,Theo's Cozy Corner,"162 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Breakfast is the bomb. They give you so much food, you can't finish, at a very reasonable price. Not much seating, though.",Theo's Cozy Corner,"162 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Cash only. But there's an ATM around the corner.Very small space but ""cozy"". We were very lucky that there was a table open right when we got in. Otherwise, we might've waited 10 minutes or so, which still isn't particularly bad. Staff is friendly and service is quick. I had an omelette and toast and my boyfriend had the turkey club. My omelette was delicious but I didn't particularly like the type of mushrooms they used. The toast was great as well but didn't seem to be well-buttered; only in certain spots. The turkey club was apparently delicious as well.It's a very no-frills place and I quite enjoyed my visit there. Would stop by again if I was ever in the area and feeling hungry but would probably not make a trip to the North End just for that.",Theo's Cozy Corner,"162 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Ok, it is ""cozy"", but it's also worth it! The burgers were great with plenty of perfectly cooked bacon. The turkey sandwich had a ton of meat and the meatball sub was delicious. Â  Prices were fair and the atmosphere great.",Theo's Cozy Corner,"162 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"4,"One of my favorite lcal hole in the wall finds that we almost overlooked on our trip. The food is definitely clasic diner style, with breakfast (their specialty) being served all day. The waitress was friendly and attentative without being overbearing, and our sandwiches (chicken salad on wheat and the terriyaki sub) were both filling and tasty. Very reasonable price and generous portions. Was fun to see that the clientele was made up of people who lived nearby in the primarily Italian neighborhood. They all waved and yelled hello to a police officer who rolled up in his patrol car, who parked and came in post shift just to see his buddies. Worth it for the ambiance and non-tourist trap vibes.",Theo's Cozy Corner,"162 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"As you walk in the door you are greeted by smilies and a warm welcome.

We stopped in for breakfast on a Monday morning right after flying into Boston. It's a small place without many tables but it's definitely worth it even if you have to wait a few minutes.

We came to Boston to attend the Eagles concert, stayed at the Onyx and wanted a casual breakfast walking distance from the hotel. We checked Yelp and found Theo's. Once there we could sense why the place has such great reviews. The food was great, and service terrific.

However, finding a breakfast spot that is open at 6 am can prove quite challenging, especially if you don't want to drive too far from the airport. Theo's is a small Italian joint that is open at the crack of dawn, and they are a great spot to satiate your early morning breakfast hankering.You know things are going to be good when you open the door and are intoxicated by the smell of fresh roasting seasoned home fries. Â There are a lot of great options on the menu, but I highly recommend the Hot Italian Sausage and Provolone Cheese omelet. The omelet itself takes up the entire plate's width one way and essentially fills up half of a plate. It is chock full of delicious sausage and melted provolone. It comes with a very hearty serving of the aforementioned home fries, which have a fabulous flavor and a nice mix of soft and crispy textures. You also get your choice of toast, and I generally go with raisin (though they have quite a few options).The place is small, and I imagine it gets quite busy as the morning creeps into normal breakfast hours. Even at the early hour we arrived, there were quite a few folks who began filing in. The service is lightweight but fine, and the food comes out reasonably fast. They do serve lunch, and the options there are decidedly more Italian, but I have never ventured there for anything other than an early morning breakfast. However, if an early morning breakfast is what you desire, then Theo's is an amazing choice. Make sure you bring cash, though, as they don't accept plastic.",Theo's Cozy Corner,"162 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Great breakfast spot in a nice ""cozy"" setting. Service was prompt once seated.

Â I came here after work for an early dinner and it was wonderful.I started with 6 oysters for the buck a shuck deal. They were real good. Not too Briney. Nice and meaty. I should have asked what kind they were.For entrees, I got the Cuban sandwich but subbed out the fries with a Caesar salad. My bf got the pulled pork tacos. The Cuban was massive. It was really good. Crunchy bread. Tender and flavorful pork. A little spice from the mustard. I wish it had more pickles though. It needed more acid. My bf devoured his tacos. He said the apple slaw was incredible.For dessert, we shared a chocolate lava cake. It was a decent size! About a fist size big. It was warm and gooey though no ""lava"" poured out. I would still order it again.Overall, I had a great experience here. The server was attentive and the busboy as well. He constantly filled our waters. If you can, sit by the kitchen counter.

It was humid-less summer afternoon so I took the opportunity to take my friends to Redd's for dinner and drinks out on their patio. To our surprise, the gate was locked and chairs were stacked on top of tables. Apparently, Redd's is only open on Sundays for brunch and closes after 3p. My friends were hangry and looked to me to rectify this situation and I did just that when I opened my handy dandy Yelp app to find this ""hot new restaurant."" 753 South has an equally cute of a patio dining area as Redd's with dangling string lights and all. Food was fantastic too. I wasn't too hungry so I didn't get the brick chicken the other reviews mention. Instead I ordered the Cuban sandwich. The Cuban was slightly oily but the flavors were just right. Plus, I loved that there was plenty of pickles inside the sandwich and on the side! My friends got the burger and the walnut apple salad and both really liked their food. In fact, my eyes kept wandering to other tables because all the food looked so good!

The atmosphere is relaxed and modern and the service was really excellent. We ordered several cocktails from their menu and off menu, I can't really recommend any of them. They we fine but weak and nothing to write home, or yelp about. Go for the food, not the drinks. The food was is where it is AT. We had the Thai chili wings to start, really yummy and I loved the pickled jalapeÃ±os. Next we had the steak tips, chicken under and brick, Cuban, and the salmon. By far, the best was the chicken under a brick, it was outstanding. The steak tips were huge and delicious. The salmon was fine but not very exciting and the Cuban was just ok.

It did not disappoint. It was the perfect comfort food I needed after a busy day at work. The fry on the oysters was done well, and the side of fries definitely pleased. The cornbread, however, was the real gem here. It packed a lot flavor, had the perfect texture - good crust on the outside and a soft inside - and the melted butter on top made it some of the best cornbread I have eaten.

We had the chips and guac for an app - chips were hearty and fresh and the guac tasted house made. I had the BBQ Pork Tacos for my entree which was a huge portion and very tasty.

I loved the set up, they fit so many tables in there but there are section dividers so you're not on top of everyone all the time, you really feel like you're having an intimate meal.The food of course was delicious. My absolute favorite was the salmon on fire appetizer - fresh salmon roasts over open flames on a bamboo rod, and you get to pick how long it cooks by blowing out the flame. Absolutely the best presentation of the night and tasted as good as it looked!All of the rolls we tried were delicious, but fair warning they're pretty sizable. I was expecting 6 pieces but most rolls had at least 8 or 12 pieces - come hungry!Dessert was delicious as well - I tried the red bean creme brulee and it was well worth it.All in all Oishii is a fantastic restaurant and I can't wait to go back!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in boston. The sushi and sashimi is very fresh, the service is amazing. and the not only is the presentation superb but so is the taste. Sushi: I usually get a few pieces of sushi and sashimi ala carte - salmon belly, baby yellowtail,tuna belly. i also recommend a toro truffle roll (recommend to hold the truffle oil as it can get a little salty). When you order otoro or uni sashimi, sometimes they sprinkle gold flakes on your order to spice up the presentation!Appetizers: If you're on a date and want a wow factor, the tuna tartare comes in a block of ice and the salmon on fire really puts on a show. to take it over the top, the wagyu hot stone will be a unique experience in itself.Meat: As for hot dishes/main courses, the teriyaki steak has a generous portion when compared to most japanese dish sizes. its very tender and full of flavor. If you want to splurge, I'd recommend the A5 wagyu to share - eating one alone is possible but the meat is super rich and you may get tired of it after a few bites.Fish: They used to have an otoro rissoto that was my favorite dish. the chilean sea bass is pretty good, as well as the miso yaki (black cod).",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,One of the best meals I've had in Boston! Â We decided to impromptu treat ourselves last night. Don't let the open table reservations scare you - I called and they said there was plenty of seating in the lounge and sushi area. We started with some delicious miso soup. There was so much flavor packed in and some of the best I've had. We got the Wagyu beef tartar. It was pretty good. I don't think it was as amazing as I was expecting. It did taste a lot of sour cream and onion chips which was surprising. The quail egg was beautiful on top. Â We also had the king crab dumplings. There were only two dumplings which surprised me for a $12 dish. The broth the dumplings sat in was sooo delicious. I wanted to slurp it all up. Make sure to take a bite of the dumpling and go back to dip it in the broth for the next one. There was a good amount of crab. It was very delicious. We got three maki. The torched was our favorite by far. Very creamy and a delicious and surprising amount of scallop on top. The white tiger was very good. The sauce was delicious. The wasabi could have been a little stronger. I kept having to add more and more. Then we finished with the king salmon roll. It was also very good with a lot of tobiko inside. We finished our meal with the squid ink pasta. I'm very glad we got this even though we were very full. It was so buttery and delicious. The calamari was very plump and had been marinated in gorgeous buttery and garlic flavors. This pasta and the torched roll were by far my favorite parts.,Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Incredibly expensive but worth at least... one trip. We got a handful of dishes, ranging from the coconut sphere for desert, some sashimi and some of the maki. The pork belly was probably some of the most fatty pork belly I've ever had, but wow it was amazing. I'd highly recommend if you're a fan of pork belly.The coconut sphere was fantastic, I was hesitant to get it as we were both full, and I'm not a huge fan of deserts, but it was an explosion of flavor when you eat the entire piece in one bite. I *highly* recommend ordering this dish, and saving just a little bit of room for it. The service was decent, they didn't come by quite as often as I would like but they were polite and responsive when we did need things.One dish I was pleasantly surprised by was the wagyu beef maki. I've only had beef on a roll once and it tasted exactly like I thought it would. This dish, however, was different and incredible. I almost ordered it twice. I think the combination of a high quality meat, plus the other garnishes that they add in actually make it taste like more of a rice/meat dish than a sushi roll. I'd recommend coming here (and O-Ya of course) if you like sushi and are not on a budget.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Wow amazing. Worth visiting over and over again. The sushi is good, and the creativity is incredible. Had Omakasi 9 course which is the chef's selection. Wonderful experience with a mix of tastes.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"What a wonderful sushi bar experience thanks to Nancy, our top notched Server. Her welcoming spirit & knowledge of all the menus was an extra plus, in addition to her presence always on time.I kept my ordering pretty simple with the California/Vegetable Rolls & tasty order of SautÃ©ed Mushroom. My WomanBaby had the Teriyaki Chicken that was literally two marinated wings that was prepared braised style & stated they were a tad bit burnt. We also had the Vegetable Noodles that was plentiful for the both of us to enjoy. Good Japanese food that's a tad bit pricy yet worth it due to the ambience, artistic cuisine & very good service.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Mmmmm, Oishii is oishii. Good first impression, but Oishii really amazed me on my second visit.What makes Oishii stand out from all the other high-end sushi restaurants in Boston is the menu. Not only is it diverse, but you'll see exquisite plates here that you won't see anywhere else.For instance, the ***OCTOPUS CARPACCIO*** (citrus vinaigrette, jalapeÃ±o chips & granny smith apple).At first, you might think: octopus and apple, whaaatt? But this is a must-try! I was impressed by how well they go together. I appreciate the creativity and utter genius of each of the plates Oishii offers.My other recommendations:- TORO TARTARE: ossetra caviar, crispy shallots served in an ice block- WAGYU BEEF TATAKI: micro cilantro, crispy shallots & pickled red onion- LAMB CHOP: cut double thick, shiitake truffle sauce & crispy thymeOh, and any of the tuna toros are heavenly.Amazing food, very innovative. Great quality, excellent service. Nice ambience. Overall a delightful treat, and a five-star review from me. Will be back!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"I went here recently for an anniversary dinner and we arrived a bit earlier than expected. However, the staff was very kind and seated us early. I have to say customer service was great! We were unfamiliar with the menu because we've never been, so they were patient and explained to us what was on the menu. They were also very tentative in the sense that they always came over to check up on us to make sure everything was going well.We ordered more than what was pictured (the salmon on fire and something else). Everything tasted absolutely amazing, but the pork belly buns. I thought the meat was a bit dry and the sauce was too salty. But everything else was great! Would definitely recommend this place for any special occasion or even a normal date if you're feeling fancy.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Oishii has been one of my favorite Japanese (well, modern Japanese to be precise) restaurants in the Boston area for more than 5 years now. You can find both high quality ""traditional"" nigiri/sashimi and fancy makis as well as a variety of Asian-fusion appetizers/small plates - there's something for everyone! My absolute favorite dish at Oishii is the O-toro truffle risotto. For some reason, the dish is no longer listed on the official menu. However, when I asked for it during my most recent visit, the waitress gladly checked with the kitchen and was able to have it made for us! We had to order 2 orders of it - it's that good (although pricey at $35 per dish). It comes with 3 thick slices of fatty tuna (just melts in your mouth) topped with a generous amount of truffle and gold flakes, served with mushroom risotto on the side. The mixture of texture and flavor was so heavenly (even just to think about it!!).I would also recommend the Lobster dumplings (they are fried dumplings filled with chunks of lobsters and cream cheese, served with a plum/soy dipping sauce), as well as the Uni pasta topped with a poached duck egg (the texture of the pasta is very unique). Oh, and don't forget to get the Green Tea Layer Cake for dessert (it's like Lady M crepe cakes, but I personally think it's better)!!I always prefer to sit at the sushi counter as I'm so fascinated and amazed at how the chefs turn simple ingredients into delicious dishes that are also beautifully presented! Reservation recommended but they can often accommodate walk ins.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"I loveeee this place! Food, service, and quality is amazing! For appetizers, I've tried the following:-Broiled Truffle edamame: After trying the truffle edamame I don't think I will ever look at edamame the same way. Literally the best! -Salmon on fire: This was fantastic, definitely one of my favorite dishes here. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now.-Sakura Smoked Hamachi: This was good but not as memorable as the 2 dishes above. -Wagyu Beef Ishiyaki: you cook this on a hot stone which was cool. Wagyu is always good so no complaints here. For entrees: -Squid Ink Noodles: I didn't know what to expect but it was really good.

OMG it was so good, I especially loved the raisins that go with it! Would get this again.-Coconut Sphere with Coffee Mousse and Yuzu Sherbet: The presentation was on point and it was fun to break. I loved the coffee mousse inside but the sherbet was a little to tart for my liking but overall I would get it again.-Lychee & Green Tea mochi: I really enjoyed this, it was very soft.For Drinks:-Lychee Martini: This was good, they did make it very strong though but I'm not complaining :) -Hot sake: Drank this on a cold winter day, it was good Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here. It is pricey here so prepare to ball out.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"2,I had one uni sashimi but it wasn't that good. The uni felt granny. The uni spaghetti was good. The wagyubeef on hotstone was disastrous. It was not chewable and not like wagyu beef at all and it had the price of 60 dollars. However what was good is that we told the waiter and he took it off our bill. Conclusion: over priced food is not even that good,Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"2,"Don't sit in the basement! I went with a friend and we both had omakase. The atmosphere was really lacking and we were treated like second class citizens although our dinner was well over $200. The fish was good but nothing spectacular. I wish I was able to sit in the main room....I am subtracting a star based on the conversation I heard at the table next to us. A group of young people ordered a bottle of sake, it was brought to their table, opened, poured... but before anyone had any, they realized the server brought the wrong bottle... not what they had ordered. The group politely asked for the bottle they initially wanted but after a few trips back and forth, the server told them that because the restaurant already opened it, they would have to pay for it and drink it. The folks at the table were about 22 and Asian. I would have not accepted those terms... it seems ridiculous, but that's the way the restaurant handled it. The patrons were basically coaxed into ""dealing with it"", while dropping at least three Benjamins on their meal. That's literally bullshit customer service.Verdict: Skip it. Go to a regular sushi place and don't pay so much for a good high end atmosphere. That doesn't exist at this place. Yes, I like omakase and exotic fish but I would rather get a ticket to California and savor the badass sushi in the Bay over trying to find it in Boston.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Items ordered: Smoked Tuna Tataki, Pork belly buns appetizer, White tiger roll, Toro Truffle roll, Lobster lettuce rollPros:- Unique items on the menu that I've never seen at other sushi restaurants. The Smoked tuna appetizer came in a bell jar filled with cedar smoke that gave the tuna a taste reminiscent of smores. The white tiger roll was wrapped in white seaweed with black stripes. - I've been to several sushi restaurants in Vancouver and they don't compare with the artistry and flavour of the food here. - Modern decor with low noise levels, I saw many people here on dates or business dinner. - I don't recommend using soy sauce at all as the rolls comes with their own taste and sauces. Cons: - I would not recommend the Lobster lettuce roll, it was good but compared to the others, it was underwhelming for the price ($17). It was also harder to eat given its diameter and the lobster flavour was masked by all the lettuce and cucumber.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Oishii is probably one of my friend's and my favorite Japanese restaurants in Boston. We pretty much ordered more than half of their menu already. Great reviews on most, however, there's a few DON'T EVER ORDER:5 stars Â  Â  Â - most sushis and makis: Just almost impossible to go wrong. The combination of makis is awesome, and bana uni is a must every time- A5 steak: slightly pricey but definitely something worth trying at least once- uni pasta: if you love uni and truffle then don't ever miss it4 stars Â  Â - most hot appetizers: we tried wagyu beef, salmon, etc. they never disappoint and very instagram worthy. But some seem slightly overpriced with the portion size - teriyaki ribeye: on the less pricey end on their menu, but def still awesome- chef's choice sashimi platter: just because I'm not a fan of half of the type of fishes they served - Ting's companion cocktail: very light and refreshing- desserts: red bean creme brÃ»lÃ©e, iced melon, molten chocolate cake3 stars- desserts : Mochi ice cream. Good but not a must1 star- green salad $10: meh lol. Don't ask us why we ordered salad here but now I can tell you - Get the salad somewhere else; not worth the price... well, unless you REALLY love gingerZERO STAR - OMG DO NOT EVER FKING ORDER - seafood udon: from a restaurant like this, I never expected the full bowl to be fish cakes and fish cakes AND FISH CAKES... oh and some tiny ass shrimps and vegetables. I was very offended by the quality of this dish.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"If you're looking to indulge in sushi, definitely treat yourself out and go to Oishii! This upscale restaurant is super sleek and all of the dishes are jaw-droppingly gorgeous but equally delicious. It's the perfect place to take a date or to grab a group of friends together. You'll certainly impress or even if it's super awkward, the presentation will give you something to talk about.I originally was planning to order the Toro Truffle Maki but was drawn away by the variety of their lunch menu sets and opted for the Kaiseki 3 which seemed to be a really popular shareable amongst the other couples also having lunch. The way to go here is to do everything family style it seems.The Kaiseki 3 with its 9 small plates was more than enough for just me! I left feeling stuffed but I want to highlight my favorites from the set:- seared wild king salmon with ikura (ikura wasn't too salty and the salmon had a great nibble)- grilled miso black cod (super tender and sweet)- sake and rocky sushi (salmon was buttery and the eel paired well with the avocado)- spicy tuna salad cucumber handroll (refreshing and cucumber held everything together well)Can't wait to come back!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Two weeks ago, I went here for dinner with my friend. We ordered:* Scallops Crispy Shiso w/crispy taro* Grilled Black Cod w/miso sauce* Â Sudachi Seared Hamachi roll* Japanese A5 steakWe also ordered a bottle of Hakkaisan sake from Niigata. Everything was delicious. They also gave us a complimentary appetizer of edamame mousse which was also good.For dessert, I got the read bean crÃ¨me brulee which is also very tasty.It was busy even on a Sunday night.. A lot of other parties also order the Salmon on Fire which looked pretty good. Hope to try that next time!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Been wanting to try this place for awhile, and we finally made it for lunch. Very nice ambiance with dim lighting and modern Japanese design. We ordered the Salmon on Fire as an appetizer. It's four strips of raw salmon over a wooden stand and comes to your table with a flame underneath it which you blow out after 10 seconds. Presentation is excellent, and the salmon itself was fresh and perfectly marinaded. For rolls, we ordered the Toro Truffle, Oishii Sashimi, and White Tiger. The Oishii Sashimi was my favorite- it's wrapped in cucumber instead of seaweed and was very refreshing. The Toro Truffle roll, however, was way too salty for my taste. This place is definitely on the pricier end, but with the excellent and attentive customer service, quality of the food, and the effort put into presentation, it's well worth the price.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"3,"More of a 3.5 stars: We were here for lunch and we ordered the chicken teriyaki, spicy seafood udon, chicken fried rice, oishii sashimi maki, and red bean creme brÃ»lÃ©e. We use to come here a lot around 1-2 years ago but came less because we felt the quality was starting to decline. Coming back today, we noticed that the menu has changed from the past and it appears that some dishes we use to have are no longer on the list. The Maki's are still good, we still like them very much but the entrees use to be better, especially for its price. The chicken teriyaki was very dry and rubbery, definitely not pleasant to eat. The teriyaki sauce seemed pretty generic as well, something we might be able to buy at a grocery store. The seafood noodles had some seafood but much more fish cakes and those frozen seafood type things (not sure what they're called). The fried rice was nice and tasty, but it was the size of one regular rice bowl. For $18 I believe, they definitely could've used more carefully selected ingredients or at least given more. The freshness and taste of the fish used in sashimi/nigiri is good but I don't believe it was aged/seasoned like other higher end sushi restaurants. If you're going to just get sashimi or nigiri, you are probably better off going to a fish market and getting sashimi grade fish there yourself. Overall, presentation of the food was good and creative, and the Maki's are worth getting at the very least. On the other hand the quality and value for the entrees seem to be lacking. Lunch specials on the weekdays are still of good value so that's definitely worth trying!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Oishii means delicious in Japanese. The food was very much ""oishii"" here. The ambience is beautiful too- there is a small pond in the middle of the room.We started off with some sake. We also ordered salmon that was hanging off a small rack- they lit it on fire. You must order this! It cooks your salmon slightly, and is covered in delicious sauce. We also had the beef tartarte, which came with a shell like thing on top, and a raw egg. It looked like a work of art. I didn't want to destroy it but since I paid for it, I devoured it.We also ordered a few sushi rolls and the seafood risotto. The risotto came in a hot pot, it was ok... it was a bit more like claypot rice to me. We wanted to order toro but I think they were out, so we ordered scallops instead. Our waiter was excellent, he made very good recommendations.This place is great, you should come here to celebrate a special occasion or to simply indulge in Japanese food.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"4,"Came here on a Saturday night and Oishii managed to fill me in a last minute reservation. Sashimi/sushi was super fresh and easy to understand. You can either get chef's choice or they'll give you a pen where you mark whichever you want. Their squid ink was exceptional. Golden flakes decorated on the top with super tender calamaris. Ugh, I could just have a dream about it tonight. Also had the seafood risotto and to be honest, I could skip that but the scallops were cooked to perfection. Downfall-- they give you an appetizer as soon as you sit down and it was edamame purÃ©e but no one seemed to explain to me what it was (could've died if I were actually allergic to it, but thank goodness I wasn't.) Gorgeous place/ delicious food but if you're not from town, please don't drive because you will not find parking and will end up paying $20 for valet.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"5,"Best pint in the city, and has been for years.

I dined at lunch, right at opening. It was seat yourself and I was able to pick a booth near an open window. The service was quick and very considerate. The clam chowder was very good. It was nice and creamy. I also had the chicken tenders which were properly crispy. They would be a great choice for picky, younger kids. The onion rings were excellent! Probably my favorite thing I ate today and the best onion rings I've had in a very long time!! Usually the onions inside are a weird texture or completely pulled out when you eat them but I totally did NOT experience that with these! The combo platter was tasty as well.

Very very noisy when we stepped in and gradually the noise died down. Ordered the Fish Sandwich, and the Ted Kennedy burger. They both were just about average. We also ordered Clam Chowder. It was the best Chowder we had tasted. Lots of clam bits, and you could smell the ocean in it. We later had Clam Chowder at many places during our trip including the Cape and Mr Dooley's had the best.",Mr. Dooley's,"77 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"3,"Did you know that a quality pint of Guinness depends on how it's stored? Apparently, Dooley's has one of the best pints in the city.

Menu is helpful to people who are not familiar with Japanese tapas. They provide pictures of most food on the menu. They also give a lot of food options, way more comparing to an average Japanese restaurant. Food quality? It is good enough that you want to compare it with a izakaya in Japan. It is authentic. Some food options are better than others, but considering the wide varieties they provide, you can't complain when they overlook the egg or add too much soy sauce in the noodle. I mean, when you are considering food options in the States, you would go for a restaurant for its steak, go for another one for its seafood. Same in other countries. Back in Japan, I will go to one place for Hakata Ramen, go for another place for Sapporo Ramen, another place for sushi... This place is like Applebee's, offering you a bunch of options, but you can always find something better.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"4,A fan of their whole eel dish as it costs the similar to other restaurants (other restaurants will have smaller piece of eel and add rice). Â Mentaiko was good but expensive. Â Okonomiyaki was alright but still trying to find a legit Hiroshima style version where they layer the ingredients. I wish they opened for lunch!!!,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"3,"Very authentic Japanese food! Keep in mind that the place is more tapas style so best to order a few things to satisfy your hunger. When my friends and I came here, we got the following: -Okonomiyaka: okay, but too salty for my liking -Chefs combo: the meats we got were chicken, beef and pork belly. Thought the chicken was the best, while the beef was wayyy too hard. -Mentaiko pasta special (cod fish roe pasta): one of their most popular dishes. Really good!! -Tokoyaki: yum, super flavorful. Fav of the night~-Quail eggs wrapped in bacon: good! Overall, it was a good time. There were some very minor flaws with some of the dishes, but the food that we did like were really good. Would come back to try out the other dishes!! Their menu is very extensive so you're sure to find something you like. And the best part is everything is very affordable. Definitely a place worth checking out!!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,"This restaurant is hands down my go-to when I am craving for Japanese food but not your typical sushi/tempura food. My favorite items on their menu is their cod roe fish pasta, omusoba, and steak don! There are so many items that I have enjoyed and still a lot that I have not yet tried.Sashimi - Tastes really fresh and I love that they offer a lot of different combinations and styles of preparing itAburi Salmon No Oshizushi - Wow this roll itself does not even need soy sauce because it is already seasoned; the proportions of the rice and fish is surprisingly really goodAssorted kushiyaki - I would say that these are my least favorite because when I had it, it was really really dry and super hard to get it off the sticksOmusoba - The egg is super soft with the perfect amount of seasoning on top which wraps some flavorful noodles underneath. This is honestly one of the best combinations ever and crave for this all the time!Steak Don - Perfect amount of steak that is cooked perfectly and seasoned well over a bed of rice. Love how no other restaurants offer this. Honestly this reminds me of a dish that my mom always makes so this hits the spot for me Katsu Don - Pork was cooked really well and the egg was super soft; this is quite a usual dish I find at every restaurant so I would choose more unique dishes if you want to try something new; still worth it to order though!Beef Sushi - This was something different that I've never tried before so this was a pleasure to eat - the meat was cooked medium/medium rare and it just melted in my mouth along with the riceBeef Tongue w/ scallions - Highly recommend ordering this; it was so addicting to eat because I love how they seasoned it and they give you a lot of scallions which pairs very well with it! Not a fan of eating a lot of scallion at once, but I wrapped the beef around it and it was REALLY goodTakoyaki - One of the better takoyaki in Boston; perfectly crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the in side. Love how big they are too!Waffles a la Mode - The flan was the best part because the waffle was too dense and not the texture you find in a typical Belgium waffle; this comes with ice cream as well with your choice of vanilla, red bean, or green teaSesame Pudding - I am in love with anything sesame; at first I thought it was pretty bland with some mild sesame flavor, but I later discovered that you get more flavor when you scrape the sides :D love this dessert now hahaOn top of the great food and service, they have valet parking too! This is perfect because I am terrible at parallel parking....let alone finding parking in Boston!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"4,"Came here on a Saturday evening and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the restaurant considering how many reviews I've read referring to this place as a ""hole-in-the-wall"", ""crowded"", and ""busy"". Luckily my friend and I were eating dinner around 5:30pm so it was not too crowded and we got seated immediately.I split an Omusoba with my friend (we got it because it seems to be a popular item to order) and I got a spicy miso ramen as well. The omusoba was well presented and fairly delicious with its balance of saltiness from the Yakisoba sauce and creaminess from the mayo and egg. It definitely reminds me of the okonomiyaki I had in Osaka though it was probably a bit on the lighter side with the Yakisoba and mayo sauces (not necessarily a bad thing since I find that those sauces sometimes make the dish heavier than I would like). The spicy miso ramen had a nice flavorful broth (menu says it's a chicken-tonkotsu base). One quip that I sometimes have with ramen is that the broth is room-temperature or just not warm enough, and this ramen definitely did not suffer from this problem. I definitely enjoyed drinking the broth. The one other notable thing about this ramen was that for meat they used pork innards instead of chashu. The texture and flavor of the innards was interesting at first, but I probably would have just preferred chashu. Besides the meat, there were some peppers, bean sprouts, and of course ramen noodles (RIP no soft boiled egg =/).All in all, the meal was solid and the service was good. I don't know if I would order the same dishes again, but I am definitely looking forward to coming back to Ittoku to try out their yakitori and other small dishes.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"4,They should turn on the AC during the summer time. Their food is good but the place is too hot and humid to truly enjoy everything.,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"4,"Great customer service, great quality food, somewhat pricey ($86 pretax for a *light*meal for 4).

Absolutely love trying new dishes as well as returning to my favorites! Mentaiko pasta is mouthwatrring good! Not super fishy tasting and well balanced between the cheese and salmon. So good! The one downfall of ittoku is the wait times! They do not they reservations on fridays and Saturdays so beating the crowd is always hard to do. If you linger by the bar you can catch a shorter wait time.,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,"Keep it simple!$4 beer +5pcs of yakitori (chef's choice) = decent after work meal under $10... well, yeah maybe tack on $2 for tip if you feel like it.Like I said, ""keep it simple!"" just sayin'",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"4,"I've been here a few times. The first couple times, I was not too impressed but it wasn't terrible. I just felt like I wasn't ordering the right things. I remember going for different rolls/sushi and yakitori. They put a lot of rice on their rolls, which I'm not a big fan of. The yakitori selection is very good, but I think some of them could be too salty so beware. By my 3rd time, I went with a couple friends who had traveled to Japan pretty frequently so I trusted them a bit more on what to order. We ordered quite a few things to share but the items that really stood out was Ika Yaki (broiled squid), Omusoba (yakisoba noodles in an egg omlette), and for dessert, the Belgian waffle with flan and ice cream. The squid was chewy and perfectly seasoned - I LOVED IT. The Omusoba was full of so much flavor. I wished it was a bigger size to be honest! As for the Belgian waffle with flan and ice cream, it was such a nice balance to the rest of the meal. The waffle was warm and slightly chewy. The flan was the right amount of sweet. We opted for green tea ice cream, which complemented the whole thing. The only thing that I don't like is that there is usually a wait whenever I have gone. Granted, that must mean they are doing something right! Harry's is just down the street so I suggest waiting and getting a drink there if you're with your friends. Overall, this is one of my favorite places in Allston. Highly recommend for adventurous eaters!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"4,Cheap and casual style Japanese restaurant. Highly recommended to people who would like know Japanese casual dining.,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,"Incredibly delicious meal at a very affordable price! We came here for dinner and drinks and spent wya less than anticipated. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, of which my favorite were the carpaccio, 5 kinds sashimi, tuna tartare, and beef tongue. All of the fish was super fresh and delicious! Also, the house warm sake was really tasty and smooth; much better than expected. I will definitely be back!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,"My FAVORITE Japanese place in Boston. This place is so good and pretty close to authentic. The food is so flavorful and delicious! The service is good with nice servers and hot food even when it's busy. I HIGHLY recommend eating here, but make a reservation (esp. on the weekends!). It's street parking, which makes it hard to find a spot, but it's absolutely worth it!!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,"This is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Boston. Near impossible to find parking so their valet park for $5.00 may be the way to go if you don't want to take public transportation. It has the best Yakitori in Boston. Beer and Yakitori and their other small plates is the way to go. Sushi is good also. This is a great place to meet up friends. It has Â great food, great atmosphere, and great service. I have been here multiple times and always had great service. Always. The great thing about this restaurant is the picture menu. You know exactly what you're ordering. Our favorite is the chicken skin, chicken meatball, the chicken thigh, chicken gizzards, chicken heart, basically almost everything on the menu. The beef ones are also very good. Even the grilled rice is good. You really have to try everything. If you're adventurous, try the fatty beef tongue as it is one of my husband's favorite. If you're thinking you'd be French kissing a cow, I would steer clear. Also the cuts of bacon and sausages goes well with a cold beer. Items to share would be the okonomiyaki. Basically a crispy pancake. I would share the creamy pasta since it's only good in small portion. It gets heavy after the first few bites. Very standard but also good hamachi kama, broiled yellowtail collar. The adashi tofu is good also. The sushi selection is pretty good for the price. I recommend ordering the carpaccio. You get thinly sliced sashimi over a bed of greens. It has a light vinaigrette dressing. I also recommend the sashimi. The cuts are thick. We have tried the salmon, yellowtail, and tuna. All are very good quality. The mackerel sashimi is also very good but has a stronger fish taste. The botan ebi is very fresh. The sea conch sushi has a a crunchy texture but is very fresh. A good maki to try is the fatty tuna maki with scallion. The takowasa or wasabi and fresh chopped octopus is very good. It is slimy because of the fresh octopus so this is not a dish for everyone. I do not recommend the takoyaki. It is very dry. The steamed monkfish liver sushi was only okay. I have had better at other sushi restaurants. It's not creamy here but rather grainy. See my pictures.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,"Holy shit this place was so good, and I feel like everything I have to say is just reiterating what everybody else is saying. I went with a group of 7 at around 8 on a Saturday night and it took us about 50 minutes to be seated. They don't take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays, so it's kind of expected that it'll take long. Luckily it took most of those 50 minutes for all 7 of us to get there so it didn't end up feeling like much of wait. The staff was all extremely friendly and very helpful. Most of food was all amazing and at its worst couple of things were decent. Â Toro Toro Gyutan (meltingly delicious beef tongue)- the menu description is on point. It was ridiculously tender and juicy, probably the best beef tongue I've ever had in my life. Next time I go, I just want to order 3 plates of this. Â Chewy Fresh Cod Roe Pasta - Sooo good. The noodles were chewy and the sauce was thick and satisfying. The cod roe just adds a little saltiness and umami to what would've already been a delicious pasta dish. It actually made me sad how Japanese culture took a Western dish and did their best to improve it by adding their influence, meanwhile in America we're like hey let's take this sushi....and put it in a burrito. Omusoba - So satisfying to cut into. The egg is a little thinner than I would expect but the eggs and the sauces mix together with the yakisoba to create a hearty and satisfying dish. Tori Karage - It was good, the chicken wasn't dry but I thought the outside could've been a little crispier. I'm curious how it compares to the other fried chicken dishes but all in all, it was still pretty good. It comes with some mayo, some kind of sauce that seemed in between a ketchup and hot sauce, and some cumin. We also got the 10 piece yakitori combo. I thought it would be a good idea to get a bunch since there were so many of us and we could save a little money. It was all good but we got more gizzard and some other kind of intestine (liver?) than I'd like. I really wanted to try the thigh and short-rib and it didn't end up coming with the combo. I think you'd be better off just individually ordering the things you want. This + a few other dishes I didn't get a chance to try + a couple pitchers of Sapporo = one of the best dining experiences I had in a long time.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"3,"This is probably one of the more local, affordable izakaya places in boston.

When this place first opened, I was excited to finally visit and try some Japanese foods I can hardly find in Boston. I was amazed with the menu. There is a diverse selection of foods from your traditional izakaya eats like yakitori, to sushi, and hotter meals like ramen and rice bowls. On top of that there is a large selection of sake. I prefer my sake dry and full bodied :) Kudos to the taste profile chart. It makes ordering sake easier. If you're unsure, ask for a sample. Overall, this place is pretty good and a solid choice if you're craving for some hard to find Japanese dishes.

I have tons of reviews like this.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,"With a mix of amazing Japanese food and beers you can't go wrong here. Like a traditional Izukaya they offer lots of grilled yakitori which is delicious. They also offer some ramen, sushi and fun drinks as well besides just beer. Highly suggest this restaurant with a group of people so you can order and share lots of different things! Only downside is that it is always busy and as such very loud sometimes too",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,My favorite Japanese restaurant in Boston! Ittoku is almost always packed! I've came a couple of times and had to wait more than an hour. I recommend coming early at 5pm when it opens or later at night after 8:30pm.I love that they put pictures of most of the menu items so you know what you're getting. I always get the skewers and I'm never disappointed. I also love ordering their sushi because they don't skimp out on fish and the fish they use is fresh! Cod roe pasta was light and chewy. I definitely recommend getting this! The omusoba was a bit too oily for me and could have been skipped! The okonomiyaki was flavorful and was packed with meat and a lot of cabbage.I've ordered the Aburi Salmon Oshizushi a couple of times and it was great! I didn't expect it to be spicy.Parking is hard around the area but they do offer $5 valet parking.,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"5,"On our quick trip to Boston we found this via Yelp. I've rated other things five stars but this place needs 11 stars!!!! Culinary delight doesn't even cut it!!!The place is small- we had a hard time finding seating because it was so popular, and we sat at a long table. Some people sat next to us and a woman right next to us at our table kept looking at us hard every time we talked, so you may not get your own table if you care about that. I will say that the food is a must try! I had a grains and greens bowl. It wasn't as good as Cava but it was good. The rest of our order was AMAZING, however.My son got a lamb sandwich, other son got a grilled cheese panini style sandwich, we got a raspberry muffin which is to die for!

Plus the staff was so sweet and helpful.",Flour Bakery + Café,"12 Farnsworth St Boston, MA 02210"4,"Flour CafÃ© has expanded to many corners of Boston, but this is the location I've visited most.Despite the ever creeping expansion of the brand, Flour has retained its quality overall. On my most recent visit I got some of my favorites for an in-depth review. Here are my thoughts.Oreo cookie-sweet and creamy inside. Cookie is soft, cocoa flavor. Not crispy. Fresh made buttercream filling is much superior to that of a store-bought Oreo. Soft, creamy, and very sweet. I also appreciate that the filling doesn't stiff up like concrete to the cookie, but rather has a buttery consistency. The cookie itself is on the softer side, which would be my only complaint as I would like a little more crunch when I bite into the cookie. But it's perfect for those who prefer a softer style cookie. Banana bread has a soft and spongey texture. I think the bread used to be denser and heavier. Otherwise it is moist, sweet and has a ripe banana flavor. Walnuts are nice. Crust has a deeper molasses complexity. Carrot cake has a cream cheese frosting reminiscent of NYC style cheesecake, with a sour cream tang. Raisins, a hint of coconut and shredded carrots in tandem with cinnamon and nutmeg create a satisfying depth of flavor. The Boston cream cake is a layered version of the dessert. Several layers of whipped cream and cake. The whipped cream filling is a different experience than a traditional custard filling. Very creamy, but not as heavy. The whipped cream also delivers a little more flavor than a custard filling. Also seemed like the cake has been soaked in a coffee liqueur/syrup. Not a perfect Boston cream, but it is an interesting take on the dessert. Flour remains a solid recommendation.",Flour Bakery + Café,"12 Farnsworth St Boston, MA 02210"4,"Stopped here while traveling before heading to the airport. Loved the atmosphere and paper marbling art on the walls. A colorful cafe with a fun personality! I got the breakfast egg and ham sandwich on gluten free bread. Normally I expect a smaller sandwich, but their gluten free bread is huge! It was very filling and the sauce on it (some kind of dijon) was really tasty. I ordered a green tea with it and noticed they make their own loose leaf bags. Very cool. Also took an iced almond milk chai and gf/vegan almond macaron to go. Yum! The girl on POS remembered my name when I walked up to place my to-go order. Love that! Would have given five stars but my green tea was only poured like 3/4 full. Understandable at an establishment that gets so busy, but still not ideal. Definitely plan to get something sweet if you come here. All of their desserts looks delicious!",Flour Bakery + Café,"12 Farnsworth St Boston, MA 02210"4,"I was in Boston for a business meeting, I was saving my lunch for one of the famous sticky buns I've been reading about and seeing on social media.I'm from New York. We have a few rings from our baseball team. We also have crowd control when it comes to in demand items like Cronuts. (I've waited multiple times on line at Dominique Ansel Bakery, the Cronut is king) Walking into Flour Bakery + CafÃ©, its total madness. There are people everywhere, there are no lines, no signs and more importantly, no Sticky Buns. It's noon and I ask the counter person, I don't see any Sticky Buns, do you have any in the back? Nope, we ran out earlier today. What??? The counter person noticed I was bummed so he directed me to the bread pudding with the sticky bun topping. Alright..

I stopped at night and it wasnt busy at the time so I was able to look around and see what they had to offer. I got the sticky bun everyone raved about and a raspberry bar. The raspberry bar was fresh and I couldnt resist myself from eating it by the time I left out the door. It was still warm and delicious it made my night to have this treat. The next morning I warmed up my sticky bun and was the perfect way to start my day. The bun soaked all the flavors in and was not overly sweet but just right.

It is specifically known for its sticky buns. The pecans and sauce on top of the bun were incredible and gave the ""Wow"" factor. The brioche bun was also delicious. They were like donuts. I was also at the bakery near the end of the day when they only had a sticky bun bread pudding. The pudding was good but it is not for everyone. Since it is pudding, it can get a little soggy at the end of the day. As such, it is why the regular sticky bun, with the brioche bread, is the top seller. Nevertheless, the bread pudding version still has the caramelized pecans on top, which is the best part of the sticky buns.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

Service was excellent, though I felt a tad rushed at times.",Nico Ristorante,"417 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"The only reason I'm deducting a star is because of service/bread/AC.Starting with the major positives, THE FOOD. I got the mushroom ravioli and it was insanely delicious. I looked behind me and there was a table of 6 and 5/6 of the guests at the table had ordered the mushroom ravioli as well - they basically licked their plates clean. The ravioli is light and the sauce is heavenly. My boyfriend got the chicken parm and was extremely satisfied as well.The restaurant is fairly cozy, like most restaurants in the North End. We sat at the bar and the bar service wasn't super speedy; however, the food came out decently quick. They don't have the best bread, but leaves more room for the food. The AC was blowing pretty cold at the bar, but I guess better than the days prior when it was broken! All in all, I highly recommend it.

A strip of fresh mozzarella cheese wrapped in prosciutto and then grilled. Melty, cheesy, smoked goodness. Insane.Main course, I chose the veal marsala and it was the best I've had. Thin cut veal in a rich mushroom and marsala sauce. Easy to cut with just the side of a knife, Yum. On the side, a fresh store-made fusilli pasta. I managed to clear the plate, it was that good.Service was awesome. Price was quite good. Five people with at least four glasses of wine, two starters and five mains, still under $300.

Excellent service.",Nico Ristorante,"417 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Wow-wow-wow-woweeee! My friends always recommended Nico and it took The Boy and I entirely too long to finally make it happen. To start, we ordered the Polpetta di Mamma Rosetta (veal + beef meatball) and a Caprese salad. The meatball is a MUST-HAVE. First of all it's a hefty ball - we split it between a party of 4 and there's plenty to go around, but it's so tasty I'll say you'll want to only split it between 2.For my entree, I ordered one of the special's of the night: The Cioppino and if you ever get the chance, don't pass on this dish! It was served in a large metal bowl and filled to the brim with an assortment of seafood (peep that photo). So full of seafood in fact, I barely made a dent in it to reach the pasta at the bottom. To get an idea of how good this dish was, people walking in and waiting for their table continued to peek at our table and you could hear them asking 'What did she get? That looks good' and good it was.The Boy got the Rigatoni con Carciofi e Salsiccia. I was so overwhelmed and enthralled with my own dish, I didn't try a bite of his as I usually do. However, I have no doubt it was equally as amazing. The homemade rigatoni looked divine and lets just put it at The Boy didn't take home any leftovers.I highly recommend making a reservation by the way.

I found out about Nico by doing a Yelp search on restaurants in the Italian district in Downtown Boston and then reading reviews and looking at photos. Â I checked out the menu on Yelp and found mushroom ravioli and was totally sold! Â Took a 20-min cab drive to get here but it was sooooo worth it. Â This is a very small cozy restaurant (but I think a lot of the restaurants in Boston are small) but I went to eat rather early and although the restaurant was almost at capacity, I was able to get a seat at the bar, *lucky me*. Â I highly recommend getting a reservation, as I totally lucked out, but that may not always be the case and I guarantee you will be disappointed if you come here and then can't get in or have to wait over an hour.First they bring you some bread to dip in a heavenly oil & olives. Â I don't eat olives, but I thought of my best friend who does and know she would have loved it. Â It was so good, I was worried I might fill up on this before my dinner even arrived. For my drink I ordered the raspberry chocolate martini but asked if they could do it without the coffee liquor as I dislike the taste of coffee and can't handle caffeine. Â No problem! The bartender was excellent and whipped up a great ""custom made"" drink for me. Â For my entree, I got the Ravioli al Funghi Porcini (delish!).

Veal is on its way and they are gonna need a cart to get me out of here!!!,Nico Ristorante,"417 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"What a cool concept for a bar/restaurant. We loved the speakeasy feel of the place, and the rotating chefs creating menus from all of over the world makes this a unique place to visit that can't ever become boring. What I think is so special about this South End Speakeasy is that they showcase up-and-coming chefs, giving them a place to be creative.Our menu was created by Humaari which had a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern vibe. We originally had a reservation for 6, in which case, for a set price, the chef will prepare dishes to share specially for your group. Sadly, 4 our crew's flights were cancelled, so it was just my husband and me. Our server recommended ordering several to share plates, so we started with the Grilled Black Mission Figs. A perfect size for sharing, this delicious dish was definitely our favorite. We also shared the Marinated Summer Vegetables hummus- I HIGHLY recommend this. It was so fresh, we were licking the plate clean. They will replace your pita, too, if you run out. The Chickpea Crepes were next. The dish, served with baba ganoush, red onion, ramp pesto and maras, was tasty, extremely savory. I thought this would be my favorite, but it probably ranked number four for me. This might be because it got forgotten and we didn't get it until we were tired, full, and ready to leave. There were other options that included meats, but we find we love to eat vegetarian when it comes to Mediterranean meals. My husband had the Ghost Hunter cocktail which he loved. I started with the Persian Summer, which reads like a dark and stormy, but is extremely sweet. I followed it with the Into the Wild, which was polar opposite: earthy and savory. I preferred the latter with our meal.Our service was extremely slow. The tables to our left and right turned over twice before we were able to leave, and we were not eating slowly or trying to stay up all night. Be prepared to be patient.

Came here for my friend's birthday and I have been hooked ever since! Honestly, I'm probably going to go back every two weeks or so. Chef Louis DiBiccari, you are a genius when it comes to hummus. I loved all the different flavors and how they melded together to create the PERFECT (yes, PERFECT) bowl of hummus. I could eat it on its own without the pita bread. I got to try the duck hummus and it was so amazing. I went back again and the duck hummus was not on the menu anymore, but I tried the sautÃ©ed beef hummus and it was just as good. You really can't go wrong here. The steak was tasty! I also got to try the lamb at one point and it was SO DELICIOUS. I am salivating at the thought of it. I think this may be my new favorite place... I'll be back in a few :)",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Would go back again. Stopped in to have a few drinks before a theater performance. We were seated right away in a lounge area with leather chairs and a small table which was perfect for the 2 of us. One negative thing that stood out to me was how easily sound traveled. Â We did not have many people close to us and the place was not packed but it was hard to hear my boyfriend at times with all the chatter. Otherwise I liked the decor and seating options. Big downside was the slow service. We arrived with about 45 minutes. Our first drink came relatively fast, but once we finished them we sat hoping to order another. About 20 minutes went by and when we finally saw our server again we needed the check so we could leave. Otherwise, our server was very nice and had great suggestions, just wish we had had the opportunity to order more.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Always love the food here. A staple in south end that you need to try out. This was probably our favorite time visiting as they had middle eastern style food - lots of hummus! The drinks came out on time and the food was a little bit faster. Highly recommend making a reservation here. If you try to walk in, you will end up waiting hours. Definitely a great place for date nights, girls night out, etc. great vibes!",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Wink and Nod is a really cool cocktail bar in the south end. The bar has a prohibition era style and it's a hit amongst locals and visitors alike. Came over for a nightcap and ended up having two. ""The Mission"" is a very tasty take on an old fashioned. Rye, Mission Fig, Walnut Bitters, Orange, and Lemon Oil. Boy was this cocktail awesome. Im droolin just thinking about it!Grab a seat by a booth and enjoy the visit. This place is awesome for a boys night out or a date/night out in town.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Wink & Nod operates a rotating kitchen every 6 months. This month, they were serving Spanish food. I love Spanish food so I decided to come.*Finding the restaurant*Finding the restaurant can be a little challenging. When it gets later at night, there is a bouncer outside. If you are just going for drinks late at night, look for the bouncer.*Seating tips*There are 2 different sections for seats. One is downstairs right next to the bar. That is where we sat, and it got pretty loud. There were groups of people standing around the bar, and some were really near the tables, so it will be loud. There is also another seating area in what looked like the mezzanine area, away from the bar. I would recommend sitting there if you don't want to have to shout.*The drinks*The cocktail menu is excellent here. They even had a winter special which was a egg nog with a layer of Bacardi 151 on top. They would set the 151 on fire in front of you, which was cool.*The food*-Spanish cheeses: these came with grilled bread which was excellent. I thought that it was a little weird that nobody explained what kind of cheese we were being served. The menu simply said assorted cheeses, and the person who served us the cheese dropped it off and walked away. Luckily the cheese was delicious.-Fried calamari: this was the bomb. The calamari pieces were lightly fried, with delicious sauce.-Paella: this was a disappointment. It was more like claypot rice with seafood on top. IT wasn't even served in a paella pan, it seemed to have been cooked in a claypot and even had the burnt edges of claypot rice. Maybe it was more ""creative""? But that was not paella to me.-Emapnadas: These came with some sort of jelly, which I did not really like. I just ate the empanadas. They were good but small. I've had better empanadas, sorry.Overall, this is a cool restaurant to visit. Make sure to check out the rotating chefs to know what kind of cuisine is cooking in the kitchen.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"5,"My fiancÃ© and I are sitting here at the bar at Wink & Nod just reveling in a singular experience. We walked in at 10pm on a Monday night and the place was pretty dead. Not surprising. We asked if they were still serving food and they said that they had just shut down their grill and oven, so no luck. Again, understandable and unsurprising. But this is where things went off the rails in an amazing way. Julian, our bartender, and Louie (who we would later learn is their head chef) started going through options of places in the area that would be still serving food and giving their favorites dishes at each. Then, after I mentioned that my fiancÃ© was really looking for vegetables, Louie pulled out their menu and started trying to figure out what he could do for us. They settled on a vegetable hummus plate and Louie set of to make it just for us. In the meantime, Julian proceeded to make me a special smoked Old Fashioned (by Laura's request). When the hummus plate arrived, it was delectable, as were our drinks. What a treat! These guys could have simply turned us away. It would have been perfectly acceptable. Instead, they went out of there way to try to help us any way they could - even if that had meant sending us someplace else. They are a total class act. If you're anywhere near Boston, you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't come by for a drink and dinner. You won't regret it.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Great cocktails here, very creative and 4/5 cocktails don't have a block of ice in it, hence me rating. You can order food or sit at the bar and order drinks. Came on a Fri night with a friend and sat at the bar. Drinks run normal city prices around $12-$13 and are pretty flavorful. The menu has mini pictures of the drink too give you a quick sense of what it will look like. The service was attentive and friendly as well. 1. Noble pursuit - Plenty of ice in this one but it was the smoking cinnamon stick which added aesthetic quality to it2. Lychee drink (forgot the actual name) - Unique, flavorful with a medium amount of alcohol and sweetnessOverall, I'll come back for more drinks with friends and to try their food.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"4,"So disappointed to have caught this popup just as they're on their way out of the Wink and Nod incubator! We had a great dinner there last week. Actually the best kind of dinner, which is ""order one of everything on the menu."" We did just that (and two of some things!) for our group of eight. After a few strike outs, we were delighted to find that Wink and Nod could accommodate our large group for a walk-in on Weds night. The ambiance was cool and dim, quiet enough to hear each other but not awkwardly empty. (We noticed a lot of swipe right situations around us, seems like a good place for a second or third date on a weeknight.)We were celebrating with a gluten-free gal, so you can imagine our delight when we learned that EVERYTHING on the menu was gluten free - even the calamari, made with tapioca batter! (As one of the fortunate gluten-tolerant folks, I can assure you that nothing was weird and I wouldn't have noticed it was gluten free.) Highlights for us were probably the cauliflower gratin and the chicken (though we were disappointed by the chicken's serving size, one leg for $28). We also loved the mushrooms and the brussel sprouts. The flank steak and other dishes I'm failing to remember were all fine. The only dish that wasn't scraped clean was a frisee-heavy salad. Everything was exceptionally flavorful and I would certainly return if the same group was going to be in the kitchen.My only word of caution, I'd stick to wine (or whisky!), as my last review from ~four years ago seems to still be accurate re: cocktails. The ones my friends had were all made with great intentions, but often fell a little flat and some were just too sweet.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"2,"Cool atmosphere, but disappointing everything else. Wink & Nod looks like a lot of other speakeasy themed bars in Boston. Partially below ground, dark-moody lighting, full bar at the center. The cocktails I tried were not very enjoyable, especially for $15. Not sure if it was an issue with execution or the recipe, but I definitely wouldn't order what I tried again. As an example, La Paloma was an over complicated an inferior version of a straightforward cocktail. It just didn't taste good. Serving it with a full-sized straw on a red wine glass was odd.The pop-up kitchen idea is interesting. Â The beef hummus plate tasted fine, but for a dish clearly meant to be shared, serving it with just two pieces of bread is bizarre. What was most disappointing about my visit though was the service. The wait staff was mostly friendly and efficient, but the restaurant must have some strange rules that I don't quite understand. I was with a group in one of the areas with couches and standing space. I went to the bar to ask for some water. The bar and the restaurant was mostly empty, and yet got some surprising sass from the bartender about how I should only order through the wait staff. Maybe you can't just walk up to the bar and order stuff from the bar in a bar . I don't know. Also, even though I originally came with a group, I was interested in getting a separate table for dinner. Asked the staff, apparently all the tables were reserved. I was in the bar for 3 hours or so and the restaurant remained 80% empty the whole time. Again, I don't know, maybe only some tables are actually open for dinner. Wasn't offered a spot at the bar or anything. Overall, Wink & Nod may cool, but I don't think the price, service, and food are worth it. Conveniently, many other spots in the city look almost exactly the same and offer a better experience.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"2,We came here on a Saturday night for drinks and the experience wasn't too great. Nobody liked thier cocktails (they were all strangely too sweet and too alcoholic tasting all at once) and the waitstaff did not seem to pleased to be serving us.,Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"5,"FULLY ENAMORED WITH WINK & NOD! - remember this when you go: ""Thank God It's Islay""Beautiful, hidden space with the large speakeasy vibe in South End.

Zoe, our waitress, was a gem; so friendly and knowledgeable. I had 3 different cocktails and enjoyed so, so much each and everyone one of them. My #1 was ""Thank God It's Islay"" - Obsessed!!! The other 2 delicious libations were: ""the noble pursuit"" and a ""bartender's choice with scotch base- oh yeah!We also ordered some Pintxos and was a great pic for something light yet savory to have with cocktails.

So I guess the vibe helps.Sacred Ruby : Â sosoTwo Sparkling Pinot Noir : Love it And a lower-end liquor Thank God It's Islay : sosoFood wise,I got the Brussel sprouts for appetizer which was insanely salty, taste like they have a serious overdose of soya sauce.Entree wise,We got the Chicken leg, yum but a bit small.We also got the chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert, nom nom.Would definitely go back if I want a deep talk with anyone",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"4,"Guess I should have read some Yelp reviews first...might have kept us from walking past the place a couple of times! But, it's worth it when you descend into the dark, speakeasy vibe. Really cool atmosphere and a bar I'd be happy to hang out in. We were there for dinner so we ended up in a corner table in the elevated section above the bar. Very cozy and quiet. Love the pop up kitchen concept. The theme of the kitchen for our visit was Spanish tapas. Started with drinks. Three of us ordered the Heat Mizer. Vida Mezcal, Orgeat, Lemon, Mole Bitters, Ginger Beer and a Seared Padron Pepper. I say ""a"" pepper because they put a whole pepper in the drink. Awesome garnish and tasty too! The overall balance of smokey and spicy was perfect. The Malbec and Tempranillo were good as well. For small plates, we tried the Truffle Pave, Fall Gourds and Roasted Mushrooms. All 3 were excellent. Servings were decent, but definitely tapas-small (ish). The Pave was exceptional. Great flavor and texture. Highly recommend it. Mushrooms sounded great and were good...but not as great as I'd hoped. For a medium plate, we got the special for the evening and damned if I can remember what it was now 24 hours later. No reflection on the quality, total reflection on my poor memory. Or possibly a reflection of my significant mescal intake over the course of the evening. Large plate was the Ribeye. Very well cooked. Tasty, but for $36 I thought there might be a bit more of it. We got the almond cake and chocolate torte and both were good. Service was very good and all in all, while expensive, I'd go back next time we're in town. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"2,"The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the excellent service (our waitress was so sweet). Otherwise the food was bad and the drinks sub-par. We were seated in an corner of the restaurant where there really shouldn't have been a table. It was right next to the kitchen with waiters constantly going in and out. Who would want a $50+ per person dinner seated next to the kitchen?? For food, We got the chickpea frites (which were honestly very very good) and it just went downhill from there. We got the cauliflower hummus which had such sour lemoney cauliflower it ruined the dish. I usually love cauliflower but it was done very badly in the hummus; the pita was very fresh and good though. We then got the lamb shank- HORRIBLE. for a $32 dish, I expect some flavor and well cooked meat. Really really really bad. I hate to be explicit- but I vomited at home for 30 minutes because of this food. There must have been something wrong because that does not happen often to me. For drinks, I don't remember what they were called, but they were too strong with little flavor other than alcohol. All photos attached! Maybe I can try the restaurant again once a different chef comes. Hopefully they seat us in a better area.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"3,"I like the restaurants concept but it seems faulty. This would be my second time trying this place out and the food is always just okay. Although I will say the cocktails and ambiance are on point. Â  This last time we went they had a Spanish/Portuguese chef in which we ordered the pomegranate brussel sprouts, squid in squid ink, olives, and the cheese plate. Brussels sprouts and olives were okay but the squid was more so fried vegetables in squid ink and the cheese plate was the saddest cheese plate one may ever come across. The cheeses were not well kept, but the presentation was a disaster - cheses were merely thrown on a plate with a hand full of cashews.

I. Love. Indonesian. Food. They asked if we had a reservation and we didn't but we were seated right away and there were a lot of open spots. The space is quite lovely, with comfy booths and cute nooks for a great first date, but we were seated near the bar where it was very loud. It was hard to hear my friend across the small table.The cocktail menu looked great but my friend and I didn't feel like drinking. Once the waitresses realized we weren't getting drinks, I think she stopped paying attention to us at all. My glass was empty for most of the hour we were there, and when our food came, we got the gado gado, the portions were very small. The flavors were great, but I was still hungry. I asked for the menu and when what I thought I wanted wasn't on it, I sort of asked for a recommendation (which I feel like they should want to do anyway!) and my waitress was not helpful.TLDR; The food was well balanced and flavors were authentic, portions were small, service was mediocre in a beautiful space.

Music plays in the background quiet enough to appreciate conversation. The interior is spacious with chique decor and furniture. The atmosphere is chill, calm, and collected. Quality Chef Aaron was running the culinary show in the kitchen with his Pareja Spanish concept. We ordered the pork belly, scallops, and Brussels sprouts. They were each some of the best tasting we've ever had. The pork belly was so tender that it falls apart in your mouth. The Brussels sprouts were glazed and flavored so well that it was a delicacy. Nice showcasing of molecular gastronomy too. Chef himself greeted us and chatted more about his story and concept. Truly personalized. Behind the stick was Julian, a passionate mixologist ready for conversation and creation. He's knowledgeable, precise, and welcoming. Cocktails tasted great with balance and flavor. It's exciting to see the menu rotate every few months - can't wait to see what's in store next! Execution Flawless. The entire team at Wink & Nod made us feel like a guest of their home.

Their burgers are what burgers should desire to be: huge, juicy, and topped with your guilty pleasures to make for a hearty and fattening meal. Their menu is impressively extensive--with some creative and crazy combinations that will leave you wishing that you had enough stomach space to eat all the burgers you want instead of having to make the hard choice of choosing only one. My friend and I were so intrigued by some of the combinations that I can't count the number of times we asked out loud ""do those ingredients work well together?!"" Some combinations seem to be pure genius while I wonder if others are just a haphazard combination of ingredients that lack clarity and direction. Â But hey, that only means I gotta come back to find out!! Â  For this visit, I ordered the Killer Bee, which I found to be really good! The burger is topped with onion rings and bbq sauce, making for a tangier burger--which I personally love. Together with super crunchy chips and a side of coleslaw, the meal was very hearty and super filling. While this is a meal my gym instructor would frown down upon, my burger satisfied all my fatty cravings and I could not be any happier.

My experience at Boston Burger Co. fell short of expectations. The only saving grace was the #FreakFrappe (aka crazy milkshake). My boyfriend and I ""joined the waitlist"" through Yelp and was quoted about 30 minutes. We came in and were told there would still be a wait, so we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. We ordered a cider and a beer on tap. It was all good and fun until the bartender went to pour another beer and the tap exploded on my boyfriend, me and the woman next to me. The bartender did not apologize, but just handed us napkins. A bit odd, but we were seated for food shortly after. We ordered an All American burger ($12) and a Frappe ($9) to split (One of the previous monthly flavors so I'm not sure the name - It had churros and a choco taco inside!). They have some crazy burgers on the menu, but we wanted to keep it somewhat simple (bacon, bbq sauce, blue cheese, cheese, lettuce, tomato). We asked for the burger to be cooked medium rare; what we received was medium well/well done.

The service was slower than I'm used to but still good and the food came out at an reasonable amount of time. The cool thing about this place is that they have no idea what a ""normal"" hamburger is. I had the ""420 burger"" which was a thick burger topped with mozzarella sticks, fried Mac and cheese, onion rings, French fries, bacon, bbq sauce and American cheese. There was nearly too much on this burger to be able to get it in my mouth. If I had it to do over, I would definitely get a side of the fried Mac and cheese because some of that fell off my burger and it was delicious by itself. The fries probably didn't need to be in there because with all the other flavors, they were relegated to being just filler texture that I didn't need. Overall it was good burger and something I wasn't used to. One thing I would love to try but was too full for after that burger is the FreakeFrappe.

The all American burger comes with bacon, shredded lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, creamy blue cheese and cheddar cheese. It was a homerun. Â You can have it with two sides: beans or slaw.

I came for the milkshake, but the burger floored me. One burger and milkshake between two people is plenty of artery-clogging food for the hour! The 420 burger had more fried objects in it than I've ever eaten at a time in my life. I could barely finish half of it after I shared a milk shake. The shakes are an experience to eat--i found myself scraping bits off the plate. Dipping the shortcake in the milkshake is essential!I will definitely be coming back to try more burgers and shakes.",Boston Burger Company - Boston,"1100 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,Went here for the first time today! Let me just tell you the burger selection is insane. The vibes and atmosphere alone are so much fun! I got the bacon and cheese loaded fries and of course an iconic milkshake. The milkshakes alone are worth going for... filled to the brim with deliciousness! My friends and I all got different flavors and would definitely go back again!,Boston Burger Company - Boston,"1100 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"Let me preface this review by saying- I am NOT a burger girl. What can I say? They're just not my thing. That being said, the Vermonster with some garlic Parmesan fries and a beer at BBC may be one of my favorite meals ever.These are not your average burgers. BBC offers innovative selections with ingredients you would never dream of putting together but somehow work wonderfully. These burgers are unique, tasty and always cooked to your liking. Did I mention the garlic parm fries? Seriously. They're mouth watering.",Boston Burger Company - Boston,"1100 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"3,"If burgers were an alcoholic drink, and you can be as creative as possible, then Boston Burger Company would be the bartender. Boston Burger Company has crazy burger concoctions. I have to tip my hat to the chef because you would have to be high on something to come up with these creative combinations. The burgers you order are huge! They are the smash it down type so that you can fit them in your mouth. Which they should be since I'll be paying $11 - $15 for one, I better be leaving full. Each burger will come with sides. I believe your choices were extra potato chips, beans, or cole slaw. We came with a party of 14 or so on a Wednesday lunch. Luckily we beat the lunch rush and the hostess was able to set up our party in the back of the restaurant. I ordered the Waikiki Beach Burger. A hamburger with grilled pineapple (YAS), ham, bacon (oh baby), and covered in teriyaki sauce. I have to admit that the ham made the burger a little more salty than I would've preferred but it does bring in the salty flavor profile. My friends ordered The Artery Clogger, The 420 Burger, and The Rundown. All of the burgers looked great! Definitely went for a long walk after our meal. Just to top it off, we ordered a #FreakFrappe to share. Again.. the creativity is off the wall here! We decided on the S'more than you can handle. (see photo). It was a delicious ending to a delicious meal. Oh and they serve beer. Gotta get that beer!!",Boston Burger Company - Boston,"1100 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"5,"Came here last night for the first time with my husband and a friend. I got the Mac attack burger and they both got the hot mess burger. Everything was super delicious, oh my goodness. And the chips they have were super crispy with a nice bite to them, you can tell they're homemade. Can't wait to be back",Boston Burger Company - Boston,"1100 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"4,"I recently moved to Boston, so after a morning of seeing the city, I was famished and looking for a good place to grab a quick lunch. I found this spot, and blindly entered without reading any reviews. Since it's located in the touristy area of the city (and it was lunch hour), the restaurant was pretty busy when I came in, so I had to wait a few minutes in a really tight area to get a table (which I didn't really mind).Nonetheless, I must say I lucked out, since the food and service was fabulous, and fairly priced. I ordered the salmon and feta toast, which I highly recommend. Will definitely come back.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"3,"Brunch wasn't bad. Toast was a little on the burnt side, eggs were left a little too long on the flattop, potatoes had obviously been cooked an hour or two before.Tasted alright and the price point wasn't bad - would have been better if care had been taken during the cooking process.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"3,"I typically enjoy eating here. In fact, I enjoyed 50% of my meal here this past weekend. The Cauliflower appetizer was amazing and I would have had that 3 times over if I had know my entree was going to be so disappointing. I had been craving ramen for awhile, so I was pleasantly surprised that they had a Ramen Bowl on the menu. I suppose I should have been suspicious of a place that isn't not known for their Ramen dishes, but I have never been disappointed in their food before, so I chanced it. Too bad my chance didn't pan out. So this is more of a warning not to get this specific dish...When ordering a Ramen bowl, one would expect to eat Ramen noodles. At the Granary Tavern you will find yourself eating a giant bowl of spaghetti. Actual spaghetti. The texture threw me off from the start. The pork in the bowl was decent, but the rest of the ingredients were subpar. And to make matters worse, the broth, the part I love the most, was a let down too. I gave this review 3 stars because half of my meal was delicious. But it's always disappointing to end a meal on a not so great entree. I will still go back to this place, but I won't be getting this meal again.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"3,"We made a reservation & had a decent meal. Â Honestly, it was nothing special. Â My burger was $16 and the patty was right off the Sysco truck. Â The roll and cheese were good but overall it wasn't anything special. Â The fries were odd because almost all the pieces were less than an inch long. Â My wife's tagine was good but by the end of it, she was really getting tired of the spice.The atmosphere is nice and we sat in the basement. Â It's a bit quieter and you can really see the amazing construction of the old building. Â The server was nice enough and got the order right, but she sort of forgot about us at the end of the meal. Â The restaurant is generally clean though the table really should have been wiped down before they seated us.I have a hard time thinking of the Granary Tavern as anything more than okay and that's worth three stars.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"2,"Absolutely everything about this place was average. Â I dropped it two stars because the service was below average and because they charged $4 for a cup of black coffee. Â They don't have the drink prices on the menu and then they slap you with a $4 fee for one cup of joe. Â I don't know why anyone would come here when if you're already going downtown, there are so many better options. Â I could make myself the same food at home for a quarter of the price. Â Do yourself a favor and pick a different brunch spot.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"4,"Great place for a quick, semi-casual dinner! We're in Boston for the first time this weekend and decided to check out this place before catching a trolley tour. Our order came out about 10 minutes after we ordered. My friend and I got the Granary Burger and fish and chips, and both were delicious! The breading on the fish and chips was a little flaky, but the homemade tartar sauce was really excellent. Would definitely recommend to other people looking for a decent meal in a great tourist location.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"4,Great location near the aquarium. Â Lively place with two floors. Â TV's everywhere to watch the Sox! Â Varied menu and fast service. Try the Bang-bang cauliflower appetizer. Â Awesome! Â We had the fish & chips and it was excellent! Â Super hot and good cole slaw. Â Fun for groups and good music playing. Definitely a young vibe. Â Make reservations on busy nights.,Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Make sure to get the chicken and waffles here, they were great! They also have hot water in the bathroom sinks which is fantastic! We didn't even have to wait to be seated; the service and food are amazing! Very great tavern!",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"2,"We stopped by this restaurant hoping to enjoy a nice dinner and the patio. The atmosphere was indeed lovely, and the meal overall was delicious. However, I was surprised by the quality of service. We did not have silverware on our table, and when I went inside to ask, a woman yelled at me and told me to wait. As a customer just hoping to enjoy my dinner while it was hot, I really think this was out of line. Overall, was disappointed by this experience, and probably won't return.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"3,Nice atmosphere and service was food. My appetizer and entree came out at the same time. My entree (lobster ravioli) was under cooked. My wife's first choose ( hanger steak) was bland. Her second choice ( pork) was way over cooked. Â Cooking execution was lacking extremely.,Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"4,"I came here on NYE for my birthday and there wasn't much of a crowd. The staff was very kind and courteous. I didn't say anything about an occasion because I wasn't sure if anyone was going to sing anything. I liked the atmosphere as well. They also had coat racks for hanging jackets which is neat and it was free standing and in a hallway so not hanging over anyone's head.They had a special menu for NYE that involved a lot of lobster but I opted not to get it because I didn't think I'd be able to finish everything. I got the scallops and bacon risotto and boyfriend got the open faced chicken sandwich. My dish was a lot smaller than I expected. It was 6 scallops surrounding a chunk of rice. I got a little confused because I couldn't find any bacon but then realized it was seared onto the scallops. It tasted great to me. The risotto itself could've used more flavor but it was delicious. I loved the sauce too and just wish there was more. I think the price was decent but at the end of the meal, I just wasn't really full. Ordered dessert afterwards and got some sort of lemon-y dessert if I remember correctly. Great and sweet but after eating half of it, it was just too strong, ended up having to leave it there. I think I'd come back to try other dishes here.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"4,"I've been here multiple times now and and every time I've consistently enjoyed the experience and the food. Â It's usually pretty easy to get a table since the restaurant is very large with tons of seating but they also take reservations.The restaurant has a nice, rustic ambiance and in the summer you can enjoy eating on the patio. Â There's a mixture of high tables, low tables and booths. Â It's a little weird because there are two entrances but IMO the back of the restaurant looks like the front from the outside so when you walk in, you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the hostess stand. Â Brunch here has been consistently good. Â I've ordered the eggs Benedict on multiple occasions and have been very happy with my meal. Â They have a Bellini bar for $30 that comes with 3 different types of juice mixtures. Â It's been different every time but all have been good! Â I've also had the French toast and everyone at the table raved over how amazing good they were.Dinner here is also good and there are a few more unique options than just your typical tavern type food. Â Definitely worth stopping in if you are in the area!",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"2,"Greeted by a hostess that lack hospitality. Once seated we were promptly greet with waters. We placed our children's order immediately, which came out fast. Overall the food was out quickly but lacked flavor. Â The fries were the only part of that was tasty. The server took forever to come back with the check. The management team helped bus the table- stacking dirty dishes on our table... Priced fairly but will not go back with so many other options available.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"1,"Attempted to eat here at 4pm. Absolutely horrible hostess refused to seat our party of 6 because ""we're not seating parties of that size without a reservation."" Â It's 4pm! Are you kidding?! There were only 4 tables occupied. Never will be back. Lost a customer. Hope they enjoy their arrogance.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"5,"Food was very good. I had the Hot Lobster Roll and a cup of the Clam ""Chowdah"". Both excellent! But what stood out was the staff. Excellent service!!! They were all very friendly. I'll be back here for sure.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"2,"Yelpers, I'm a simple man. Â I don't ask for much, maybe a side hot sauce that isn't Tabasco, an occasional swapped side. Â And I think it's totally reasonable that if you're going to have 1/3 of your brunch menu taken up by various interpretations of eggs benedict, you should know how to make one.Granary has three benedicts, 13, 14 and 19 dollars, respectively, and does not know how to make one. Â Their interpretation of a benedict is hard boiled eggs on toast. Â Really actually not bad tasting, but it's not what I ordered, and if I can make the same thing while hungover and half-asleep, then it ain't $13.I know, it's nitpicky. Â But if you're going to make it like your restaurant's middle name is Benedict, then you better step up.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"4,"I came here for the fish and chips. The cod was very fresh and delicious. On the other hand, I had just been to Alaska so I have had better cod. The breading is thicker than I usually like. I prefer flakier breading that is similar to the texture of a croissant. Nevertheless, the fried batter had a good crunch to it. Overall, I definitely recommend Granary Tavern if you are looking for some very good fish and chips in Boston. Â The other food looked tasty too. From the outside, the tavern looks like a warehouse but the dÃ©cor is very pretty inside as a sit down restaurant.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary. You can also find the electronic copy through the link my profile.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"3,"Meh. Â That's the most I can say... took about ten mins for someone to notice we were waiting to be seated. Â When he finally did we asked to sit outside which they obliged us. Menu had a good selection of different types of food ranging from chicken and waffles to pizza. Â Beer looked flat and wasn't really that cold, plus, considering it is a tavern, you would think they'd have more options on tap. Â They didn't even offer Sam Adams on tap... Â we ended up only getting the garlic chips which were greasy and garbage. Â Nice little pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl. Â It's almost like they were looking for a way to charge $9 for a bowl of chips. Â Food looked prettier than it tasted. Â I won't return...",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"2,As to the drink selection the Granary Tavern provides a great array of cocktails. Yet the food has been consistently dissapointing. From breakfast & dinner arrangements here the portion and the prices don't add up. Kudos to the wait staff for keeping up on an extremely busy Friday night and Saturday morning.,Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"1,"First to worst sadly.Granary used to be our go to spot - perfect for drinks and delicious bar food.Sadly it is the worst now. Service is awful - took 20+ min to get our drinks and another 20-30 to get some simple apps. The beer we ordered was totally flat. Sent it back and got charged for it anyway. The food is even worse. I don't know what the new chef is thinking, but everything we loved is gone. Some items like the bang bang cauliflower (which used to be amazing) are still on the menu but taste totally different. Other items are double the price (garlic chips!) and our favorites (pulled pork flatbread, chicken fried chicken!!) are gone. We also got a flatbread which was super bland and way overpriced - would've been better of with a frozen pizza. RIP to the old Granary - we'll miss you dearly. Ps- It pains me to write this because this was literally our favorite place in Boston before and we've been here countless times. Too many other good spots near by to waste your time and money here.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"5,"I came here with my boyfriend to celebrate one of our first anniversaries in Boston and we were thoroughly pleased. Because it was a date night, we were seated close together which really solidified the romantic vibe for the evening. Our waiter was extremely attentive and helpful when we asked for recommendations. We had decided to split the polpo (grilled octopus) for our appetizer which was amazing, I highly recommend it along with the sweet corn as a side. For entrees, I had the maine lobster gnocchi while he had the veal. Both were solid however we weren't overly impressed. Nonetheless, our overall experience exceptional and I would definitely come back again.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"Went on a Wednesday night for a business dinner. Â When we arrived at 6:00pm the place was empty and we were wondering if we picked a bad location - by 6:30pm the place was PACKED! Â The restaurant had a nice, trendy vibe and the waiter was pleasant albeit a little scattered! We ordered several different things so I will review each here:-Tuna tartare - fresh and delicious. Â Could have used a touch more chili oil but that could have just been my bite.-Arugula salad - delicious, but I LOVE Arugula. Â I thought it was plated beautifully with the manchego cheese on the bottom. Â Yummmm. Â -Meatball and homemade noodles - probably the star of the night for me. Â It was light and delicious.... next time I will likely order the entree version of this. -Halibut - the fish was very bland. Â The sauce and veggies it was sitting in way upstaged the actual fish and that is just sad. Â  Â We were too stuffed to try the desserts but the menu looked promising! Â Will return for the meatballs.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Came here on a Thursday night for a friend's birthday dinner. I made reservations for a party of 5 a few days prior -- there weren't any options online at a reasonable hour, but I was able to snag a prime spot at 7pm when I called. Reservations highly recommended.Food-wise: Their complimentary bread was delightful -- it came out fresh and warm. I ordered the gnocchi with Vermont lobster. The serving size was small (not like the generous portions that you get at Italian restaurants in the North End) with only a few pieces of lobster. What they lacked in quantity, they made up for it in quality. Each bite was just perfect -- somehow both comforting and light. Two of my friends ordered the Macchorenchelli (the most popular selection according to our server) -- which to put it simply is a pasta dish with beef meatballs. This was also delicious.The service was attentive, helpful, and friendly.The real standout about this place is the BEAUTIFUL interior. No wonder Zagat rates this place as ""Best Restaurant Decor."" We were immediately won over by the sky high ceilings, romantic lighting -- the place is modern, sleek, tasteful. A great spot for a special dinner. Pricey. Dress up a little to blend in with the ambience. Now I'm curious about their sister restaurant -- Mistral!Note: If you uber to this address, you'll be led to an apartment/condo. Take a right at the entrance of 1 Huntington (towards Dartmouth) to the corner of the building for the restaurant.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"One of my favourite spots in Boston. Beautiful restaurant with a lovely vibe. Very romantic as well. Amazing food with extreme attention to detail. Absolutely perfect!

Delicious wines & desserts as well.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Sorellina - Boston , Massachusetts - 9/28/2017Part of the Columbus Hospitality Group. I've been to several of their restaurants. Each one is a little different. What remains consistent is unparalleled customer service. I could sit here for hours and just watch them do what they do.For my first course this evening, the Polpo ... grilled octopus, squid ink cous cous, cherry peppers, finocchio... The plating was something to behold... It was like a work of art! The Octopus was perfect. I'm also a huge fan of squid ink. This was the first time on cous cous, normally I have It on linguini Pasta.And to my surprise, the Chef sent out the Mafaldine... market exotic mushrooms, truffle butter, Pecorino Toscano. This is probably the most interesting Pasta I've ever had. Long ornamental Pasta... It really holds the sauce beautifully. And like everything thing the do, house made...My main course, the Halibut... East Coast, romanesco cauliflower, lobster mushrooms, uni Crema... Yet another masterpiece... It looks so good, you almost feel guilty eating it... I said almost! The thinly sliced cauliflower was the perfect touch with just the right amount of crunch.Ordinary I would pass on dessert however knowing the caliber of what comes out of the kitchen, I selected the CIOCCOLATO... Warm molten chocolate cake, vanilla bean gelato and my signature Cappuccino...What an amazing evening!

I will be returning for this. Ribeye and Caesar salad were well executed. I could have used smaller and more croutons on the salad but they used just the right mount of dressing and the flavors were nicely balanced. Lemon pudding for dessert was heavenly. Service at the bar was affable and efficient. Overall worth checking out!,Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Tucked away on Huntington Ave, Sorellina was a real gem for a special meal. My boyfriend and I booked reservations for my birthday and were seated in a cozy corner at the back of the restaurant.Our waitress was phenomenal and so, so, sweet. The table next to us seemed to be regulars and chatted with the waitress like old friends.I judge Italian restaurants pretty harshly by their complimentary bread and the ciabatta here was just perfect. Super warm, super soft, and super delicious with the butter. We went through a loaf each with no regrets. The White Pearl was a refreshing and fruity cocktail that wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, which I loved.For food we ordered the burrata and a half order of campanelle as appetizers, myself the lobster gnocchi, and my boyfriend the filet. The burrata was very delicious, though at a steep price point of $27. I would trade it out for another half sized pasta if I were to visit again. The pasta dishes were great--the butter sauce on the lobster gnocchi was not too heavy at all and did not leave any buttery film feeling in my mouth. My boyfriend enjoyed his filet, which they charred to perfection with a light smokey taste.What really took me by surprise was the fact that our waitress brought out a small serving of gelato for us with ""happy birthday"" decorating the plate. I was quite surprised that they took the time and effort to do that, especially as all we did was mark down that the meal was for a birthday on Open Table. My boyfriend loved it and openly admitted that he's not that thoughtful and hadn't requested it himself.All in all a really nice meal with great ambiance. It's definitely on the fancier side and we felt slightly underdressed until we saw a guy in a Pats jersey!",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"We had a great business meal here. From the cost check to the hostess, from the manager to server, top notch service. The restaurant was packed on a Thursday evening.

MACCHERONCELLI - American Wagyu beef meatballs, Montepulciano sauce and Parmigiano, delish POLPO - grilled octopus, squid ink cous cous, cherry peppers, finocchio, was delicious.CARPACCIO - Prime Sirloin, black truffle puree, Matsutake mushrooms, lemon aioli was solid.VEAL - ""saltimbocca,"" prosciutto, maitake mushrooms, truffle whipped potato - just perfect SCALLOPS - Georges Bank, celery root, black truffles, onion-sherry marmellatata - Boston ScallopThe food is solidly good but pricier than other Restos in the area.

The service is professional and top notch. I will personally vouch that Sorellina has some of the best oysters in Boston - convince me otherwise.

I have come here many times over the years for all different occasions, with friends, with family, on a date. The setting is romantic and the room is beautifully decorated making it feel modern but still warm. It is a high end, expensive restaurant, but well worth it for the quality in my opinion.The service is always exceptional, I've had some of the best waiters here. The menu has a nice selection and I've tried quite a few things on it. The gnocchi is unbelievably out of this world. Everyone I've gone with that has tried it has fallen in love. Â It is so buttery with fresh lobster, absolutely divine. For entrees I loved the scallops and also the halibut, so delicious and fresh. The chicken is very good and the lamb chops are very tender and flavorful, it almost melts in your mouth. The artichokes, truffle fries and whipped potatoes are my favorite sides, they are so tasty! Don't forget dessert, they have a great menu. I've had the crostata and the sugar donuts as well as the warm chocolate molten cake.... just wow! Unbelievable desserts. The whole menu is amazing and the experience in this place is memorable every time I visit. I will continue to come here, it's a great spot for special occasions.

This restaurant is fantastic! From the food to the decor to the service, it's all excellent. I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. The quality of the food is phenomenal. The flavors of the dishes are worth writing home about. The service is top notch. The wine list is expansive and with great choices. I'd love to eat here more often than I do.

I'm confident that you'll be happy.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"4,"We came to Sorellina in the darkest day of the blizzard. God hurled justice down from the skies unto the sinful Boston until it piled up along the road and hardened into ice on the streets. 400 years of deadly winters and technological advancement did little to prepare the town for such a wrath.We ate a couple of things.Lobster and Gnocchi. This was exquisite. I loved how I could scarcely distinguish between the lobster and gnocchi in the low-lighting, so every bite became a surprise. Would a piece of gnocchi cave to the pressure of my jaw, or would lobster perhaps spring back for a chewy descent to nothing?Wagyu beef meat balls. These tasted great and the pasta underneath it was all the way dente.Foie Gras. This was a little disappointing. I realize now that foie gras is best seared on the outsides so that it becomes gooey on the inside. Served cold and in a shape that looked like it came out of a can just makes the mouthfeel less pleasant.Finally I had a dish of veal. This meat was incredibly tender and juicy, and there was something wrapped around it that was seared and gave a good counterpoint to the meat itself. I highly recommend trying it out if you get a chance!One downside to the restaurant is that it seemed a little bit stuffy. I get that it's very formal dress, but in times of need (like this blizzard from hell) did we really deserve a sideways glance from the host from not wearing a suit; not some formal shoes?",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"I came here on a Friday night according to my friend's recommendation. We have Foi Gras and oysters for our appetizers. The Foi Gras comes with fruits on the side. The fruits perfectly neutralize the oily taste. In addition, the raw oysters comes with ingredients. The fishy taste is completely avoided by the sour taste of lemon juice and the bitter taste of the ingredient. As for the main course, I highly recommend the veal. This course is not like normal veal dishes which come with a side. This course uses mashed potato as sauce at the base which completely mixed the soft taste of the veal. I ordered a Japanese whiskey for my dessert. The best thing for it is that they use a perfect rounded ice ball inside the drink so the drink won't get diluted swiftly.This place is worth to be patronized.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"3,"My family of 7 came to Sorellina for my graduation dinner. We read raving reviews and we were excited to try this place. Our server was wonderful, really a nice and accommodating guy. Overall the staff were very friendly. The food was good, but my husband did have an issue with his dish. There were several shell pieces in his dish. We informed the waiter and the manager came over to apologize. We weren't looking for a free meal by any means, but it would have been well respected to ask if he wanted another dish or to reduce the cost of a $50+ dish due to the lazy preparation. We were a little dissatisfied with that which is why I cannot give this place 4/5 stars. I had the salmon and that was tasty but the vegetables were not a good pair for the dinner. My aunt did have the meatballs for an appetizer and they were delicious and she said her steak was as well. So they do have a few very good dishes, but they have to work on improving their vegetable offerings and ultimately how they handle mishaps and lazy chefs in the kitchen. Something should be done to accommodate the guests. Like I said, not looking for anything free but some alteration would have been greatly appreciated and a nice gesture to make up for the mistake. Overall, our waiter was great, manager was just okay, and food is decent but pricy. We wouldn't return.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Sorellina gets a big fat five stars from me, and a sixth honorary star for impeccable service. We had a 6:30 reservation last night (Wednesday) for a large party of 15, taking some clients out who we love to try to impress. When we arrived, the previously agreed upon two-tables-next-to-each-other set up did not work for us, and we wanted to all be at the same table. Sorellina bent over backwards to accommodate us. Before even sitting down they were already impressive. They have Forever Young Malbec by the bottle, one of my favorites, and something hard to find in the Boston area. We started with a few bottles, and made our way into the appetizers. The salmon tartare and tuna tartare were delicious and super fresh. My all time favorite thing was the burrata, which I could have inhaled if I wasn't trying to be professional. We followed up with the meatballs and the gnocchi and both were drool-worthy. Hefty portion of lobster in the gnocchi for you shellfish lovers. For an entree - I had the filet, YUM. Their specialty is the veal Milanese, which my boss got and allowed me to try. Holy moly. As if we needed it, we ordered dessert and I have to tell you, you haven't lived until you've tried the little donuts (bombelina's I think). By then it was time for coffee and Bailey's, and naturally we shut down the restaurant with our happy, full group. From start to finish this was a fantastic experience. I will be keeping Sorellina in mind for all future special events. The service was fantastic, no glass was ever empty, and no plate was left uncleared. 10/10.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,Excellent service and great food. We came to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was a great night. They complemented us with gelato and wrote happy anniversary. The atmosphere is very nice and romantic.,Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"5,"Santouka has really great ramen! It is a small hole in the wall type of place but there's always a line out the door. The line does move pretty quickly and is definitely worth the wait.The ramen is all fresh and I really enjoyed by vegetarian dish. I got a soft boiled egg on the side for a small charge but it was worth it and was perfectly cooked. The regular portion size was plenty for me and the prices were reasonable here, especially for the popular touristy area.All of the waitstaff was attentive and very polite. I am looking forward to coming back here soon and highly recommend it to others!",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Was shopping on Newbury St and came across this GEM. The shop is relatively small, so there may be a bit of a wait outside. The prices range from $12-17 for a bowl. If you order a large, it's only an extra $1 (recommend). Tried the Kara Miso Ramen and I absolutely loved the broth!! The bowl appears small, but they give a decent amount of noodles. Satisfied my ramen cravings!Side note: only two pieces of pork belly came with it",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,Best ramen in town!!! The broth was amazing especially the miso broth. I love how the egg was half cooked on the inside. Everything was $15. My ramen bowl was small but it will cost more if you want an upgrade. The service was great even tho the wait was super long. TIPS: make reservation! The place can get pretty busyFOOD: 10/10SERVICE: 10/10PRICING: 8/10,Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"There's almost always a line outside the store, which is really small on the inside. The ramen is spectacular. They have a $15 combo with a regular size ramen (+1 for large and -1 for small), a side, and an egg. It's perfect if you want to try the ramen and some smaller dishes (and a pretty good deal). The Kara miso ramen was great. You can taste the spiciness, but the soup is definitely not overpowered by oil (I hate ""spicy soups"" that is overly oily). The egg had a soft yolk and was fantastic too. The service is really quick, as is the turnaround. The line goes pretty quickly, and the restaurant is definitely more of an eat-and-go rather than slow type.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Bless this ramen place! I visited in the heart of the winter during a short visit to Boston. Prepare for a line. Somehow on the evening we went, it wasn't as bad according to the others ahead of us who've waited longer in the past - it was about 20-30min for us. No list, just wait your turn in line for a spot to open inside. The space is small so it's not ideal for a group. Definitely a solo or 2-person outing at best. The service is quite speedy once we got in there, bringing out waters and taking our order ASAP. I had the miso ramen, added an egg (they upcharge for that, wish it was standard because soft boiled eggs in ramen are the best). The broth is so rich and flavorful. We don't have many great ramen places in Rochester so it was nice to get a well crafted dish here for comparison. If you're looking for a hearty bowl of ramen, this spot is a winner!",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"4,Delicious. Â The best ramen places that I've ever been to was of course in Japan but this come pretty close to it. Â Staffs were friendly and food was great. Â I tried a few ramen orders and they were all delicious. Â If you're in town and have an craving for ramen this is a great place to visit. Â I'm told there is always a line out the door and I did experience that but like all good restaurants there's always wait.,Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,Had Miso Ramen for lunch while my friends tried the Spicy Miso Ramen ang Shoyu Ramen. The line was a bit long but it's all worth it. The broth of the ramen was superb. The egg and meat was out of this world. The bowl wasn't that big but it's all perfect for your ramen cravings. I would love to eat here again with my friends. Definitely the best ramen in town!,Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Listen, you might be thinking, ""why am I gonna wait in line for maybe 20+ minutes for a bowl of noodle soup?"" And I feel you; it can be cold out there. But this isn't your average noodle soup. This isn't even your grandmother's noodle soup. This is better than that; this soup stares your Nana in the face and says, ""suck it, Nana, I'm better."" Becuase this place is just simple and incredible food, hands down. The Kara Miso ramen is exactly the right kind of spicy to make you feel warm and cozy and ready to take on whatever ailes you. The pork is so damn savory, and the broth is divine. You could swim in this broth; you could eat this broth for days and not get tired or hungry. It's like manna, it's heaven-sent. I can't speak more highly of the food. Certainly what I had. I will say that the service was also top quality and speedy, and the folks are super hospitable, arigato! My only issue was the weird, ambient, smooth jazz music. It's not what I expected. I like jazz, don't get me wrong. Some Coltrane or Miles Davis and I'm set. But the elevator vibes were bizarre. Verdict: you should've eaten here months ago. This is the restaurant you've been dreaming about. Do yourself a favor.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,I came here and it was SO good. I'll be honest- I amno ramen expert but the broth was flavorful and the meat was tender and I was full and happy why I was done. The meal was also cheap and the service was quickBe warned: this place is VERY small and there is almost always a wait especially at peak times,Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"4,"Tiny eat-in spot for delish ramen!I have walked by this place time and time again, seeing people standing outside waiting for some hot broth, a slice of pork, and noodles that promise a happy belly. My husband and I finally made it here for an early dinner on a Saturday night. We only waited about 15 minutes outside for a seat at community table. Santouka offers a few different ramen options and a few appetizers. I went for the shoyu ramen and was so happy they have the option of a small! I can never finish a regular size bowl so this was perfect.A few moments later we received our hot bowls of ramen goodness. My broth was rich and flavorful and the noodles were good (although, not the best I've had). The small was a perfect portion for me--I didn't feel I was stuffing myself to finish the dish.The staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean and tidy. Overall, a good experience for a quick dine in ramen restaurant in Boston.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Absolutely a hit! I'm a bit of an adventure junkie and as such, I love to pick a random city and explore it without to much planning. One of the benefits of doing this is that I get to try new things and unique foods or foods unique to said city (ie.. Boston cream pie) Naturally, this adventure was no different. My visit to Boston has given me life. I've walked the freedon trails and stood on the oldest commissioned Naval ship in the United States. The USS Constitution. Now, after a full day of touring, I decided to turn to Yelp to help me pick a great place to eat. I decided on a proper ramen noodles experience. The resturant is a small space but filled with amazing eye popping bowls of noodles. The staff kept to the crowd happy by taking and filling orders swiftly. I don't think I've ever been served so fast in all my life. So if your ever in Boston and you want what I like to call a proper ramen experience, I highly recommend this ramen gem.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Came here because I didn't want to ride the traffic to Harvard squareOverall, I enjoyed the service and the ramenRamen is well made, broth tastes great; and I love being able to see the cooks putting their heart and passion into making the food, it makes the food tastes much better for some reasonThe service was very friendlyMy only gripe was waiting in line, but I guess that adds to anticipation lol so it's all gucci",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"2,"So, I've had so many different experiences with Santouka. I've had it first as a pop up event at Itadaki in 2014. My boyfriend and I waited almost an hour for it and it was well worth it. It was one of our favorites and after having had tried it, we wished there was an actual one in Boston. A few years later (maybe a year or 2) they finally had their first location in Harvard Square.Excited, we come to the restaurant and it was packed. When we finally sat, we got the Char Siu, the best sounding option on the menu and the one that sounded the most reminiscent of what we had a few years ago at the pop up. To our dismay, it was way saltier than we remembered. The portion was pretty small compared to other bowls in Boston, and it was more expensive. I thought I was the only one who thought this, but my boyfriend said that that was his experience as well.So this brings me to the Back Bay location. Last month, me and my friend came here on one of the coldest days in Boston. As expected the line was out the door, for this location is significantly smaller than the Harvard Square location. Out of our minds, we decided to wait. We were sat in about 15 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. One thing that I did appreciate this time was that they were having a Hungry Student Offer. If you showed your student ID to the server, you would get a large ramen for the size of a small. So that was a nice surprise.I got the Char Siu ramen again. Also I couldn't believe that you had to pay for egg. I hate paying for adding an egg to ramen. It feels like buying water. Absolutely ridiculous. Think about it. Having it again confirmed my feelings. It was still pretty salty and the noodles weren't my favorite. I don't think I would give this place another chance.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"I came in midday on a Friday and the line was fairly short, we were able to get in within 45 minutes. The downside to the wait is that you can't put your name down and browse the shops along Newbury street while you wait for your table, you literally have to be in line the entire time. I think if I had to wait for any longer than 45 minutes, I wouldn't come back.Waiting times aside, the ramen was excellent! I ordered the vegetarian option and was surprised at how flavorful the broth and toppings were. It was traditional ramen done right. I have tried other spots in Boston and this one was definitely the top. If it wasn't for the wait, I would definitely come back.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"4,"Santouka was as a pleasant surprise -- the service was quick, friendly, and efficient, and the ramen was a great bowl with incredible soup, noodles, and toppings.As stated in other reviews, the restaurant is small with very few seats. I always see a long time formed outside but I didn't have to wait too long on a cold Friday afternoon (just five minutes.) The soup isn't too sodium-heavy so I didn't feel very thirsty afterwards. I can't wIt to be back for another bowl of casual ramen.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Arguably one of the best ramen places in Boston. There are two locations (Cambridge and Back Bay). You'll find long lines at both locations. I usually frequent the Back Bay as it is the more convenient of the two for me.Any of the ramens are good. I usually get the spicy one. I also make the ramen a combination lunch, which adds a bowl of rice (with a topping) and an egg. The food is prepared and gets to you pretty quickly.The seating is tight so make sure you make nice with your neighbor!",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"This place is probably the best ramen spot in all of Boston. Make sure to come at the right time (before noon in my experience) otherwise you can expect to wait a looong time to be seated. They only have about 15 seats total inside, it's not a very big space. I recommend getting the combo, it's totally worth it. You get a lot of food (especially if you go for a large ramen bowl, only $1 extra). I love the Cha-siu gohan side that comes with it. All in all a great spot for food despite the potentially long wait time",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"4,"After 30 mins of waiting in line, (thankfully it was a warm day!), we got inside and sat at the counter. The service is quick and the portions are filling! Love the pork belly and miso broth. I'm not a ramen expert by any means, but I can say this was a great meal! One recommendation that I'm sure they've heard before is: why not offer take out? There's always a line outside because of how small the area is, but they could generate so much revenue with all the colleges and residents nearby!",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"4,"When I first walked by this ramen spot and saw a line outside, I automatically thought in my head ""No. I am not waiting in the Boston cold in November for ramen."" But then I found out it's the same chain as the ramen place I frequent at Mitsuwa in Edgewater, NJ and was also craving ramen, so I thought, ok I'll give it a try.Through reviews and tips on Yelp, I knew that this place was small. Â When you go, you don't even go to the counter to let them know how many are in your party. You just wait in line. They won't seat you until your entire party is there, so if there's a single seat available and there's someone at the end of the line eating by himself, he gets bumped to sit inside. Â I waited about half an hour, but I also let two people go in front of me since my party was incomplete. If they were there with me when I got into line, it would have only been a 20 minute wait. Once we got in, the waiter was pretty prompt in giving us the menu. It took awhile in my opinion to give our order, but afterwards, we got our ramen pretty fast. Â I ordered the Tonkotsu cha shu ramen with a shio broth. Â The pork was very tender and the noodles were on point. I've always loved the ramen in Mitsuwa, so I knew it was going to be good. One thing that was new was that in the ramen was umeboshi (pickled plum). Â It was an excellent surprise that I enjoyed when I got to the bottom of the bowl. Santouka is also one of the few places where I actually drink the broth.I would definitely come back, but the waiting is annoying.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"4,"We were walking around Newbury street when my boyfriend and I saw a line forming outside this restaurant, so we decided to wait and see what's it's all about. We waited for about 30 minutes, so it wasn't too bad. This place holds about 20 people so the turnover is pretty high. This is how ramen shops in Boston operates, so eat and then leave quickly so others will get a chance to get through the doors! Location is prime. Super close to coffee shops, shopping area, and the vibe of the area is just super hip. Expect this area to be busy with cars and people on the weekends. Service: They were attentive and quick. I mean, it sorta makes sense in a high turnover place like this. Â No complaints here. Decor: minimalistic and functional. One unisex restroom that was very clean. Their floor was also surprisingly very clean, considering how busy they are. You don't really get to choose where you seat, but there are both a bar and tables to eat your ramen. You get to see them cook it through the glass window too. Food: I got a regular goma miso ramen and for highly recommend that! So yummy. My boyfriend got a large namban ramen. We both agreed that my broth was more flavorful, whereas the namban soup base is more subtle. Overall, this is a pretty solid ramen spot if you're in the area.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"5,"Had a great time at Sassafras last night!! I had made reservations here for my father in laws birthday. We were greeted by friendly faces. The restaurant itself was adorable decorated with a homely, clean feel.Since this is a vegetarian and vegan restaurant, if you want real cheese with your meal or fake cheese, you have an option. Since we aren't vegan, we opted for real cheese and ordered the following:1.) Mac and cheese fried balls (5 stars) 2.) Bon me pizza (5 stars)3.) Impossible Big Mac Burger with fries (4 stars)4.) Spaghetti Eggplant Parmesan (came with garlic knots) (4 stars)5.) Chocolate Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake (5 stars)The food was really good! The portions were doubled which explains the larger price tag on menu items. When we come here again, we will probably opt to share an entree. The Mac and cheese balls were so delicious and definitely an indulgence. I was impressed at how good the Big Mac was! I thought the accompanying French fries could have used more work though. The pizza was delicious and is a must order if you like veggies and want to try something different. It's tangy and savory. Note that the chocolate cake was not on the menu but since we had seen it on social media, we asked about it and they brought us some. The cake slice was the size of my arm!!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Internet eaters, it is fair to say that this place blew my mind. We were huge fans of the former incarnation, Eat at Jumbo's, and devastated by the change. Then again, I'm a sucker for a Phoenix rising from the ashes of delicious pizza. Jumbos always had great vegetarian/vegan options, so I was interested to see what their menu would be like when it focused completely on those options. The decor is fresh and inviting--hubby and I both loved the flatware and the wooden pieces adorning the brick walls. Every dish that came out evinced gasps of ooh and aah. The food is so pretty! Gorgeous plating and so many colors. We opted to start with the appetizer special, buffalo cauliflower 'wings', as well as housemade Arnold Palmers. The wings were battered and baked and just perfect. I think the Arnold palmers had jasmine or something floral in them. I really enjoyed mine!For our mains, my husband had the Mozambique chorizo and I had the seitan ribs with Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. I can't say enough about how good everything was! We chatted with the owner during our visit, and he shared that everything except the Impossible Burger (tm) is made in house. Incredible! We finished up with the peanut butter chocolate cake, which was a meal in itself. So good. No one would ever guess it was completely vegan. What a special new place!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"1,"Hello! So first off I am not one to write reviews or comment on service but I believe that my experience at Sassafras should be spoken about. Just a background about the situation is I am getting married in August of next year and reached out to Grover (the owner) to talk about catering. We had a sit down talk with my fiancÃ©, maid of honor, Grover and his catering manager Christopher. Throughout the process Grover was Â argumentative and not very helpful. Christopher on the other hand was amazing. He is the reason I still wanted to go with them. We made a menu for my wedding and they told me that they could work within my budget. I then waited two months to get a quote from them just to find out it was $600 over my budget when I was reassured it would not be. In the meantime my fiancÃ© and I went there for his birthday dinner and Grover kept telling me that they could take their time with the quote because my wedding was so far away. When I then stated again that I was concerned about the timeline he kept saying we have time and brushed me off. Once I said I would get in touch with Christopher, Grover made it very clear that he is the owner of the business and Christopher was just in an employee. I consider that to be very rude to put down your employees especially the one that helps with his business so much. I facebook messaged Grover (he didn't want to email) and Christopher saying my concern about how they were 600 dollars over budget. I then got no response until a week later when I message them again. In return I got a message from Grover giving me his number saying call me anytime I called you and no answer.... I replied with telling him I did not receive a phone call. He had called me on Facebook messenger because he did not want to look up my phone number to call my phone. Â When I didn't answer fast enough for him he messaged me again stating he will honor his quote (the one way to high) and not willing to try and bring it down, for 30 days starting today and encouraged me to look elsewhere for catering. I responded with how upset I was about the whole situation and how I have been treated and that I will take my business elsewhere. Later that day I received a phone call from Grover yelling at me trying to defend the pricing, also telling me at that price he would be losing money and asked if I think it would be right if he lost money on my wedding, he became so aggressive that I could not speak to him any longer and had to tell him I needed to get off the phone. Very shaken by this encounter I just paused for a minute to take in what had just happened. He then incessantly kept texting me to the point of harassment. I strongly urged him to stop contacting me and said I do not know how you were still in business when you treat customers this way. I am so sorry for the long post but I strongly suggest that you do not deal with such an unprofessional person who is willing to scream at his customer. I would like to say that Christopher was amazing and very professional this post was not made for him it was made to warn anyone that is thinking of going to or catering from Sassafras. It really sucks because their food is amazing and I am not the person to ever write a bad thing especially with a vegan restaurant but I had to let people know of how awful the owner treated me.",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Sassafras is a one of a kind restaurant. I stopped by before their renovations and rebranding to a vegan restaurant, and I can't get over the transformation. It is extremely exciting to watch a restaurant and group of people adapt to change and create something so unique. Their all vegan menu is the best I've seen. Vegan steaks, burgers, fish, fried eggs, and more. 100% vegan and fresh from their kitchen. The dedication they've put into this is extremely exciting for the vegan community and their food is fantastic -- vegan or not, anyone would enjoy I am thrilled to be close to Sassafras and continue to enjoy meals there!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"3,Excited by a new vegetarian/vegan restaurant and quickly stopped by. When I entered no staff were to be found and had to knock on the barn door to get someone's attention and when they showed they seemed affronted. Not a great first impression. Asked for a menu and was rather taken aback by their prices. Almost everything in the menu (desserts being the ONLY exception) was between $15-25. Chose not to eat there that evening so I can't review the food itself.,Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"2,"Good concept, poor execution. Famous seitan ribs were dry and had rubbery consistency. You could barely cut it with a knife. Tofu Mozambique was a few slices of tofu on a huge pile of French fries. Very subpar, especially for the price they charge. Customer service was not the best either. There were two available tables, one by the door, another by the window. They sat us by the door and refused to move us when we asked for a window table. I thought restaurant business was all about customer service. Will not come back, would not recommend",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Third time's the charm. Â I had the Big Mac and my boyfriend had the Supreme pizza.

Recommend the cold brew and OJ for bevs. I really appreciate that this place offers unique veg dishes - I'm excited to try dinner!,Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Went for a date tonight and had the good luck to be seated next to Grover (owner) who was engaging and informative. Husband had the fish sandwich and I got the buffalo cauliflower gyros, and we split a side of Mac n cheese. First off, portions are HUGE. And second, they taste amazing. Like, tears came to my eyes good. Even husband who is a hardcore carnivore adored it and polished off mine as well as his. All the staff was attentive and prompt with their responses. We were full but got dessert anyway. The nutterbutter chocolate cake is the stuff of dreams. Enough to feed at least 4 people, it's going to keep me happy for days. Simple and comfortable decor, loved the wooden cutting boards they use for serving. Make this your next meal out for sure!!!!",Sassafras,"688 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,Awesome Greek restaurant in Assembly Row which offers two dining experiences.... counter service or table service. Â The table service offers up a greater selection of food choices and alcoholic beverages.Came for a quick business lunch and ordered counter service. I ordered the kale salad with chicken and side cup of lamb chili. They were both excellent. Â The salad was made fresh to order and was presented in a huge bowl. The lamb chili was full flavored and loaded with chopped lamb meat. I would order both again.My colleague ordered a Gyro and said that it was the best he has ever had! Â Great addition to Assembly Row.Will definitely be back!,Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"4,"A surprising delicious find! My friends and I came on a random weekday night for dinner and between the 3 of us - shared the Olympian platter and were happily stuffed! The platter came with a mixture of lamb chops, chicken wings, kebabs, sausages, fries, Spanakopita, pita, and a cheesy spread! Everything was beautifully, artfully marinated and quality was top notch. My fave was definitely the lamb chops, and the next time I'm Â back I know I'm gonna go straight for the gold and only order the chops! The only thing I would've been happy to forgo would be the sausages. They simply paled in comparison to the other delicious meats! Drop by for a tasty, meaty meal!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Yes yes yes. As if there weren't already enough amazing restaurants in my area, I can now add Zo Greek to the list. I like that you can choose what kind of dining experience you want upon walking in. We stayed to the right near the dining and bar area which offers a larger menu and a slightly more formal experience.The waitress was an angel and let me try a couple of wines before I ordered. To start we had the spread sampler, the star of which was the Tzatziki. It was thick and creamy and served with yummy warm pita. In fact, the pita was so good that we decided against our original choice of ordering different meat skewers for dinner, and just went with Pork gyros. They were DELICIOUS and huge. I only ate half of mine and took the rest home. The fries that they were served with were also some of the most slammin' fries i've ever had. Think steak fries, but crispier and more delicious on that outside than your average. We'll definitely be back here!!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Opa! We had a 5-star-worthy Greek culinary experience at Zo on Saturday night.Upon entering, you are immediately tasked with a decision: veer left for the casual menu (pitas, rice bowls, etc) or turn right for the sit-down restaurant experience with extended menu.I want allll the options, so we go right and sit ourselves down. Our waitress soon comes over to hand us menus and explains that the meze plates all vary in size, so we can order a few to share. Also, for +$8 you can turn a meze into a dinner plate with salad + fries/rice. Good to know!After looking over all the options, we went for the dolmadakia (stuffed grape leaves), pastitsio (kind of like a Greek lasagna), and the locanico (Greek sausage) dinner plate.Our friendly waitress asked how we'd like the food to come out, and we said just as it's ready. So first to arrive were the dolmadakia. These were presented beautifully with a fresh lemon slice on top of the 4 grape leaf-wrapped rice bundles. The pool of olive oil they were bathing in was so delicious. The rice mixture had great herbs/spices, and the entire thing had a slight lemony flavor which was outstanding. These were happily devoured.The pastitsio came next, which is two pasta layers encasing ground beef a la lasagna. This creamy, hearty dish is the epitome of comfort food. The portion was quite big for a ""meze"" and the meat was spiced wonderfully. It's the kind of food you can't help but dig into.The locanico dinner with salad and fries was a great portion. The sausage had nice flavor, a bit smoky and charred and perfectly seasoned. The fries came out crispy & hot, and it was nice to have the Greek salad with feta, olive, cucumber, and tomato to balance things out.We left feeling full but still energized, not gross as you would typically feel after a large meal. And before we even left, we talked about returning to try more dishes and desserts. The Mediterranean diet is one of the best for you, and now I can see why -- you feel great and are also a happier person!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"ZO IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE GREEK FOOD IN MASSACHUSETTS! when I used to work in the financial district I would eat at Zo on state street and in government center every single week. I am so happy the opened a location at Assembly row.I really recommend their salads, rice plates, gyros, soups, spinach pie, and desserts. EVERYTHING from here is AMAZING. The customer service is always top notch. All the employees are always so friendly, nice, efficient, and very professional. This location also have a bar service with a special menu. All around 5 stars!!!! Best food, service, staff and drinks.",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Had a great experience at Zo. The place is very nice with beautiful windows (like the rest of assembly). Gf ordered a margarita that was surprisingly good.

Also our waitress was very sweet and attentive.",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Ok where do I begin!? We stopped in about a month ago for lunch (soup and gyros) and fell in love. Â I had the fasolada and she had the lentil. Â Since then we have returned numerous times on Sunday nights. Â We've had the Olympian (a plate filled with grilled meats and heaven) as well as Â the spanakopita and baklava cheesecake. Â The food is so fresh, flavorful and delicious but it's the atmosphere that has us sold. Â Coming from an Italian family, Sunday dinner is everything. Sadly time goes on and traditions change but this place has filled a void for me and my girlfriend. Â The family vibe, the friendly faces and conversation from owners and staff only elevate the quality of food. Â Did I mention the authentic Greek wines, beer, and cocktails? Tonight we left knowing that we have a new place for ""family dinner"" on Sundays. Thank you Zo! We love you!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"4,Awesome! I didn't know there's a bar area on the side. I got a chicken gyro and lentil soup.

I will be coming back to try some other stuff on the menu.,Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"YUM! I really didn't expect to like this place. The lines for Sunday brunch in Assembly Row were long, so we decided to just pop into Zo to eat. We got the pork gyro plate, chicken gyro, and a kale salad. The portions were generous. The pita was so soft, hot and delicious. The gyro plate came with crunchy potato wedges. My boyfriend loved them! The kale salad wasn't a normal boring salad. I loved the thinly sliced fennel, roasted sweet potatoes, and apple. It had a good balance of crunch and flavor. The waiter was really attentive and nice. I want to come back to try the zucchini fritters!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"These guys are great. Â A friendly welcome, great food, great prices and a good little bar. I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch recently and had not tried this new location. Â  It was nice and clean and the service was quick and friendly. For food, I got the Chicken Gyro and the Lamb Chili. Â  The Gyro was full of chicken, moist, the pita was fresh and all of the vegetables were very fresh and flavorful. Â  The lamb chili was the perfect amount of spice and full of meat. Â  Overall, the food was great and I will be back for lunch whenever I am in the area.",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"So delicious and wish I had a Zo brick and mortar near me because the truck just isn't as good. We went to check it out this past weekend before running some errands in Assembly. One thing to note is that during lunch it's mostly a take out spot. They do have seats and the restaurant itself is nice, but the bar and the bigger food menu isn't available until 3, which I wasn't aware of. We were starving so each got a gyro (pork for me and chicken for him), plus stuffed cabbage and tomato soup. Everything was wonderful and very reasonably priced. The stuffed cabbage came topped with a lemony sauce; they might have been my favorite part of the meal. So simple yet such comfort food. My pork gyro was glorious. Decadent yet didn't make me feel unhealthy eating it. Everything was so fresh. The portion was also huge! I couldn't finish my gyro! I definitely want to check it out again at night when we can hopefully sit at the bar and order more of their dinner offerings!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"4,"Authentic and quaint restaurant nestled in Assembly Row. Â  It is located on the newer side over near Fit Row. I got the chicken gyro and it was delish! I was missing feta and fries, some places do that and I love it. The portions were big and so was the flavor. It's a great spot for lunch and would definitely go again!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"The second I tried their chargrilled wings, I felt like I was transported back to my home town in Lebanon.

I'm definitely coming back.",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"2,"I came in here last week and while I did like the food I was really disappointed with the service. I ordered the chicken rice bowl and I asked them if I could add olives to the bowl which they said was fine. When I got to the register I was then informed it was $1 for the olives, I am fine paying more for adding ingredients that are really costly (eggs, avocado, meat, etc.) but paying $1 for 5 olives is outrageous, especially considering I was not told there was an up charge upfront.",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Absolutely delicious.

I want to eat here everyday!Ordered here again tonight, absolutely amazing!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,This is a great little spot. I love Greek food and this place hits a home run. The food is great and I mean all of it. They use the best ingredients especially the meat and vegetables. It's a very clean but simple place to dine. They have Greek wine on tap that is very good. The staff is also great and the owners care about what they put out. Â If you love lamb they probably make some of the best I have ever had. The salads are great and the gyros are perfect. It's good to see people putting out quality food with no fuss! If I could give it 10 stars I would!,Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"This place is dangerous! Located right next to my gym, I can just pop in. I ordered their Greek fries (sooooo good and large portions), and the vegetarian pita. The food was so fresh, I didn't wait very long for my to go order. The only problem you will have is deciding what to get. The manager wasn't very friendly but the guy who took my order made up for it. So i won't take away any stars!

Yes please!",Zo Greek,"355 Revolution Dr New Partner's Healthcare Bldg Somerville, MA 02145"5,"OUTSTANDING everything. Â Greek food is meant to be fresh, simple and delicious. Â Zo does this to perfection. Â We ordered 2 appetizers - tzatziki and octopus. Â The octopus was perfectly done and seasoned with just the right amount of olive oil, lemon and capers. Â The tzatziki was served with warm pita bread and also perfectly garlicky. Â For dinner we both had the classic pork gyro and it was so amazingly good.The cocktail menu is also very impressive. Â My date had a drink with masticha liqueur from Chios and although it was a bit sweet it was refreshing on a Â hot day. Â There's a selection of great local beers (Night Shift) as well as authentic Greek beers.The service was also good.

Since I was by myself I decided to sit at the bar.The staff was really nice and since I was sitting at the bar near the guys who were preparing the sushi I got many samples of sushi for free which I though was very cool.I has a drink that I do not recall the name but was really good.I had the Lobster rangoon that I LOVED and really recommend and two different types of rolls: Philadelphia and another one I don't remember the name but it had shrimp, avocado and cucumber.I really enjoyed my meal, their menu has many interesting options.

To my surprise, they were happy and able to seat a party of five in less than 10 minutes on a Friday evening! Our waitress, Diana, was so personable I wanted to friend request her! Haha. The price was pretty reasonable; the food came in about 10-15, was steaming hot, and DELICIOUS. I ordered a bowl of the assembly fried rice, and sampled their spicy beef udon and edamame. I also had a Shirley temple and was sooo happy! Overall, a great experience, and one I wouldn't mind repeating in the near future.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,Early dinner while shopping and exploring the Assembly Row center. Fuji was not very busy on this evening and so I was immediately seated at one of the tables along the wall. Awesome that there was a power outlet there as well so I could recharge my phone!Service was friendly and helpful. The young lady has clearly been practicing her sincere smile.I had a good chirashi for dinner. Not a huge portion but the sushi was fresh and tasty. I'd have this again but definitely would supplement with something else.,Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"If you're in Assembly Row, stopping by Fuji for a bite to eat is not to be missed! This delicious Japanese sushi bar is spacious with generous table and bar space. My favorite spot is at the bar. Here you can find my favorite welcoming waiter, Ray, who is sure to make your experience fun and memorable! Everything I've sampled has been fresh and delicious. I'd hands down recommend getting a bento box. The salmon teriyaki bento box is my favorite! The portion is generous, and you get a great selection of options from their menu. I found that it was a great way to sample items to pick what you want to eat the next time. All their rolls are made fresh, and the sushi is created perfectly. Don't forget to request some sake to sip on as you eat your meal.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"My husband and I enjoyed our dinner here on a Monday night. It was a quiet night and although we made reservations, we could have picked where to sit because there were maybe 3 other small parties of people there. I ordered an udon soup that came with tempura. It was really delicious and comforting especially on the cold evening (mind you, I live in Hawaii). I was surprised how filling and big the portion was considering it was one of the cheapest things on the menu. The soup had vegetables (yummy mushrooms) and the plate of tempura had shrimp and various vegetables. I walked out as a content customer and felt warm!My husband got a tuna sashimi dish which was also good. He ordered a unique sauce with French onions and spicy mayo to go for it. It was ok and not typical of Japanese dishes. The bowl was small but filling combined with all the tempura in my dish.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"I'm a fan of the Fuji location in Quincy so I was pleasantly surprised to find the same menu here.The staff was great and the hostess moved two tables together to give me a place for my baby stroller.I had the seared special lunch - a delicious treat of a meal!The waitstaff was great, letting me take my time to finish. (I had my 6 month old with me & she wanted to sit with Mom - which slows my ability to eat.)I'll definitely be back when I'm at Assembly Row again.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,My family and I ordered dinner from this restaurant:We ordered:* salmon sashimi* seared salmon sushi* spicy salmon roll* caterpillar roll* stir fry beef udon* sunset maki* pan fried dumplings* lobster rangoons* spicy chicken slivers* assembly fried riceThe sushi and sashimi was fresh. I liked the spicy salmon and seared salmon sushi. The stir fried beef udon was good as well.,Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"This place is clean and modern looking. The price is your typical high end sushi place. Although it's odd. It's a fusion of Japanese and Chinese. The hokkai yaki was yummy but it doesn't look appetizing. However, don't judge a book by its cover. It was spicy and soft and salty and just yummy. It looks more like a spicy pancake/crepe than scallops but its good. The toro nigiri was fantastic. It was fatty and i love the presentation to include gold flakes. The seared maguro was yummy as well. Bruins roll was delicious. I'd order that again in a heartbeat.Def willing to come back and try the chinese food dishes. The menu looked Â delish as well.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"We love coming here for sushi! Every sushi place I have been to gets your food out quickly, but this place is the quickest! The spicy tuna and space salmon rolls are our favorite! They have really perfected those rolls Â the only comment I can make about why I didn't give them 5/5 stars is that their rolls are small in size when comparing to other sushi places.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"I came here here on a Tuesday evening and was seated immediately. Our server was friendly but she was not very attentive, we had to ask her to refill water and tea. FYI, the hot tea is not free like in some restaurants, it costs 1.50 per cup! The husband and I decided to share 3 sushi rolls between us, so we ordered: Rowing down the mystic - get this if you like salmon! The spicy mayo taste is quite strong, you might not like this if you don't like mayo.Dragon - this is pretty common in sushi restaurant. Fried tempura with avocado and eel. Can't go wrong with this! Note that this comes in 4 giant pieces instead of 6 or 8 like other rolls Spicy scallop - this was hands down my favorite roll. The fried scallop and tobiko on top of the rolls gave it a nice crunch and texture compared to the other rolls. When you first put it into your mouth you will first taste the spicy mayo on the top, and when you bite into it you can taste the sweetness of the eel sauce inside. Overall the sushi was pretty good Americanized sushi. It might be my ordering choice, but they all seemed quite heavy on the mayo, it was definitely a very rich meal.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"I love this place! The sushi is always fresh and made to order, and the decor inside just adds to the experience.Their sweet crispy chili wings are so good! Perfectly crispy with a delicious sweet chili glaze. I only wish they had an option for this as an entree so that I could order more as a meal!I also ordered the lobster Rangoon. I really like their take on this because it's not too overpowered by the filling and it's not too oily like some other rangoons that other establishments make.The scorpion maki was surprisingly very good! I don't normally go for sushi with eel but all the flavors worked well together.The staff here is very nice, and actually engage in conversation with people, which is always a plus. (Especially when you wander in alone after running errands) I will be back !They didn't have duck sauce when I was there, but the bartender made due by offering me some of their other sauces. I didn't know they made theirs fresh, so bonus points for that!",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"1,I ordered the rib eye teriyaki to go. Medium well. But when I open the box the beef is red! I couldn't eat it. It was different than when I eat in store. And waste $28!,Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"We came here for a bite to eat after shopping, looking for good food but something softer on the wallet. Fuji was the perfect place for this!The atmosphere took me by surprise - it's pleasantly spacious with a beautiful open sushi counter and high ceilings. We started off with a complimentary chef's tasting, which was a torched salmon nigiri with eel sauce -- delicious. For appetizer, we had the salmon with wonton crisps. I loved this modern take on nachos! Highly recommend this dish. We had the Sushi deluxe combo rolls, with the scorpion roll and rainbow rolls being my favorite. They have a nice proportion of fish to rice and everything is so fresh that it melts in your mouth. Would definitely return again!!",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"3,"Currently the best choice for food in the Assembly Row area IMO. Fancy Asian fusion cuisine isn't my thing but this place is convenient when heading over to AMC for a movie. Took 5-10 min to get seated even tho the restaurant had plenty of seating; front desk wasn't super efficient but it's passable. The food here is consistent and not bad quality--I've had the hot & sour soup and salmon bowl. Both were good but nothing outstanding. The presentation was great but the soup was lacking any sour flavor. The salmon was fresh and the sushi rice on spot on tho. However, I still definitely prefer All Seasons to this place in terms of quality and flavor, especially when they are similar in terms of pricing. All in all, you'll have a good meal here if you're at Assembly, but I wouldn't come here if I weren't already in the area.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Our family was basically floored with amazing consideration and service today at Fuji. Â It was 10 of us, and when first group arrived, we weren't thrilled with the positioning of the table for the group. Â We asked the manager for a possibility of creating a more intimate atmosphere with repositioning the table (and, hence, the whole party area), and the manager,Sabrina, went above and beyond with accommodating our suggestions. Â Nowadays we are so used to the Â lack of flexibility in restaurants, this was an amazing surprise. Â  It allowed our BD celebration to really flourish the way we hoped it would, with restaurant team on board. Â The service - Ariel - was also amazing, and food, of course, has been its usual perfect. Â So our greatest thanks and much appreciation for open-mindedness and true welcoming its patrons. Â  Sabrina, Ariel, Fuji - you have made this BD really special",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"3,"Came here one night with a friend. Maybe it was that particular night but it felt empty. The setup gave me teriyaki House (restaurant on boylston) vibes which I didn't care for. The food here is good, I ordered the gyoza and sake teriyaki salmon.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"Came here at 1 pm on a Sunday, this place is not that crowded, there's a wave of people coming in and out all the time. The waitress is really nice, quiet attentive to my table except she overlooks the tea sometimes and we have to keep asking for a refill. Over all, the service is satisfactory. They give really good recommendations for the menu. As for the food, we ordered 3 things. One thing to note is that the fish is ""very fresh"". I would say that it's worth the price (yeah, it's quiet pricy). There are a few good lunch menu selections if you are interested. 1) seaweed salad: although it is 6 dollars, they give a generous amount. We could barely finish it (2 of us). It comes with the yellow radish on top, too. But if you ask if there's anything special, not really. (7/10) 2) chirashi: came with 12 pieces of sashimi (toro, salmon, hamachi, and one fish I have no idea what it is.. gonna assume it's white tuna). The fish is really fresh, really satisfied with this. However, the rice is quiet sour, too much vinegar for me. The quality of the Japanese rice is great though, only improvement would be less vinegar. I'm a huge rice person... so the rice makes a big difference .(8/10)3) mings mango maki: this mango maki is reaaally good. I was craving for some good mango maki and this hit the point. Although I would prefer oishii's mango maki over this because it's not as spicy, this satisfied my cravings. It came with toro on top with some spicy sauce, the inside was filled with cucumber and mango. It's a good mixture of ingredients, ide suggest anyone to try this. (9/10) Over all it was a great experience. The ambience is alright, the music playing were old school party songs like aviicii's song and diamonds by Rihanna, I find it a bit too loud. The song didn't really suit the restaurant. Anyway - if you drop by assembly square for some shopping, drop by.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"5,Their calamari is SO GOOD. Â Make sure you start out with this! Â We also tried the watermelon drink that comes inside a watermelon and I can't wait to come back and have it again. Â So delicious!My friend and I ordered sushi which was all phenomenal. Â I also tried their dumplings - they were just okay and I would stick with the sushi next time.,Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"Busy restaurant! We had sushi boat and some appetisers. Good food good service. Go to neighbourhood restaurant. Â Other than Japanese food, the menu has a lot of Chinese food as well. Therefore, it is NOT an authentic Japanese restaurant, its more like an Asian restaurant.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"3,"Good but over priced. Went for dinner and we went early so there wasn't a wait. We ordered the Chirashi, spicy salmon maki roll, dynamite maki roll and miso soup. The miso soup was good but very salty. The Chirashi was good but rice was not. The two rolls were good but the dynamite maki is way overpriced ($16). I was surprised to not see any real sushi handrolls on the menu, all they had were vegetarian options for handrolls which were also quite pricey for rice, seaweed, and your choice of avocado and cucumber like ingredients. The food itself is good, there isn't too much rice on the rolls and it is a good balance of fish to rice. The restaurant itself was open and clean with a good dining ambiance. Customer service was fine, nothing terrible or exceptional. Overall, I don't think it's worth the $.",Fuji at Assembly,"320 Canal St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"This is definitely one of my all time favorite Thai places! I've been here quite a few times and the food is always excellent. It's a pretty casual place with really great prices and a wide selection of options for all your Thai food needs and cravings.The food - there are three dishes which I think are definitely the highlights. The Tom yum fried rice is extremely tasty. It's definitely a little spicy but nothing crazy and all the flavors of the Tom yum really come through. The pad see ew is another incredible dish - it's not too sweet and every noodle has flavor! I recommend getting it with tofu as the tofu soaks up even more of the sauce and flavor. Last but definitely not least in the highlights is he massamam curry. I wish it came with a bit more sauce and it were a bit more thick but all the flavors are there and the veggies are really well cooked. If you want some appetizers I love their scallion pancakes. The Thai iced tea is also good, a bit too sweet but definitely not the sweetest I've had. Their sticky rice mango is also the best I've had in the area with the mango being perfectly ripe and the coconut really coming through in the rice. The place is really small and the only times there really haven't been people is during a weekday in the mid afternoon. Take out is also a great option for this place and it usually doesn't take long at all. You can order take out through their website, call, through ubereats and probably some other delivery companies. The people are really nice, very attentive, and the service Â is pretty quick. A really must have for Thai food in the area!!",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"TBH, I could not eat at Thai restaurants in Boston after returning from my Thailand trip. However, this is one of the better Thai eateries in the Boston area. Obviously it isn't as delicious as the food I had during my trip, but here, at least the flavors remind me of Thailand, which is more than what I can say about other Thai restaurants. Crispy pork rice plate is very good, and he swears by the Boat Noodle Soup. For takeout, I would avoid the flat noodles because they tend to overcook and fall apart. Papaya salad very spicy, like I had in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. It's mostly a takeout place but there are a few tables. Considering how tiny this place is, the menu is extensive and there's something for everyone. The prices are very reasonable. If you order online, there's a discount! Plus they package your order very carefully, with cardboard in between each container so the plastic/aluminum doesn't squish.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"2,"Was excited to try after reading rave reviews, but the food was hugely disappointing. I ordered Beef Pad Thai and did so because it's hard to mess up Pad Thai. Â It was very bland, too sweet, and flavorless... there was also no charred color from the wok on the noodles. Â The only plus sides are huge portions and cheap price... but I'd think Davis Square has much better options. Â It's a tiny place, 3-4 tables.. I think most people order takeout.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,Very good Thai food. Tried two of the chef specials- garlic rice and chicken was delicious- gingery and with a tangy spicy sauce. The other dish was a combination of Chinese sausage and two other pork based meats with a tangy sweet red sauce. Both were super good.,Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Exactly what we need more of in the Boston area. It's not fancy and it might not be the best ever, but it is simple, affordable, and unique. Â For such a small place the menu is surprisingly extensive. Their most interesting dishes though are probably their rice plates that come with a protein, Chinese sausage, and a fried egg. Their signature dish Khao Na Kai Â was satisfying and had a very comforting homemade taste. The Kor Tor Mor noodle Soup with clear broth, roast pork, fish balls, and wonton was also simple comfort food. The place is small. It only has 3 tables so I suspect that take-out will be a popular option. Great for lunch or a quick weekday dinner.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Kor tor mor is the best thai food i have had in boston. There are always people here no matter the time of day and I totally understand it. I would live in this place if I could. The papaya salad is so good- fresh, spicy, tangy. I also recommend the pad kua kai - the noodles are perfectly cooked and spiced, the chicken and squid cooked tender (drizzle a little bit of the leftover sauce from the papaya salad and it is to die for). I recommend coming with friends and sharing so you cab try everything. Be adventurous - go beyond the classic pad thai or drunken noodles and you will not regret.The service is great here- wait staff are super fast and so is take out if you would rather bring home. It looks very small - but even if it is full they move people along fast. The prices are very reasonable and lunch prices are unbelievable! You can't go wrong!!",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Let me begin by saying that I have never been to Thailand before and, by default, have never had street food in Thailand before. Â I have not experienced the terrior of Bangkok at night, and have never taken advantage of the Baht to USD conversion rates. Â From this viewpoint, I think they do some rock solid food here. In a city like Somerville, it feels as if every square needs to have a solid Thai food option. Â When i went to school in Davis, CA, there were 6 Thai restaurants within one square mile! Â Having said that, this place has the usual dishes, but it also has dishes I have never seen or heard of before. Â The one plate I had, what could amount to a rice plate with pork three ways, roasted, fried, and in sausage form, was amazingly good. It was coated with a red sauce, not too sweet and not too sour, but just enough of both to compliment the dish.Their Thai Iced Tea is on point, the fried tofu with the peanut sauce was good, and their tom yum hit the spot. The price point is reasonable, and their dining space was clean and well-lit. Â They only have four tables so dining in could be an issue with larger groups. Â They also have a pretty robust take-out game going on which it seemed lots of people were taking advantage of. Â Last but note least, the customer service was five stars. Â I found the Thai Iced Tea I had to be a little too sweet, they adjusted it for me without question. Â Stuff like that goes a long way and, from my end, elevates this an amazing little spot that I hope I will be able to visit again in the near future.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"We had few friends coming over so we ordered to take out, and that's what you should do because only few small tables in the restaurant. Prices were very affordable and in the range, the staff was friendly and helpful. Everyone really enjoyed the food and the quality was very good. The crispy belly pork in the Drunkin noodles was the big hit of the night and the spices were very well equilibrated! Those that we wanted them very spicy were perfectly dosed.I am really happy to have finally in Davis sq a good Thai restaurant!",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"2,"I was excited to try another Thai place in the area.I went off of the street food section because that seems to be the raison d'etre for the name. I got the Kana Moo Grob -- pork belly stir-friend with Chinese broccoli. The pork belly is shared with another dish -- Kapow Moo Grob. Perhaps because of that, the meat was pre- and over-cooked, and when stir-fried again, it came out really tough. I don't mind my pork belly dry, but I had trouble chewing through it to finish the meal.They closed a bit early. When we left, the employees were eating before cleaning up. I swear one of their bowls had some fresher pieces of pork belly. They must have seen me staring longingly on their security cam, as they called out from the back room when no one was in the front of the house.I want this place to succeed, but it's gonna need more fresh cooking.I see another negative review for pork belly, so maybe they need to focus on it, as it makes up 14% of the street food section of their menu.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,Takeout pad Thai with amazing pad Thai noodles and huge serving yum!! So fast and good,Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"2,"Ambiance: very clean and contemporary. Definitely looks like a place you would want to try, but mainly as a takeout spot.Service: average, they ran out of the item ordered online and informed me only during pick-up.Food: HUGE disappointment. I ordered very generic dishes to try it out. Pad Thai - lacks flavor, noodles seemed overcooked, chicken was dry, overall it felt like something was missing from the dish. Fried Rice with pork belly - fried rice with fried pork belly on top (clarification, didn't specify on the menu), also very bland. The pork belly was tough and the fried batter tasted very soggy. Crab Rangoon - average chain restaurant taste with bad oil all around. If you are in need of something quick to eat, this might do. Overall, I would not recommend spending your money on their food.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I've never been to Thailand so I can't tell if this place is 100% authentic street food. But this place is definitely not your average neighborhood oily Thai place that does delivery!! Ordered signature chicken& sausage dish (B1) and Chicken flat noodle (B9).

Will come back to try more dishes!",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,I loved this place so much.

I can't wait to go back for more!,Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"An awesome addition to the neighborhood. There are some interesting things that are off the beaten path a little. Some highlights:1. Moo Ping - this delicious marinaded pork with an awesome sauce and sticky rice. An app, but could be a main too.2. Moo Grob fried rice - highlight! Was there shrimp paste or something similar to that in there? It was super fragrant and delicious.3. Khao na ped - awesome, really tender duck with a yummy sauce. Definitely share it if you want a variety - i probably wouldn't have ordered this as my only dish. 4. scallion pancake - we got this with the coupon. Pleasantly surprised, the dough was flakier than many other places which i love. And served with a nice sweet ginger-y sauce.Lows:1. the pad thai with crispy chicken. Blah, too sweet, not balanced enough. Rod dee's pad thai is a lot better, and they fry their chicken on the crispier side too. This was really the only down dish.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,I went with a friend and we had a Khao Na Kai for our entree and chicken satay for appetizers.

This restaurant along with Pepper Sky in Central Square are my favorite Thai restaurants in the area.,Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"3,"3.5 starsI was very excited about Kor Tor Mor after I read an article about its opening on Eater. I recently returned from a trip to Thailand and I was craving Thai food. We stopped in around 6PM on opening night and ordered 2 dishes, B1 khao na kai and B3 khao mu dang, and Thai iced tea. The good: The food tasted very fresh and the presentation was nice. I would consider this the lighter version of Thai food as it was not as greasy as other places I've been to. The restaurant is very clean and cozy and the owner is nice. The improvement opportunities:The food lacked flavor. I don't know if it was the dishes that I ordered but I felt like they were missing something. The B1 was a chicken and rice dish with a fried egg. The egg was cooked perfectly with no traces of oil. However, it just tasted like a normal sauteed chicken with rice dish. The B3 was a rice plate with 3 types of meat. Again it was lackluster and not memorable. Â Next time I would rather visit one of the many other Thai options in Boston.",Kor Tor Mor,"24 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"It's great to have a good Thai restaurant in Davis Square! We had papaya salad, duck noodles and ster-fried crispy pork belly with string beans, all 3 dishes are pretty good.

All of what I've had there is a decent version of what it is supposed to be.They have a great beer selection, and their fried foods are quite good. The highlights there are the fried okra (it's fresh okra), and fried pickles. To be specific, fried pickle slices. This is not gross, watery fried pickle spears.I tend to haunt the downstairs area, as it is usually feasible to grab a couple of bar seats.

The food was dry... beyond dry. The ribs were a spice rubbed rib so I could understand it being a bit dry but it wasn't exactly tender either. The meat wasn't fall off the bone and using the bbq sauces they provide didn't help as much as I hoped. The sauce added some flavor but it did not help with the dryness. The brisket was terrible. IT WAS TERRIBLY DRY... and soooooooooooo hard to eat. No amount of bbq sauce they provide would have helped.I really wish it was a better experience food wise but it is what it is.

Great. Second experience: I got the side 1/4 of the brisket. It came with a biscuit. Excellent. I got a side of collards. Always great. Then I got an appetizer of the fried JalapeÃ±os and Pickles.

My friend who had their baby back ribs also said he'd recommend them.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"I've been coming to Redbones with my family since I was little, and had another excellent meal there tonight! I always have to start with the delicious corn fritters, which are served in a pool of yummy Vermont maple syrup. Tonight I had the catfish dinner, which is pretty unique to a Redbones. They marinate the catfish in a pepper sauce, then deep fry it in a crunchy cornmeal crust. The fish is very clean tasting and has a nice kick from the pepper marinade. You get your choice of 2 sides from an extensive list; I chose cornbread and hand-cut fries. The catfish also came with hushpuppies, which were very tasty. The draught beer selection is extensive, as is the cocktail and margarita menu. Try the ""Redbones Shandy,"" a homemade blend of Allagash White, elderflower liqueur, and fresh lemonade. Redbones has a great, fun environment, and the servers are always cool, interesting people. It's a Somerville institution and shouldn't be missed!",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Finally made my rounds at this place. My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon. This place is so authentic and really felt like a good BBQ joint. This place has been running for 30 years and I love all the vintage images posted around. There are 3 portions of this restaurant. There's the dining area, the bar area, and the downstairs lounge area. They also have nights where they play blues music on certain nights.My friend and I shared the Barbecue Belt and the Fried Chicken Dinner. The Barbecue Belt consists of: 2 St. Louis ribs, 1 Texas style ribs, 2 baby back ribs, beef brisket, and 1 sausage. My favorite from the belt was the St. Louis ribs because it didn't even need sauce. With the Barbecue Belt came with 2 sides and we got collard greens and mac and cheese. Both sides were great. Fried Chicken Dinner came with 2 pieces of fried chicken, boneless, mashed potatoes, fried okra, 2 biscuits, butter and peach jam. Everything on this plate was absolutely amazing. We also got their beignets. It comes fresh in a white paper bag with 4 small ones and it is SO GOOD.The service was very good and the food came out reaaaallly quick.

My husband and I went on a Saturday night at 5:00. Plenty of seating at that time. Service was really quick. I got the jalapeÃ±o margarita (so good - super hot and spicy). My husband loved the beer selection and he ordered the sip of sunshine. We both got pulled pork sandwiches - large portions, super moist pork, great sweet bbq sauce. I ordered the onion rings as one of my sides - best onion rings I've ever had. Fried to perfection. We also loved the bbq baked beans. For two people our meal including tip came to just over $60. Well worth it. Definitely going back! The one thing I'd change is the coleslaw that came on the side with the sandwich. I prefer a more vinegary slaw but besides that small detail everything was perfect.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"This is a review of my last experience there this weekend with a large group of 8. Â While the food is fine, probably 3 stars - nothing to go nuts over, but good - the service, considering our large group size and it being a busy Saturday night, was great. Â We made a reservation for 7:15, and despite the place being packed, we were actually sat only about 10/15 min. later which was a pleasant surprise (lots of restaurants would botch this!). They have 2 bars to wait at too, but we were honestly too big to be able to really bother. Â  The waitress was patient and attentive too.I thought their $13 dinner special as really reasonable as well - 1 main & 2 hefty sides - and plenty of food!

Of course the Boston area isn't know for its BBQ, but Redbones will prove the stereotypes wrong! The ambiance is VERY casual, and almost too divey in my opinion. It's definitely got a family feel (loud and energetic) with some eclectic decorations and checkered tablecloths, but I think it could use a facelift. Great beer menu to go with your BBQ!! We got the smoked beef brisket sandwich and it was AMAZING!! The meat was so tender and it came with two sides- I recommend both the mac & cheese and the onion rings! They didn't have that many sauces to pick from which really didn't appeal to me as I feel like the BBQ sauce options make all the difference (especially when compared to Sheds BBQ in downtown boston). Overall, definitely recommend as a Davis Square must-visit!",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Fantastic draught list! In addition to beers, lots of great local ciders on tap.

My husband ordered the pulled pork dinner with dirty rice and baked beans. Everything was on point.I ordered the smoked sausage with cornbread and french fries. The sausage was super spicy. I'm personally a fan of everything spicy, but if you're not expecting it, it might be a surprise for something. Overall delicious. The french fries were nothing special and the weakest link out of everything, but the cornbread was out of this world.The ambiance is very casual. The service was friendly, but not necessarily a focus. If you're not a high maintenance person who likes to enjoy yummy barbecue comfort food in a casual environment, then this is the place for you.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"The meat was on the dry/burnt side but I like it that way. The sides were touch and go. Biscuits were hard and unremarkable but the peach jam was tastey. Dirty rice was also dry, but had a good flavor. Greens and fried okra were pretty standard. Service was great. Bottom line, this is probably the best barbecue I would expect from Boston.",Redbones BBQ,"55 Chester St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I hadn't been to Redbones in a long time.

Â Sat at the bar.I have to say it was one of the better meals I have had there. Â The cole slaw was really fresh. Â The baked beans were good, not great. Â The generous helping of pork was much appreciated, and I ate it with an assortment of sauces.The key with this place is to go with an open mind. Â It's pretty divey, but in a really good way. Â Lots of great art and decorations. Â It even has one of Tyler Hamilton's jerseys from when he was on Team CSC. Â So if you're a cyclist, you'll get a dose of cycling memorabilia.I think they do beef brisket very well. Â And the pulled chicken is excellent. Â Can't remember about the ribs.

For over three years, I have been trying to get here in time for the burger. I failed four times. I finally did it tonight, and I'm so proud of myself. :). The burger is rated on almost everyone's list as one of the best burgers in America, and I will have to say that it did not disappoint. Yet, you need to be there by 6 or 6:30 most nights to enjoy it because there is a limited supply, and the restaurant is situated in the middle of Harvard Square where many students and locals flood in early in the evening for drinks and the famous burger.The burger is traditional in many respects: a solid large bun, a substantial amount of charcoal grilled beef, lettuce, tomato, special sauce, and a cheese chip (you know those cheese chips from Whole Foods? yea ...that delicious thing). The burger meat was so juicy, and the taste exactly as I like it. I do not like a lot of extra condiments or toppings on my burgers, so I appreciated that this burger was unique, large and yet traditional. The burger is accompanied with homemade chips.The cocktail list is one of my favorite in the area, and the fact that I arrived at 6:00 pm and left at 10:00 pm may attest to it. My favorite was the Holy Mole mezcal cocktail, but all of the ones I tried were delicious (no disclosure on how many). The service at the bar was attentive and friendly all evening in a perfect kind of way. I'm glad I finally made it to Alder and Harlowe!",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"Located right off Harvard Square. I came for the secret burger and some cocktails. Good: the cocktails were very well balanced and fairly priced. Atmosphere was nice, a bit dark, but it fit the bill for the underground gastropub/bar.Average: the burger, in every way. For something that is secret and ultra hyped, I had high expectations. This burger, and its overdone patty and mound of shredded ice berg, was just ok. It wasn't awful by any means but it tasted like Anytown USA bar burger. Bad: the bartender had an attitude. That was annoying but almost felt expected. If you're hoping for the secret burger to wow you, you'll need to be someone who gets off on posting photos of you getting the burger and showing off...rather than the taste itself.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"The ~Secret Burger had been on the top of my food priority list. I even made sure to get an early reservation because I heard they had limited availability. Well, I got the burger.... and it was just fine. My boyfriend and I both agreed that it was way more hyped up than it should have been. Don't get me wrong- it was good, but it didn't blow me away at all. My cocktail was also like two sips worth of liquid :/ Otherwise, it was a nice environment- one of those typical restaurants where it's a little too dark. They gave us some complimentary pickles, which were quite tasty. I think I would come here again and give it another chance since it does get such high praise- I just wouldn't order the same food or drink.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"The main reason I set foot in Alden was to try their Secret Burger, which has been touted as one of the best burgers in the city. Being the burger aficionado that I am, I was quite disappointed after being seated when I was told they had run out of burgers for the day. I could've just walked out then and there, but I decided to stay and see what else was on the menu.It was the smartest decision I made that day.The food is served in a Tapas style, meant to be shared among friends at the table. There's a wide variety of options for several palettes. Being the carnivore that I am, I made it a priority to try the NY strip steak, and was simply blown away by the incredible amount of flavour in the beef. Other staple items, such as the chicken thigh and latkes were out of this world. And in the event you don't have a massive appetite, the snacks provide a great amount of value and taste. My personal favourites were the Chips and Three Onion Dip and Patatas Bravas. If you get the chance to try their Secret Burger, you should probably go for it. But even if it's unavailable, this restaurant has some of the best tasting Tapas-style food I've had in a very long time, and alongside a stopover at Mike's Pastry, is reason alone to go to Harvard Square.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"4,"I feel like the dishes definitely used fresh ingredients and tried to showcase them in natural, more mild flavors that let you taste the ingredients for what they were. But there were a couple dishes where I think they pulled too many flavor punches and could've been more bold with their seasoning and profiles. I'll list the dishes from most to least-liked:Braised Featherbrook RabbitCrispy Berkshire Pork BellyStuffed MorelsLentil HummusChicken Thigh TorchonSourdough with House Cultured Butter and Za'atarBeet FarfalleThe biggest reason we came was to try their Secret Burger, but to our big disappointment, they ran out by 8:30. So seems like they weren't joking around about their ""limited availability.""So I feel like I'm giving the 4-star rating with the assumption that their burger was going to be good.

More like 3.5 stars at most. :)",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"Update: They were super accommodating about my onion/garlic intolerance and tried their best to make every dish we ordered allergen-free. However, the food is still subpar. A lot of the flavor combinations were confusing and really didn't work, like the puffed millet on the glazed carrots, or the kumquat sauce with the pork belly. It feels like they tried to be inventive but instead made the dishes worse. My companions also complained the the bread on the mussels was burnt and the mussels had too much parsley. Again, would never come here unless suggested by someone else / didn't have to pay for it myself.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"The atmosphere is super cute and the place is much larger than the outside appears. We came for just a drink with friends and sat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and quick to take our orders and make our drinks. We ordered espresso martini's but they didn't have an espresso machine, but had a coffee liquor made in house. The drinks were average but not something that would bring me back there for just drinks. If I go back it will be to try the food",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"2,"So what is yelp protocol for a place that has good food, but rude and slow service? That's the conundrum I'm stuck in... you decide:We had reservations with our friends well in advance, and started off rocky when they tried to sit us as at a high table (am I the only one who isn't comfortable when my knees have to be at 45 degrees in order to rest my feet on something?).From there, it took about 10 min to get our drink order in... after it was made somewhere at least 10 miles away... we got our drinks about 25 minutes into the sitting. This would've been overlooked had we not faced problems for the rest of dinner.We had to remind our server on a couple of occasions of items we never received, which she responded by slamming the second plate and spilling the items around the table. At that point it was as awkward as a Trump-Clinton Thanksgiving dinner, so I asked the manager for a change in service.In the end, they comped us a few items and the food was terrific. So it's really upon the reader to judge what kind of experience we had. Would we go back again? Maybe in a year or so to avoid that server.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"Great food, hip atmosphere and really good cocktails. Sat at the chefs counter which help in choosing the dishes.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"4 stars for food and 2 stars for service. Food is tapas style and a very eclectic mix of flavor profiles, which I enjoyed. We had the corn pancakes, which is super interesting if you like the salty and sweet combo. The brussel sprouts are delicious! We also had the green garlic pasta, which was good but not too special. The chicken thigh is a smaller dish but very good!Service was below average. Staff acts somewhat posh and isn't very friendly.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"I'm sorry to say that I don't understand the hype about this restaurant. While the service and atmosphere were excellent, the food just didn't blow me out of the water.We started with the Smoked Trout Toast, which was considered a snack. This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. It had the perfect touch of smokey flavor without being bitter. We also got:*Stuffed Morels- eh. Weird texture and flavors just mush together.*Charred Broccoli- The broccoli was good. The butternut squash was a little too sweet. But $13 for decent broccoli? No.*Crispy Pork Belly- I LOVE pork belly, but the skin on this pork was SO overdone that it was like eating toffee. If you tried to chew it, everything got stuck in your teeth like a caramel. The grits and bits on the plate were pretty tasty though. *Sweet Pea Tortellini- I actually really enjoyed this dish, but my husband was so disappointed this was how we ended the meal. He said it tasted like they took peas, chopped them up and just stuck them in pasta. No sauce, no seasoning, no thing extra. I like peas so I guess this works for me?!Overall, nothing made us want to return. For as much money as we spent ($115 before tip) we would prefer to hop over to their sister restaurant, Waypoint, and have an amazing meal.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"My best friend and I had a lovely time at this restaurant! It had the best vibes, and is conveniently located in downtown Harvard Square. The highlight for me was...everything! We ordered the kale salad, burratta, chicken, raviolis to share (they recommend sharing 3-4 dishes). Then, we ended with an AMAZING honey soaked apricot dessert with spoon cake and whipped cream.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"4,"We all have them: our culinary conquests. You know what I'm talking about....Before I die I have to try this or have to eat there. For me, one item has continually slipped my grasps. I have long heard tales of this burger only being offered in limited quantities and selling out in record times. I've read about it in blogs and lists that has consistently placed it among the best burgers in the country. After years of failure, I have reached the mountain top. Even if that meant eating a burger for breakfast in an attempt to capture the first one out of the kitchen. That's dedication! I stand before you a champion of the Alden and Harlow secret burger! Super hero aside, the burger is good, not great. The beef is juicy and the Parmesan crisp offers a nice texture balance. Not a huge fan of the sauce or the bun. Strangely enough, I found the homemade chips to be stellar, even more so than the burger itself. Overall I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a good burger, but pretty sure if there wasn't all the hype surrounding it, I would have enjoyed it a little more.Now, what to do with this cape.....",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"Wow! Â Came by here - almost missed it, slightly hard to find.Came here for brunch / breakfast. Food: innovative, fun, delicious. Â Great service as well!Fantastic design and ambience. Â The buildout of the space is really interesting while remaining warm and inviting. Â  The space is huge, and it's all put to good use. Â Would love to come back for dinner.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"ZOMG. Â Alden & Harlow. Â Life-Changing. Â You must come here for this experience! Â I came here for a late-night dinner date.RESTAURANT: Vibes were hella cute. Â Place had a great ambiance, dimly-lit, exposed brick; all the trimmings of yuppie foodie culture! Â One of the art pieces on the wall said, ""The People's Drug"", which I thought was appropriate because the food was so DARN GOOD.SERVICE: The service was impeccable and attentive like restaurants like these usually are. Â But what struck me and my date the most was their timing -- aka PERFECT! Â They give you the exact time you need for each dish. Â The next dish doesn't come too soon, and either get cold sitting on your table, or force you to wolf down your meal (or come too late and leave you feeling sad and hungry.) Â Great job, A&H.DRINKS: We ordered 1) Suit and Thai ($14), 2) Duckhunter ($13), and later on 3) Rum through the Jungle ($12). Â All really good. Â Duckhunter stood out with its strong foie gras flavor -- really interesting in a whiskey drink.FOOD: We ordered two small plates and three large plates.The small plates: 1) the Burrata ($8), and 2) the Chicken Liver Toast ($8). Â #1: The Burrata was pretty standard. Â Not bad, but nothing worth raving about. #2: The Chicken Liver Toast may as well have changed my life. Â THE FLAVORS. Â THE TEXTURES. Â I don't think it's on the menu anymore (idk why?), but this toast both melted in your mouth yet had bite. Â It was sprinkled with some blueberries and nuts, so refreshing and tempering (respectively) in a rich dish! Â We were literally groaning after every bite -- probs made a few people uncomfortable. Â But I digress.The large plates: 1) Wellfleet Countneck Clams ($16), 2) Anson Mills Hush Puppies ($15), and 3) Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly ($16). Â Each deserve their own paragraph of worship.#1: The Countneck Clams were SO good. Â Not only were they stuffed with flavor from the tangy, refreshing parsley sauce, but the freaking PIG'S TAIL. Â My date and I were joking that we were having quite the strange dinner with chicken liver and now pig's tail, but I will now leap to order pig's tail whenever I see it on the menu, because it is like bacon but SO MUCH better. Â Just all this ~flavor~ saturated into a tiny piece of meat. Â Spreading that meat and parsley on the little slices of toast was just DIVINE. #2: The Hush Puppies at first bite felt too salty too me; the bacon was overpowering. Â But upon eating my second bite with a bit of the rhubarb jam that was dolloped elsewhere on the plate, I understood the thought behind the dish. Â The meat was definitely still salty, but not at all in an unbearable way -- it became more like having something really umami. Â The sweetness of the rhubarb jam made it an intriguing combo.#3: The Pork Belly was SO fat and crispy, how I think every pork belly should be. Â It was so darn rich, it felt almost sinful, but I didn't care because it's melt-in-your-mouth goodness made it worth every bite. Â By this time, my date and I were both so full, but the pork belly was so good we ate ourselves into oblivion.IN SUM: Please go to Alden & Harlow for dinner! Â I think most of the reviews on Yelp talk about it for brunch (which I scouted out when I made my first reservation and will sure try out eventually), but I think the creativity and intention behind the dishes they serve at dinner are also deserving of attention. Â Eat here and treat yo'self!",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"OhMyGoodness! So so so very good. Don't sit at the chefs/kitchen table unless you either can resist temptation or you've come packing a bottomless pit.

We had to endure listening to two females talking about their love life or lack their of.

The other two times mirrored this last visit. Do make a reservation. Is possible they can seat with without, but on busy nights forget it. The cocktails are inventive and hand crafted. I've tried most of them and all were delicious. Your server will help you choose too. Being vegan is tough when eating out, but not here. The chef will modify a lot of many items, so don't be afraid to ask. We ordered everything veggie on the menu and it was spectacular. Beautiful use of fresh ingredients. Cannot wait to come back.",Alden & Harlow,"40 Brattle St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"We came here for a bread baking class, and it was awesome! It was small - only 6 of us - and we got individual attention. The owner is so passionate and talked about his family back in Italy. We learned a ton about bread, he printed out a bunch of guides to making different types of bread for us to take notes on. We also got wine, amazing pizza fresh out of the oven, and bread to snack on. All SO good. We made bread there and then also went home with our own loaves of unbaked dough, which upon following the instructions we were sent home with, came out heavenly. I haven't been upstairs since they converted it to just a restaurant, but the old eat in / take out was amazing; the food is absolutely jaw dropping and I used to love stopping in for a slice of pizza and some Italian cookies on my way home from work.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"I am SHOCKED that what was once a parade of solid, glowing 4 star reviews - that has now transformed into a steady stream of 1 star reviews from the last 1-2 months - isn't scaring the hell out of Pepe Bocca enough to change their tune. The service here was the worst I've ever experienced for food I have paid for. Slow, inattentive, no checking in. There was absolutely no urgency from anyone in the entirto make sure we were happy and fed. When the food finally did arrive after waiting an hour - in an order that made absolutely no sense: 1 pizza, appetizer 20 min later, second pizza 10 min after that - I found it to be bland and uninspired. Not worth the wait and certainly not a value for the price. I agree with the other reviewer - come here if you're ok with mediocre food, terrible service, and have a minimum of 2 hours to burn staring at your table mates wondering WTF is going on in the kitchen. I will never come back here again. Pepe Bocca, word travels fast and Yelpers will see that you're not doing enough to right this ship. These reviews demonstrate a clear pattern of what your customers want and if you don't listen, I am certain you won't be around much longer.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"I never just walk into a restaurant. Why would I, when I have Yelp and the rest of the Internet to steer me in the right direction. Because of that, I rarely get stuck with a bad meal. In fact it's been so long that I forgot how angry a bad meal makes me.Well, tonight I got to visit those old feelings.Pepe Bocca, an Italian restaurant tucked into an Italian speciality store, proved themselves entirely incapable of even the most basic functions of food service.We waited fifteen minutes before someone even offered us a hello. And that was only after some arm flailing to get his attention. Our server, who was also pulling double duty as host, was so flustered and confused that he had to break out an ""it's my first day.""We ordered two pizzas and a charcuterie board. The first pizza took a half hour, and the second pizza and the charcuterie took a full hour. The entire time we sat in uncomfortable chairs in a sweltering room, envious of every single person that walked past us on Highland Ave because they didn't have to deal with top to bottom incompetence.On a Friday night there was one person in the kitchen. There appeared to be at least two servers and one bus person helping the two tables outside and one first day'er handling the entire inside.When the food did appear, it was a disaster. The dough on the margherita pizza was pillowy and inconsistent, and the slices fell apart in our hands. The mushroom pizza was underdressed and seemingly lacked ingredients, like the promised bÃ©chamel sauce. The charcuterie, in addition to taking an hour, was an uninspired mess. Too-hard salami, too-thick prosciutto, sickly sweet and gummy balsamic, and cheese that paired with noting. And no bread or toast.It is almost invigorating to hate a meal this much. It's a unique and exquisite kind of treat to be this disappointed and have it cost us $80.Never, ever go there.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"My boyfriend used to come here when it was a sandwich place, which he absolutely loved. He wanted to give the restaurant a try, so we stopped by on a Wednesday evening. The place was empty and we were seated immediately. The server recognized my boyfriend from when it was a sandwich place and they chatted about the renovations. She served us some freshly baked olive bread, and later avocado infused bread, which were both unique but didn't taste that amazing. I ordered the gnocchi and my boyfriend the eggplant parmesan, which were strangely the only two options listed under the pasta portion of the menu. My gnocchi was in the oven too long so some of it was a little burnt/overcooked. It tasted like any other gnocchi, and in my opinion was quite overpriced. The eggplant parm had no eggplant to be found. The server saw our dissatisfaction and offered to prepare some spaghetti for my boyfriend for his bowl of what appeared to be just sauce and meatballs. When that arrived, the pasta, which they had prepared with another red sauce, was extremely undercooked. Disappointed, my boyfriend just polished off the meatballs (decent, but not the same as the delicious meatballs in the former deli's meatball subs, according to my boyfriend). We received the check, and the server was very kind and offered us a slice of cake because of our disappointment. As sad as he was, my boyfriend said he won't be back again until Pepe Bocca returns as a sandwich place.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"2,"Appetites are a lot like getting a chubby: Use it or lose it.With the latter, the problem is staying full for too long while with the former, the problem is staying too empty. Â In either case, you lose interest if you're kept waiting for too long. Â This restaurant gets the 2018 Blueball Prize for the longest wait time I've ever experienced.*I ordered a prosciutto and Parmesan pizza and Miss K ordered a pan-fried salmon dish in a light caper sauce. Â It took an hour and fifteen minutes for these dishes to arrive. Â In the meantime, we were given some light antipasti to fill our stomachs with an apology from the one person tending to the entire place.However, I don't think one server is a good excuse for a number of reasons.Most importantly, the place is small and we were the only ones in there for a while followed by three other people. Â I've never waited tables but I don't think those numbers are particularly challenging for either the wait staff or the kitchen staff. Â I think I could have been quicker if I showed up to work high on skag with my apron tied around my eyes like a Bedouin.Salmon cooks quickly. Â The most time-consuming aspect of that dish is letting the jus develop flavor. Â That's seven minutes at most. Â It shouldn't take longer than ten minutes from beginning to end unless you're still waiting for the vegetables to grow.Pizza cooks very quickly if you have a wood-fired oven. Â We were told that the chef built the oven himself and it needed some adjustment, hence the delay. Â This is a classic ""out"" for restaurants who don't function well. Â They know you can't disprove claims about kitchen staff and equipment. Â You know you can't disprove those claims. Â They KNOW that YOU know you can't disprove it.So you're forced to accept the excuse and wait. Â I hoped it meant that the chef was a perfectionist and I would soon be enjoying slices of some of the best pizza I'd ever had.I was wrong.When it came out, it looked like something a fourth-grader had made in a cooking class his parents forced him to attend. Â The prosciutto was thrown on messily and there were a few haphazardly placed slices of shaved Parmesan sitting on the prosciutto. Â The sauce was completely flavorless. Â I can forgive modest amounts of cheese and loosely-placed meat as long as there's a lot of meat (and there was) but the sauce is very important. Â It just tasted like a thinned tomato purÃ©e. Â A pizza sauce is supposed to be basic but it usually involves a little bit of cooking, at least with some sautÃ©d onions and garlic.The crust had a nice char and texture and it was by far the best part of the pizza. Â I ate two large slices because that was the only meal I was having that day but it was purely to refuel myself. Â I took no pleasure in the experience. Â If this was sex, it would have been one of those lays you can barely remember because the other person just lay there, more frigid than a nun in Volgograd. Â I call it stopping for gas. Â It's one of the hard truths of life you have to live with.I also wanted to see whether I could improve the leftover slices at home. Â With some mozzarella, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes, it was much better. Â I think Pepe should consider adding just a few chunks of fresh buffalo mozzarella to the base of the pizza to hold everything together. The shaved Parmigiano should go both on the bottom with the mozz and a little bit on top and it should be melted.Melted Parmesan is for pizzas. Â Dry shaved Parm is for salads.Miss K's salmon was actually pretty good and that's why I'm giving this place one more star than I would if I was judging it on the pizza and service alone. Â There was a great charred crust on the salmon, which was cooked perfectly, and the jus was subtly tangy, a flavor profile that complemented the fresh veggies on top perfectly.It took fifteen minutes for the dude to get our check. Â By this time, we'd noticed that another server had started taking orders. Â But, like the old man, there was a puzzling hesitation, almost fear, in the new server's manner. Â They were both polite enough but it seemed like Pepe Bocca listed ""Must be recovering agoraphobe"" in its ad for waiters.I noticed a sluggishness in the kitchen too where people were moving with a remarkable lack of urgency. Â It was past 7 p.m. in a sit-down restaurant for Christ's sake. Â Dinner service should have you scrambling like the third-class people on the Titanic. Â Pretend my mouth is a lifeboat and fill it. Â Fast.Other patrons were waiting for their orders and looking around as well. Â One couple had been waiting almost as long as we had and while we were paying our check, the guy got up to have a stern word with the first server. Â We skipped dessert and when we finally got our check, I felt like Billy Zane did when he used that slum child to get into a lifeboat.____________________*Beating out Barcelona in Brookline. Â This place made Barcelona seem like a deli counter.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"A very good dinner with two friends in a restaurant that was pretty quiet for midweek. Perhaps that's just because it was the day before Valentine's? Anyway, we had great service.Their bread is excellent with olive oil. Try not to eat too much of it!I opted for the classic lasagna which comes with two small meatballs. It was not a very big portion but quite tasty. Presented nicely in a small ceramic dish that's also used in the oven to heat it. No points off for that - you don't make lasagna per customer like you do with a pizza. *smile*We opted not to have dessert.The restaurant also has a bunch of Italian goodies for sale including pastas, sauces, and wines. A nice selection of cooking stuff too, if you're looking for a ravioli assembly tray.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"What a great find! It's super cute inside - everything is wooden and feels super handcrafted and homey! Â My friend and I ordered the Prosciutto and Fig pizza as well as the lasagna + meatball to share and we left STUFFED! I'm such a sucker for Proscitto and the pizza was delicious! The cheese was slightly too salty for my taste, but I loved the combo of prosciutto, sweet figs, balsamic vinegar, and a handful of greens. Every bite was super flavorful and the crust was also crispy, buttery delicious! It kind of reminded me a bit of a croissant because of its texture and flakiness. And it definitely held up under the weight of all the toppings! The lasagna and meatballs were tasty and definitely homemade with lots of TLC! It was a super tasty meal, and if I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely have to come back!!",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"The Funghi pizza was amazing! Highly recommend! The waitress service was great! Can't wait to go back during lunch because their lunch menu looks amazing. If you want to get the Italian fill without being in Italy, this is the place to go! Great selection of wines, reasonable priced. My glass of Pinot Grigio was $8 and it was crisp.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"Strap in and get ready for a RIDE if you ever choose to eat at Pepe Bocca. Let me start by breaking it down:1 star food1 star service 5 STAR SHOW I don't know how else to write this review except chronologically. Thank goodness I started taking notes during dinner because this experience was FIRE (not literally). My husband and I had a 7:30 reservation on a Friday night. We arrived a few minutes early and were seated right around 7:30. The waitress comes by a few minutes later and my husband orders a bottle of wine. Around 7:45 my husband waves over the waitress and we order an app, entrees, and the bottle of wine (again). At 8 o'clock, right around when our app (which was the cheese and meat board) was delivered, we can hear the couple next to us getting upset. Since we arrived we hadn't seen the waitress come to their table once. At around 8:15 we started chit chatting with the upset couple. Their wine was empty. They were out of bread. They had been there since 7:15 and hadn't yet gotten their food and also hadn't had a waitress come by in nearly 45 minutes. They were mad. After joking around about just leaving they finally decide they can't wait anymore and walk out. That was at 8:38pm. Yes, it had been an hour and 15 minutes since they ordered and an hour since the waitress had even spoken to them. At 8:40 we hear a four top ask for status - they ordered their food an hour ago and wanted to eat sometime that night. At 8:44 the waitress shows up at the empty table with the entrees that couple ordered. She got mad at US! That table had been ignored when there were warm bodies there and then sat empty for 6 minutes. Yea this is my fault - the person not sitting there. Waitress - ""did they leave?!"" Me - ""yes"" Waitress - ""without paying??!!?!?"" Me - ""well you ignored them for an hour.""At 8:50 my husband and I joke that the reason the food is taking so long is they're making my lasagna with a blow torch. Does it help that the kitchen was an open kitchen and we could see everything going on - which was very little - or that there's a weird second kitchen in the back with just random pots of water sitting around? I don't know. I'm not a chef I guess. But we started seeing the kitchen melting down at this point. The waitress told the chef (who was literally the only person in the kitchen) that a table left without paying and he STORMED THE F OUT. It was gold. At 8:51 pm a family asks for status and the waitress confirms that, yes - the person making all the food, the chef - left. So the family leaves. A two top leaves. Another four top leaves. The waitresses are crying.My husband and I have been talking to two other couples and we are actually wondering, are we on a reality tv show? A diff couple says ""maybe this is some sort of experiment for someone's PHD program."" TOTALLY PLAUSIBLE because I've never experienced a night like this. But at 8:52 my husband and I decide, we've had enough. Whatever social experiment this was, we were actually hungry. Also, after nearly an hour and 45 minutes waiting maybe we should just accept that our food was never coming. The hubs asked for our check and our waitress said our food would be delivered in less than 10 minutes. At this point the chef walks back in, this time with ANOTHER CHEF! I didn't believe the waitress so I set a timer on my phone. The second we hit 10 minutes we were leaving. At the 9 minute mark - you will not believe this - THE CHEF TAKES A BLOW TORCH TO A PLATE OF LASAGNA. would you believe it was my lasagna? If you've seen this movie you know that it is. Right at the 10 minute mark my husband's gnocchi and my blow-torch-lasagna are delivered. The food was super not good and def not worth the wait or the cost. But I would eat here again in a heartbeat if I can be guaranteed another show. So, long story short. If you don't like good Italian food and you have minimum two hours to burn - I would highly recommend Pepe Bocca",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"I loved the old grab-and-go concept, but the new sit-down one sadly isn't working. The restaurant has been looking full, but I'm guessing it's because everyone is waiting an unacceptably long time for their food.My friends and I had a 7 pm reservation on Wednesday night. We got two pasta dishes, one eggplant parm, and a personal pizza--nothing too different from what they sold before. We waited 2 hours for the pastas and eggplant parm, and 2.5 hours for the pizza. The owner was very arrogant about it, said that ""good food takes time,"" blamed the freshness of the ingredients... but the food was also mediocre. We saw my friend's gnocchi sit under a heat lamp for 45 minutes (which the owner denied), and it was mush by the time we got it.Please go back to the old concept! I really loved Pepe Bocca and want to see you succeed, but you cannot make customers wait this long and justify it with ""good food takes time."" Some empathy for your customers while you work out the kinks will go a long way.I will caveat that they gave us each a free glass of wine and desserts, and our server was very kind.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"As many reviews have stated, Pepe used to be a perfectly rustic, top-notch eatery for both sit-in and take-out. Their food was the best Italian in the area and the pizza/deli/dessert section was exactly what locals wanted: delicious convenience; we don't need/want more overpriced fancy sit-down places, even if their service did eventually run smoothly. You stood out in Davis for not being like the rest of Davis.If anything, please let the takeaway of this review be: RETURN TO OLD PEPE! Your business will thrive and your people will happily return! Quick amazing service is what we want.My bf and I went to Pepe for dinner. Ordered our food. Bread came and that was the last thing we'd eat there. Waited 50 minutes for our 2 entrees. My bf went to our server, asking for the update, to which he was told ""I'll go check."" Our server didn't update us and instead flurried around the kitchen, the staff getting visibly mad at one another. I swear they tried to cook our dishes 3x because after 65+ minutes of patient waiting we walked out. And so did the couple next to us. At least 3 other tables were fully served before us - and they arrived way after!!Please return to old Pepe cuz that setup was the bomb and we're sad about that loss.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Great spot for a group of friends and delicious food! Walking into the store, there are fresh pastries, fresh cheese and meats, and an assortment of pastas to buy. We ordered sandwiches and sat on a large picnic bench on the other side of the store. The decoration is minimal, but everything you need is there! They have a TV that was showing a soccer game and a jug of water with lemons and ice! The food was nothing short of fantastic! The bread was soft and chewy and the ingredients were all super fresh. I got a prosciutto sandwich with mozzarella cheese and vegetables. The meat was salty and tender, the cheese tasted very fresh and the vegetables were the perfect topping. My friend got the avocado sandwich with wild mushrooms. The avocado was a small spread at the bottom of the sandwich, but the mushrooms and pesto tasted fantastic! You can have wine and small side dishes with your meal. The space is roomy and the staff was all very nice! Great place for a Saturday lunch or to hide away from the summer heat! :)",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"I went to this restaurant a few days ago. I made a reservation on a Friday at 6:30 p.m. When I showed up, multiple tables were available.. Bad sign.Everyone was complaining about the waiting times, some people had been waiting for more than one hour! I ordered the gnocchi and the Lasagna... I waited for 45 minutes and the plates never came... I told them I was leaving since I had movie tickets, they did not care, they did not apologize, they just canceled the orders and that was it!Since you can see the kitchen area from your table, I was able to hear all the employees screaming at each other, it was a complete mess! What a stressful place to have dinner.This was extremely disappointing and I am not coming for obvious reasons. Do you want affordable italian food in this area? Please drive 2 miles and go to Twirl in Arlington, that's an amazing place!",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"Pepe Bocca is not ""Good for Lunch"", as their Yelp page would have you believe, because they in fact do not even serve lunch any more. They used to be a fantastic lunch spot where you could grab a delicious sandwich or Italian entree, but for some reason they decided to transition into an overpriced, sit-down, dinner-only restaurant. Please turn this ship around!",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Pepe Bocca's is still evolving following a recent renovation this past summer. The spot is a one-stop shop offering everything from sit-down dinners, specialty groceries to a quick bite at lunch from a takeout corner. Although some items in the shop are a bit overpriced, Pepe's remains a foodie paradise and a gem in the neighborhood. Their espresso and cannoli are always on point. The focaccia pizza is also fantastic and Wagner who has been working this station is one of the friendliest people you'll meet this side of the Charles River! The only underwhelming item I have tried was the lasagna, but maybe that's because my expectations were high given my experience otherwise! Overall, definitely worth a stopping by for the best pizza and cannoli in the area.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"3,"I loved this spot when it was an Italian market of sorts. The sandwich counter was amazing along with the fresh breads and other baked goods. The pizza is the best in the area by far. I never ordered any serious meal there while it was operating as a market (lacking any better way to describe it). I did meet one girl who did and she waited an hour to receive her order (ravioli) while never receiving an update from the folks making the plate. That said, the three star rating is for the service. Pepe's food is VERY good, but management has done a poor job. Before it transitioned to its current restaurant status order fulfillment took a while and order taking was a confused process. From the recent reviews, that has carried over to Pepe's run as a restaurant. I used to work around that by calling in an order at least 45 minutes beforehand (even for a couple sandwiches) but that's no longer an option.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"I really like it here. They have cleaned it up a lot recently and the atmosphere has definitely improved. The food is genuine and comforting. I would take a first date here. It is quiet, simple and nice.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"Ok I was trying HARD to not eviscerate Pepe B but these other completely hysterical and accurate one star reviews have inspired me to lay bare my soul. My daughters and I wandered into this culinary abyss on a cold winters night, looking for some Italian sustenance. Like other reviewers, we stood in the entryway for upwards of seven minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence. Someone, that is, other than the one other table of patrons Who were in the joint. Looking back, I think one of them was trying to make eye contact with me -perhaps to tell me by way of eye blink Morse code to head for ze hills. Alas I missed the cue, and my daughters and I were eventually seated at an enormous family style table by ourselves. The waiter, a bumbling, fumbling chap (who seemed like he had dropped out of the ceiling from some bizarro dimension) promptly informed us that the wood fired oven pizza was really awesome, and also it would take over an hour to make. I shit you not--he told Â us no less than five times: ""it's really great though, the chef makes the dough in the basement."" As if that was some kind of selling point. Pizza. Dough. made. in. A. basement. Â Let's pause and consider that this so called excellent pizza would take over an hour. There was precisely one other party in the establishment at the time. A pizza from Mikes around the corner might take 15 minutes. A frozen pizza takes 20 minutes. But Pepe Bocca's pizza Was so goddamn good, with its basement crafted dough, that it was going to take over an hour to be served. So we opted for three servings of gnocchi which was the only other thing on the menu besides lasagna. For some reason that stopped the waiter in his tracks, and it occurred to me that maybe the gnocchi was also made in this magical basement and was therefore also going to take ""over an hour."" But the garÃ§on assured me that this dish was NOT basement-crafted so would be plated in under 30 minutes. I then proceeded to order a glass of wine and two drinks for my children and I won't even get into how long we waited to get those drinks while this buffoon stood behind a screen staring at the wall. Finally the gnocchi arrived and it was sub par at best. Mealy and sparse, swimming in burnt, overly salted sauce. By this point there was no disguising my displeasure, and I asked the waiter to bring the check. He then vaporized for another ten minutes. When he finally reappeared, I waved him over and asked for the check again, to which he replied ""oh didn't I already bring you that?"" Allow me to remind you all that there was still only Â one other party in the joint. As we were leaving I realized that this was the same party that was seated when we came in. They must've ordered pizza.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Cute Italian market that also doubles as a good place to grab lunch (pizzas, sandwiches etc). I've only been once so far and had a pretty good experience. Husband and I stopped by to try their lunch options, we each got a sandwich and coffee. I had a portobello, husband had the Italian. Coffee was good. Both sandwiches were very solid, but my reason for a 4/5 is because they didn't wow me. Perhaps it's biased and unfair, but I love Dave's Fresh Pasta and because they seem to offer similar products and food options I can't help but compare. I would definitely come again to try their other lunch options. Tip: there's two food counters to check out, one for cold subs sandwiches, and coffee which is where we ordered. Another that seemed to offer hot options like pastas, pizzas, paninis etc. I would also come back to check out their market options. While quickly browsing, I saw they had imported products like coffee makers and pasta, and fresh bread.",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"1,"Unfortunately I wasn't able to try anything here as service was very poor. We walked in at 815 on a Friday night directly next to another table who had been there a bit. While the server walked over to their table to drop off food not once, but twice, he never even acknowledged our presence or let us know he'd be a minute. After sitting for 10 minutes with no one coming by we walked out, which I'm disappointed about because I was excited to try the food as the menu looked good!",Pepe Bocca,"414 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Juliet is one of our neighborhood favorites--we've been here for brunch and dinner. In general, we love the open kitchen concept and the preparation of dishes that use fresh, local ingredients, and let those ingredients speak for themselves.

We were in Boston for a wedding, and wanted to have a nice brunch the morning of. We found this place while exploring on Google, and it sounded nice.It was the perfect choice. It was in a cute little neighborhood and had a very homey feel. It was a smaller establishment, but I think it was good for the feel of the restaurant. This place is a tip free establishment, which is really cool. The servers get paid an established wage, but the prices of the food don't seem to reflect it. They were friendly and easy going. We started with a bloody Mary, which was delicious, and we ordered the Riviera sandwich and breakfast burger with a fried egg. Both items came with a small salad and some potatoes. The potatoes were different, but pretty good. They had dill and some mustard or horseradish. We also had a ginger molasses cookie and a cranberry cream cheese coffee cake. The whole meal was delicious, and I would recommend it to a friend. Hopefully, someday I can go back and try some other items.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"3,"I had high expectations for this restaurant but the entire menu was so highly focused on egg dishes and trying too hard to be ""crunchy"". I ordered the maple sugar toast which was just a $5 wet piece of bread, not warm & toasted, with a sugary spread on it.Next up was the main course of an egg sandwich. It's hard to mess up and egg sandwich but I found it unappetizing and hard to eat. Served on ""fresh"" pita, this pita bread was hard, maybe stale, and difficult to bite into. The first bite I took, the entirety of the inside slid out and had to eat the entire sandwich with a fork and knife. The combination of one egg, hummus, feta and pesto was rather gross.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Juliet makes wonderful food, and I particularly loved their deserts (or maybe they're better called snacks, or treats). I ordered the burger, with an egg, and loved every bite. The bloody mary was delicious as well. But my favorite was the ginger molasses bar. It was super good. One unfortunate thing about eating at Juliet is that it's rather small.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Came on Thursday for dollar oysters. Oysters were good for a $1 but as most $1 oysters you can't expect them to be quite as good as the expensive ones. The place is super cute, we sat at the bar and had no wait. The menu is limited so check it out before you go go. We had a delicious mushroom cream and spinach pasta. THey did not skimp on the mushrooms which I really appreciate, all types and sizes. Cooked to perfection. Really nice but a tad too lemony if you ask me. Still great though. Also a lamb burger with amazing tzatziki sauce that I loved. Left nice and pink in the middle it wasn't overly greasy. Really good roasted potatoes on the side as well. Also had a ""Rachel's in charge', essentially a negroni with tequila instead of gin. This was probably the weakest part of the meal. Like the drink tasted weak. A bit too much vermouth, not enough campari or tequila... or maybe tequila just isn't as flavorful. Either way, I might stick to beer next time.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"2,"tl;dr Great Decor, Great wait staff, alright food.My gripe with brunch places is that there usually isn't anything I can't cook myself at home in the same amount of time it takes me to go to a brunch place, get seated, order, and wait for my food to come. And this place to me just reconfirmed that. I ordered some fish tacos while my friends ordered more classic brunch plates with toast, eggs and a salad of some form. None of it was that amazing and the fish tacos were rather small and not satiable. The potato salad basically consisted of raw potatoes that IMO were inedible. The eggs were fine, but really how hard is it to cook an egg. The only part I liked was that the wait staff are paid fairly, so not tipping involved.Otherwise, don't see the hype, nothing special, pretty bland food. Would not recommend.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"5,We stopped here for a quick bite to eatMy daughter had hummus with caramelized onion and a carmelized grapefruit I ordered the Greek Easter sandwich with gruyere and mushroom asparagus and cauliflower baguette sandwichCute ambiance.

Great.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"3,"I was excited to try this place because of the good reviews on Yelp, but I was honestly a little let down. I had the Captain Leo's Breakfast ($16), which included toast with cream cheese and sliced tomatoes, a small greens salad, a soft boiled egg, and potato salad. The potato salad was very hard and tasted too raw, and everyone else at my table who had it as part of their dish thought the same. Everything else was only decent. My americano had a nice layer of crema though and was pretty good tasting. Service was also friendly and reasonably fast. I probably won't be bad because the food quality was lower than expected for the prices.They don't take reservations for brunch; wait was about 30 minutes on a Saturday at noon.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"The place is small but the food is delish. When you look at the kitchen and then eat the food, you're just like whattttt how did they make that from that kitchen? Big fan of this place for lunch. Prepare for a wait, but they do have a ""cafe"" where you can order some coffee and pastries and munch on those while you wait for a table. My girlfriend's scrambled eggs dish was delish. My bagelsaurus egg sandwich was delicious albeit not healthy compared to other dishes. I do want to try their soft boiled egg dish. The salmon toast was killer. Great fish quality (sushi grade).

It is great vibes, great food, great greatness. Don't hesitate, the future is now.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Food: A very interesting menu that this breakfast venue created. If you are a type of foodie that likes to try different food combinations, this place is definitely a place to try. The meal I ordered was something I was not used to. It was delicious however I found some parts of it a bit overpowering (maybe if they put less on the plate I wouldn't feel obligated to eat it all haha) but I don't regret ordering what I ordered at all!Cost: A bit expensive for breakfast. For example, the caramelized grapefruit was a couple dollars. A bit steep but it was delicious though! Just be aware that it is the cost of both the food and experience that you are paying for.Environment: Very quaint. Although the exterior of the restaurant doesn't really stand out, the interior is something to definitely take a look at. They utilized antique items to decorate the place and it worked out very well! Service: The server was amazing! Everyone in the restaurant seemed to really enjoy working there and that was reflective of the attitude they gave to the customers. Uniqueness: I did not know of this until the end as the bill was about to get paid but they do not accept tips! It was such a surprise, especially because they did such an awesome job. There is a basket towards the front that is open to anyone who is willing to donate money for a funding that they do. I don't remember the specifics but I have never seen anything like this!Not a place to go everyday but definitely once in a while when in the area. Both to have an interesting meal but also support a good cause.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"This place boils down to four words: overpriced, hippie bird feed.Nevertheless, it still deserves a 4-star in my book. This is why: even though the brunch menu items are on the pricey side, with rather small portions (the bird feed part), the bang for buck ratio is still good because the quality of food you would get here is high. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh, probably purchased locally, and from a farmers market. I really like their business model of profit-sharing between the owner and all the employees working there (the hippie part). Despite this place being kind of pricey for what you get, I support fair compensation for the employees, so I don't mind paying a little more than normal for brunch food.They also have an open kitchen inside the cafe so you can see exactly how your food is made. The cafe itself is very clean, which I like alot. They don't ask you for a tip on top of your bill. What you see is what you get since they pay their employees fairly and everyone has a share of the cafe.I had the brunch item with eggs, toast, and smoked salmon (forgot what it was called), and a latte. Their latte is delicious! Definitely get it if you are there. While the smoked salmon dish I got was good and healthy (not your typical greasy American brunch food), my only complaint of this place is their portion size. As you can see, I am not exactly a bird nor am I on a diet. If their portion size were bigger, I would not have left the cafe feeling a bit hungry (the only thing I thought they could improve on)....if it wasn't for the portion size, I would certainly give this place a 5-star.Oh, and if you get coffee here, they also would refill it for free, which is always a perk!",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"5,"I've watched Somerville's steady gentrification over the last 20 years, so a fancy toast restaurant seemed like the natural next step. Â Although it took me a year, I'm glad I finally managed to get over my skepticism and stop by, because Juliet is a neighborhood gem!This review is for the prix fixe dinner ($69 for 3 courses, $90 for 5 courses). The menu makes use of plenty of fresh, seasonal vegetables and flavors. The offerings change every couple of weeks--check their website for more info!The April/early May menu featured roasted lamb, but Chef Josh was kind enough to make a vegetarian version for me, substituting roasted cauliflower. I really didn't feel like I was missing out--the cauliflower was covered in a rich beurre blanc sauce with tons of fresh herbs and lemon! Â I'm not very strict about animal products like caviar, fish sauce, and lard, but they were super careful about finding substitutions for all of these ingredients. You can add wine pairings, but I opted for the nonalcoholic turmeric tonic instead. Whether or not turmeric has any health benefits, I enjoyed the light flavor and beautiful golden color of my beverage!The only criticism I have is that I think they could potentially benefit from a separate pastry chef. Dessert was my least favorite course; the texture of the pound cake was off.I love that they include tip in the prices, and I hope this practice catches on at other Somerville restaurants. Besides the fact that it's better for the waitstaff, it's more convenient not to have to waste time calculating the tip at the end of your meal! Â So even though the menu is a bit pricey, it's not as bad as it seems once you remember that tip is included.Juliet will join Bergamot and L'Espalier my list of great prix fixes in this area, and I can't wait to come back and try breakfast!",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"3,"It was... fine. For something that's marketed as a whole ""experience,"" for which you have to buy tickets in advance, it was decidedly underwhelming. Nothing was really bad but nothing rose to the level of what they seem to be selling. We did the ""Beach Rose"" dinner, for $53 (including tip) per person, then spent a couple more bucks per person on drinks. My favorite dishes were probably the first two: the complimentary bread, which was slightly sweet and very soft, accompanied by chili butter and lobster roe (couldn't taste it), and the burrata, which had preserved lemon and microgreens and was a light way to start the meal. The main course took a while to come out to us, and it was served family-style (we had four people). The poached hake was a little salty, and the vegetables (carrots, radishes, zucchini) were so randomly and roughly chopped that they weren't cooked evenly. I tried to stab a pretty raw and hard carrot (which I understand is edible, but threw me off when everything else in the mix was much more tender). Then we got a palate cleanser pickle dish of (I think) zucchini and onion. It was sweeter than I would prefer and didn't do much for me -- I actually think the Â flavor was kind of heavy, for a palate cleanser. Â The dessert was a strawberry shortcake. It was a little dry overall. There were two little halves of a biscuit, some roasted strawberries and just a hint of whipped cream. Portions are small; my one guy friend said he was about 60% full at the end. Since we picked the early dinner option we couldn't add supplements, which can be ordered at an extra cost. The restaurant is cute but the tables are all crowded to one side. I get that during the day there are people ordering baked goods to go at the counter area near the door, but at night it seems like you could spread things out so people aren't so close to each other. They also need better ventilation, because it got smoky throughout the evening. Service was fine but the pacing was slow. We spent two full hours there for a three-ish course meal (and we didn't even have to place our orders), which feels a little excessive.I like the idea of the restaurant but not the execution. Including tip seems reasonable and I like the seasonal approach, but the overall experience just wasn't impressive.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Updating this review since Josh, the owner, reach out re: costs. ""Our staffing model is different than most restaurants with everyone making a living wage and no one working for tips"" is what he said. I really did feel like the model of Juliet was different and that everyone was working toward the common goal of making sure you had a great experience and not overly nice to work for tips (as I've done as a server haha). Can't wait to join them for dinner!__________________________________________I found this charming place on our way home from the dog park. We were able to grab a table outside with our dog. I had never been and walked inside to the counter, the design of this place was really nice. The open kitchen is what impressed me the most. A chic, upscale restaurant without being too pompous. Someone helped me and kindly explained that it wasn't a full service, but if we ordered, it was brought to the table.I ended up getting tea and the Parisienne breakfast with toast, soft boiled eggs and butter/jam and my boyfriend got a latte and something else that we can't seem to remember what it was called. Absolutely delicious though.It was a little pricey, but I enjoyed the aesthetics and how well/quickly we were served. Would definitely come back again.",Juliet,"257 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Carmelina's is true to its tagline ""Twist on Tradition"" and they're twisting me in all the right ways (heh-heh)! The Boy and I made a lunch rez to come as part of his 'eat-all-the-Carbonaras-in-Boston' kick. Good thing we did because the tables were pretty full (~1PM on a Saturday - you definitely could still walk-in and grab a seat though if you are a gamblin' man ... or woman).To start, you are promptly served water and given a plate of warm, fluffy, light bread with a olive oil & balsamic dip. We ate two servings of this ... it was that good. We also split their take on a Caprese Salad. A very smooth bufala mozzarella served with a beautiful palate of tomatoes (green, orange, & red). The plate had a ring of balsamic around the outside and a perfect portion of fresh pesto underneath the magical mozzarella. Combine each individual aspect of this dish on your fork for the PERFECT bite! My only minor gripe was there were more tomatoes than everything else but that is to be expected.The Boy's carbonara was great. He thought it was a little more alfredo-y/saucy than he liked - maybe because it lacked an egg - but the taste itself was still really good.I decided to give puttanesca sauce a first try here because I saw the word ""spicy"" in front of ""puttanesca sauce."" Unfortunately, I did not know puttanesca sauce was heavy on olives; I found it to be VERY salty instead of 'spicy' although I have no other puttanesca experience to compare it to. That being said, I still enjoyed my dish, took home the leftovers, and finished it the next day ... albeit it, I threw a fried egg on top and called it breakfast. A runny yolk helped cut the saltiness. I ate it all at the end of the day so that is not a testament against their puttanesca but a compliment to how great their pasta at its foundation is.100% will be returning to Carmelina's because I NEED to try the Tonno con Pesto Siciliano e Fusilli (it's ahi tuna on fusilli in pesto sauce!) and also the Crazy Alfredo (chicken AND sausage in - what I hope is true to its name - a SPICY alfredo sauce?!). Like I said, I'm diggin' the 'twist' Carmelina's is serving up!",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Ok, the crazy alfredo was some of the most delicious pasta I've ever had. I really dislike heavy food, but for such an indulgent dish, I felt like I could keep eating and eating this dish. Of course it was greasy and heavy, but you never feel that way eating the dish! The pasta, made in house, was perfectly chewy. AHH I'm just drooling thinking about the dish. I also ordered the octopus salad dish - very lemony and fresh, great to counteract the crazy alfredo. My fiance also ordered the meatballs as an appetizer, which were delicious although I wish we were given more bread. The only mediocre thing about the restaurant was the bread...I feel like I'm used to a certain level of fluffiness in the north end, but this bread was just mediocre. Additional stars for being able to reserve seats online - a great plus for the north end.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"3,"The food was good, but not to the my expectations from reading the reviews on Yelp. It's located in the North End so it's definitely limited in seating. Get reservations if you can. We came with a party of 6 during lunch and were sat in the front. Thankfully the patio window was open or else we wouldn't be able to get into our seats! If you are sat in the front, the tables are situated very close together that the back of your seat is going to be touching the back of the person sitting behind you. We got quite a few things. The Gnocchi, carbonara, spaghetti with clams, crazy alfredo, meatball appetizer, fried calamari, and eggplant appetizer. Unfortunately, nothing really wowed us except the crazy alfredo. I would come back just for this dish. I've never seen it anywhere else and it was by far the best tasting. When reading the reviews, everyone said get the gnocchi. So we did. It seems like they bake the gnocchi so when you use your fork to stab it, it'll become mushy. It begins to clump with the other gnocchi and the next thing you know you have a plate of mashed potatoes. The carbonara says it's made the real way on the menu. I guess I'm not a fan of the real way. Oh, the free bread was pretty amazing. Super fresh with a semi hard outside and super soft inside. It also took a long time to get our entrees after we had finished our appetizers. Seems like they only have 1 chef preparing them.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Bronx Tale!OMG this is my new favorite meal in Boston's North End. It comes with 3 meatballs, and an Italian sausage, rigatoni in meat sauce. You have to be be quite hungry to finish it. The bread and butter could be improved (maybe they could get some from Panza's. They know Italian bread!). The calamari was just ok here and came with peppers instead of marinara sauce.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"A lovely spot in North End with home-cooked taste and an elegant atmosphere. It fills with reservations quickly but there's often room at the bar if you hang around. The cool thing with the bar is it's right next to the open kitchen so you can see all the magnificent dishes being made, complete with the occasional fireball! We had the fresh calamari salad and spicy shrimp. Both had fresh ingredients, good portion size even for appetizers, and a clear taste of quality. My only qualm was that the sauces were not that strong in flavor and personality. I was hoping for more richness and spice from the red sauce for the spicy shrimp, especially. The giant family sized pasta platters looked amazing and I can't wait to come back for that. Also, as the menu states, they cook carbonara ""the real way!""",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Wow, I can't believe I've missed out on Carmelina's until now.

Highly recommend reservations on a Friday or Saturday night since the place is on the smaller side and right in the heart of the North End. Started out with the Risotto Caprese. Real deal mozzarella and risotto were fresh and outstanding. You know the real thing when you taste it. No corners are cut here. For my main dish, got the Gnocchi al Forno. Pasta and mozzarella cheese just melts in the mouth. Potato pasta dumplings are something I can't stop talking and dreaming about. Also had some of the penne gorgonzola which was 5 star material. Chicken with burrata was delicious. Gotta try all of it. The adjectives used to describe the food just don't do it justice. Â They also provided complimentary hot fresh bread with oil and vinegar.Service was terrific. Waitress consistently checked on us and was quick.

We came back and were seated almost immediately. We had fried calamari for appetizer which were very good. Â Pasta Gorgonzola for me. Pasta and clams for the wife. Both dishes were top notch. Â  Small restaurant in a very busy area. I recommend you make a reservation. Great service from our hosts and waiters. Great attention to details from the chefs in regards to our allergy request. I would definitely recommend this place.,Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Believe the hype! But beware, this restaurant has ruined most other Italian restaurants for me. I came here with my husband for a late lunch on a Friday. We ordered meatballs as an appetizer and split the carbonara pasta dish. The meatballs were tender and the marinara sauce was lovely with fresh basil. The pasta was homemade, chewy, and delicious. I will say it was a bit heavy it was well worth the calories. The staff was friendly and attentive - even though there wasn't a single empty table. I can't wait to come back and try more pastas the next time we are in Boston!",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"I'm not from Boston so can someone please tell me, how in the world do you choose which restaurant to eat at in the North End?! Everything looked so good! For us, we were recommended Carmelina's and it did not disappoint!! The space was tiny (and seemingly always packed with patrons), but we had reservations so there was no wait at all. All the pastas are made in house so it was a difficult choice for me to make when it came to dinner entrees. We ended up going with the Penne Capricciose and Frutti di Mare and wow, oh wow. The pastas were perfectly cooked and the sauces were absolutely magnificent: bold and comforting at the same time. My mouth is watering just thinking about our meal here. My one regret, though, is not ordering an appetizer. Carmelina's has made it to the top of my list for some of the best Italian food I've had in my life! I would be curious as to how other restaurants in the area compare.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"This is an easy and quick review! Â Carmelina's is small, loud, fresh, and vibrantly Italian the Boston way! Â I ate at the bar watching my food be prepared - which I love as it adds a great dimension to the meal! Â The carbonara, while not traditionalism my else was authentically Boston! Â It was buttery rich, creamy and full of flavor! Â OMG! Â It was bigger and bolder than it ought to have been so again, it was carbonara PLUS! Â It had to start with 1/2 pound of prosciutto, thinly cut and then rendered, and of course 1/2 coup of butter! Â Did I mention it was better... It was great!This is a must stop for now on for me... you will love this place.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Had reservations here at 7 on Wednesday.Great bread. I wish they had offered us more. :(Got the Baked 4 mushroom rigatoni.Loved the texture of the breadcrunbs on top. I don't really like cheese, but loved this. The rigatoni were perfectly bit sized. There were the right amount of mushrooms, not too many not too few. It was cooked to order and came out nice and hot. I almost burned myself because it was so good that I didn't want to wait to eat it. Â When I came in I had a hard time deciding what to order because I don't Â like cheese and I wasn't that hungry, but I ended up gobbling up all my food. It was a perfect sized portion. Top notch service. The staff checked on us, refilled water, and brought and processed our check quickly. It was like a well-oiled mahcine. Our waiter read our minds and suggested Mike's and the Modern. He said he preferred the Modern for pastries in general and that Mike's was known for cannoli.Â  He recommended lobster tails and pistachio cannolis. An overall wonderful experience.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"2,"WHAT IS ALL THIS HYPE?!I decided on the carbonara because someone in front of me said that it was heavenly. While I wouldn't describe this dish as heavenly, it wasn't terrible. There was a good amount of pepper and pancetta in there and I did enjoy the thick, chewy pasta noodle they used. My friend got plain pasta and meatballs with red sauce. She said they whole dish was bland and that she hated the thick, chewy pasta noodle (same noodle as mine). The food overall was very mediocre in my opinion. The 2 star rating is for service. We came on a Saturday at 2:30p and the place was busy but not packed. The hostess told us that the wait would be 15 minutes for a table and we decided to wait. When we returned 15 minutes later, there were plenty of Â tables open but the hostess had not called us. She only seated us when we asked again. We were sat in a corner of the restaurant and I just felt ignored the entire time. Our waitress never came over to check on us (even though she had checked on the table next to us several times) and she never brought a lemon for our water or parmesan cheese for our pastas. Eventually we were tired of being ignored and had to ask the hostess for help.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,Oh my goodness! The food is so good here. My brother invited me to eat here and all I can say is they have excellent pasta dishes and I tried the carbonara and the gorgonzola pasta... Excellent! I also tried the Brasato dish which is braised beef and sampled some risotto Â that came with it and frutti de mare. I just love this place. It's very small but the service is very good I really enjoyed the atmosphere and I liked my server Daniela.,Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Nice vibe and great food. It's interesting to me that fried calamari is the dish that will show up on the menu for lots of different cuisine: Japanese, Italian, Spanish, etc. the fried calamari in Carmelina's will surprise you! It's a little bit spicy so it perfectly balance with the deep fried part. It doesn't taste oily and you won't get tired of it. North end is famous for the authentic Italian food so that just raise the bar higher for all the restaurants here. I like my pasta. It's authentic and tasty, but it didn't surprise me as much as the appetizer did.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"My husband and I were excited to snag reservations for lunch on a Saturday at 12:30 after a previous attempt where we were turned away during peak hours. Reservations HIGHLY recommended.We knew we were in for a treat as soon as our appetizer arrived -- the Ahi Tuna Arrabbiata. It's sushi-grade ahi tuna served slightly seared on a bed of crispy potatoes and topped with olive tapenade and fresh basil. It was as delicious as it was beautiful. Our entrees were equally impressive. My husband ordered the Sunday Macaroni and I ordered the Frutti di Mare. The pasta, the sauce -- it was all perfect; and the portions, generous -- even the protein! Our waitress was lovely, as was the ambiance. We loved that they opened their floor-to-ceiling windows on this nice day so we could soak in the fresh air.We found our new favorite to bring in out of town guest to taste the best of the North End!",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"I chose this restaurant solely because of the yelp reviews. While it did not disappoint, I still hesitate to give Carmelina's five stars. First, the meatball appetizer was to die for and is a must! The meals however left a bit to be desired after seeing how good the food could have been. My chicken entree was very good, but my girlfriend's carbonara was a bit too peppery and the noodles, while fresh, were far too thick. The price also holds back the 5 stars. While not unreasonable, don't expect a cheap dinner. I would recommend if you haven't had it, but I wouldn't make it a must stop on my next trip to Boston.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"North End has a ton of restaurants and Carmelina's is one of them that stood out to me due to the amount of food they give as well as the flavor and creativity of their dishes. I highly recommend making a reservation to this place (Which is what I did on Yelp). The restaurant is pretty small (but more tables than Daily Catch next door) and their biggest table can only seat 6. The menu has dozens of appetizers, pasta dishes, and main dishes to choose from. With four of us, we ordered pasta dishes such as Sunday Macaroni (one of their most popular dishes), the Crazy Alfredo, Spaghetti with Clams, and more. The Sunday Macaroni was a lot to the point where I ended up taking 2/3 of it home due to the amount of meatballs, sausage, and the beef rib they included with the pasta. However, my personal favorite of the dishes we had was the Crazy Alfredo, personally since I thought the spicy alfredo sauce that was used in this dish was rich in flavor, was unique, and was not heavy in cream.I highly recommend coming to Carmelina's if you are in North End looking for great Italian food. Definitely make a reservation if you are able to due to the popularity of this restaurant (which you can do in Yelp!).",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Delicious Italian! Showed up around 5:30 on a Wednesday and did not have to wait to be seated! Calamari app was great. Also loved the spaghetti with baby clams in white wine sauce, mussels and calamari with angel hair pasta (a littlespicey for me but hubby loved it) and, the penne Gorgonzola. Five stars would be given if they had kids menu and dessert/coffee, but they were accommodating making kid friendly pasta dish and we had more opportunity to try other places in the area for dessert!",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"We were in Boston to visit with my family and this place was on my list of places to try. It was also mother's day weekend and my mom's birthday so I wanted to take her out for a special lunch/dinner. I made a reservation on yelp actually for Sunday afternoon but when we arrived they said they didn't have one for us. Turns out it was 315 instead of the 415 which I thought I scheduled. The place was packed and the manager or hostess squeezed us in anyway which was very accomodating. We had to leave by a certain time but we were fine with that. FoodWe ordered a bottle of lambrusco for drinks to celebrate and started off with an appetizers. We ordered the eggplant and the clams both of which were phenomenal. The eggplant was breaded just right and the sauce was delicious. The clams were angry just like the menu stated. Spicy and delish! We each got a main course carbonara, seafood pasta, ahi tuna salad and the chicken Alfredo. I tried a little of everybody's and I have to say that they were all amazing. Carbonara was creamy Â and peppery. It was almost more like a cacio e pepe but just the same i finished my plate! The food came out piping hot and the bread was delicious too!I wasn't extremely impressed with the service but the food made up for what was lacking in that department so I let it slide.",Carmelina's,"307 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,7/18/18I didn't really get to see much inside. The hostess station was just inside the courtyard and it was gorgeous outside so I was seated promptly. It's not a large space outside but nice to enjoy the weather. My server was kind and efficient. Kept my drink full and checked in on me. I had the shrimp cocktail. I was craving a light lunch since I planned on doing a lot of walking and it was a perfect meal. Fat large sweet shrimp cooked perfectly tender. They tasted really fresh! Served on a bed of ice made them very refreshing as well. I did observe some burgers coming out to other tables and if looks tell the tale dang they looked yummy!,Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"1,Wow Â - just horrible service all around. Â Literally did not see our server until we had finished our appetizers (minus any plates) and our drinks. Glasses were empty and zero desire to return IMHO.,Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"1,"This place is no longer on my and my girlfriends go to places in Harvard Square. We came here for a late lunch / early dinner on Saturday. We were seated on the top floor near the bar area. The service was friendly and accommodating. There was some initial confusion because we were handed 2 different menus so we didn't know which was the accurate one. Once that was fixed, we ordered a dozen oysters, some drinks, and an order of fried calamari with shisito peppers. Unfortunately as we ate through the calamari dish, my girlfriend noticed something on the plate and asked me to look at it. It was definitely a dead bug (fried cockroach or grasshopper). I showed it to our server who profusely apologized. She also brought over the manager who also apologized but our appetite was ruined. We ordered a pizza but couldn't eat it knowing it came from the same kitchen. The service was friendly but the food was definitely a red flag. Nearby patrons saw our reactions and proceeded to leave as well. The manager was nice enough to take off most of the bill (still charging for oysters and drinks). We paid and left and vowed to never come back again.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"4,"Really tasty food and the prices are pretty reasonable. My boyfriend and I split the r. House burger, leek and mushroom pizza and Jonah crab cakes and it was more than enough food. The only dish I wasn't thrilled with was the crab cakes - they tasted super fishy in a not-great way. Everything else was delicious, and I especially loved the English muffin bun on the burger. Service was a bit slow but overall we had a good experience.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"Loved this tavern! The vibe, the atmosphere, the food, the customer service, the list can go on! I can't even begin to tell you how delicious my mojito was. Being an avid mojito drinker i know how difficult it is to find a good one. And any place that has brunch all day has my heart. The EBLT was amazing. I would definitely return!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"1,Suppose to be nice but when I saw 2 mice/rats run across the dining room floor I was totally skeeved out and on top of that I bit into a piece of long hair in my burger. Â the serving staff was amazing but it looks like the owner talk to them like they were pee ons I just remember one of the servers asking a simple question and the owner gave her a mean attitude for no reason. The only reason this restaurant is in business is because it's in the center of Harvard Square if it was any place else it probably be closed.,Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"2,"This is a major Boston establishment, but I was not wowed by the food. Â The majority of the menu was definitely designed for carnivores. Â The duck and the greens were my favorite, but the food was mostly just ok and not worth the price.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,I came here with a friend for drinks. It does look like it from the outside but they have 2 levels. The downstairs is twice the size of the top floor.They have a great cocktail list. My friend order a draft beer with their burger. The food came out really quick.The burger came with fries. It wasn't out of the ordinary but it was tasty. I would recommend this place if you need a quick beer after work.,Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"4,"Excellent ambience. Went during the snow storm tonight and was pleased to learn that they were serving up the full menu plus $1 oysters. I ordered the pan seared salmon over a bed of lentils - it was delicious and protein-rich. Just what I needed. I wanted something healthy and nutritious so this was perfect. My director had the oysters and a sausage and fennel pizza, which he liked but couldn't finish.Service was excellent and it's a very high energy restaurant. Would definitely come again whenever in Harvard square.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"A Harvard staple, Russell House Tavern is the hangout for students and tourists alike. It works for large groups for food, and as a drinking den.However I have mixed feelings about this place. On a Sunday night when I went it, it was relatively empty but exceptionally loud. Raucous clientele and unhelpful acoustics meant I couldn't even hear my dinner companion seated across from me. Surely there has to be some level at which decibels turn from pleasantly energetic to unacceptable because it drives away business.The food was okay - but why call something a extra Dirty Caesar salad when most of it is kale anyway? It so little resembles a Caesar that it's a kale salad anyway!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"Came here with a few friends for some drinks and late night food. I ordered a beer, my friends some mixed drinks. The waitress came over really quickly once we ordered our drinks. We got seated right away, it was a Monday night so not very busy. For food we ordered a flatbread pizza, after waiting probably almost 40 minutes the waitress came over and notified us the kitchen burned our pizza. They made us another one but even that one was a little burned as well. We had a great time regardless but not sure if I'd go back.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"4,"When I think of Russell House Tavern, I will remember the ambiance, the food, and the fact that the restaurant could use a few more lightbulbs (the basement is dimly lit!!)Ambiance is pleasant, soothing, ideal for family dinners, date night, Â celebratory meals, or if you're looking for a place for a post-work drink. The food was simple and traditional. Nothing to exotic or fancy - again which compliments the ambiance. You can confidently bring any type of eater and here and not be concerned about whether or not they will be able to find something on the menu. I ordered Heritage Pork 3 Ways (house made linguisa, tenderloin, and pork shoulder) over grits. It was phenomenal and one of the best pork dishes I've had a a restaurant to date. The tenderloin was tender and juicy. The pork shoulder was perfectly seasoned and melted in your mouth. The house made linguisa (Portuguese pork sausage) may not as well known, but it is a must try! The rest of the the table got the famous and popular Russell House Burger. I had a bite of the burger and can see why it is one of their most ordered items! Tender, juicy, prime beef burger between, *wait for it*, two english muffins for buns. Unbelievable.The staff were polite, friendly, and helpful. They were quick with recommendations for food and drinks tailored to your likes and dislikes. If you're in the area, I certainly would recommend this restaurant. Parking can be tough in Harvard Square but there are plenty garages in walking distance!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"4,"Right in the center of action. We enjoyed an Extra Dirty Caesar Salad, a Soup du jour and a couple drinks while seated in the window. We were shown our table quickly and the service was great. We were hoping for the atmosphere to be a little quieter and the salad to be dressed a little lighter...both minor! This is a great place to window watch!!!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"I was pretty excited to try this place because of all the passionate reviews! I was impressed by how large the place was. From the outside it looks like a first level tavern with outside seating - I was worried we might have to wait. This was on a Saturday at 3pm. However, there was a great round table for 5 downstairs waiting for us. The room was very dimly lit for such a nice day outside it was a stark contrast. The ambiance was nice and deserves a 4. However, the food was very subpar. I got a lobster slider - which had maybe the smallest amount of lobster I have seen smeared on a fairly dry bun with arugula. I split the grilled chicken Caesar salad with a friend. I wasn't expected to be blown away by a salad, but the lobster slider was disappointing. The boyfriend got the roast beef which was okay but nothing special. Someone else got the burger and I would expect it to be pretty great at a place like this - but it was very subpar. The fries were pretty delicious though. I don't think I would return with so many other food options in Harvard square.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"Very busy, even on a Monday night, for both outdoor and indoor seating. The food was delicious. My husband wasn't hungry so he got the spicy crispy calamari in the small plates menu and I got the pork three way in a entree menu. Funny enough his plate came bigger than mine. Lots of peppers and arugula on his plates though. He said his calamari was delicious. The pork was delicious, my favorite one was the sausage, i cleared it in 3 bites, the pork belly was fatty but yummy. The pork shoulder was tough, it does have a veru good smoky flavor and good grilled marks. I dont know why they grill such a tough cut though. It came with grit and I am not a big grit fan but this was delicious, very creamy and flavorful, almost like mash potato consistency. Parking wasn't particularly hard. Seating was very close so you can hear whatever people saying next to you. Definitely not kid family. It could get very noisy sometimes.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"We chose Russell House Tavern based on its proximity to the Loeb Theater. 12:45 reservation prior to a 2 pm show. Seated downstairs in a cozy (and comfortable) table. Told our server our show time, and she assured us we'd be out in plenty of time. I ordered the anti-Benedict, and he ordered the Nutella French toast. Each had a cocktail too. Clearly, she expedited our order as it came out in what seemed like 5 minutes. Nice!His French toast was fantastic. My anti-Benedict was very good. The server described it as a standard poached egg that is flash fried and still has a runny yoke. The yikes on mine were hard cooked. Still very tasty. Next tine I'd get the regular eggs Benedict. If that's the worst thing that happens, I'll call it a win. Great atmosphere, outstanding service and good food. That's a trifecta.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"On my reservation, I mentioned that I would be celebrating my sisters birthday and Russell House did a fantastic job of making it extra special. They called a few hours ahead of time to make sure we were all 21 and we didn't have any food allergies. Once we got there the wait staff surprised us with glasses of champagne on the House! My drink, The It's Always Sunny, was fantastic and the food was great! I got the steak frites, while the rest of my family got the grilled chicken and the 3 way pork. We were all well impressed with the food and selection. Finally they surprised us with dessert, which was fantastic!The atmosphere and ambiance was great as well. Really nice place to celebrate a special occasion as its busy but not too loud. Can't wait to come here again!",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"3,"Despite the popularity of Russell House Tavern, I had a fairly mediocre lunch with The Boy and his family. We all got a sandwich; I tried the Slow-Roasted ""Char Siu"" Pork Loin.I was hopeful and skeptic and my skeptic self was proven right. The pork was more dry loin than ""char siu"" and the hoison-ginger aioli didn't compensate for the usual sweet taste of ""char siu."" The peanuts were nice but the mint didn't mesh with the rest and to be honest the peanuts and mint were confusing as if it was Pad Thai instead of a ""char siu"" sandwich. This sandwich was doing too much and succeeded at very little. Fries that came on the side were the best part.Maybe I'll try again and give actual breakfast foods a shot or give dinner a whirl but I'm in no rush.",Russell House Tavern,"14 Jfk St Cambridge, MA 02138"5,"Went for drinks and dollar oysters. Got a Moonlit Stroll which was made with their special house made ginger beer. The drink was awesome!

Come early for brunch. Be prepared for a possible wait outside.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"3,"Delicious Turkish food, and kind staff. Vegetarian options, and lots of lamb dishes. I had the Green Lentil Plate, which is spiced lentils and lamb on top of pita, with a moderate dollop of yogurt. Would definitely go again. Drawbacks are few number of seats, and kitchen slightly slow. Best to call ahead when you're close, to make sure you can get seated.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,The food for dinner was delightful. A little on the more expensive end but for two people a soup (Paca) and a Turkish Hot tapa (Imam Bayildi) and an entree (Iskender Kofte) was more than enough and prepared very quickly. This restaurant serves traditional Turkish food and the vibe and atmosphere inside is lovely. Would definitely love to come back to try the breakfast!,Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"I use to live around the corner from this place and never thought growing up in Somerville a Turkish restaurant would open up in my old neighborhood. It was mostly Italian, Chinese, and a bunch of pizza shops. Places have transformed in this area in the past years and for teele square this is a great addition ! Now let's talk about my first Turkish experience, and yes thank you to my fellow yelpers your reviews led us to this unique place and it didn't disappoint at all. Location next to a pub, street parking only and you have to pay unless it's Sunday, Â so good luck with that. Inside is very small I would say about 10 tables some cool art work on the wall but still simple, if it's busy expect a wait but there was no one in here on a Sunday at 1pm which was perfect cause I hate sitting in small places next to people so we were all alone. Service was slow it was two ladies just sitting there talking nonsense as we were waiting to order, like HELLO I am hungry. We finally ordered and than received fresh warm bread with some type of red dipping sauce, should have gotten the name but it was delightful! Brunch was still going on so I got the omellte with Turkish sausage. It was served in a skillet and seems that's what was used to make it in. It was delicious and so different, the spices were something I never had before and the meat was tender. The cheese rolls was good but the way they Â served it was wrong, it was just a pile of phyllo dough, cheese and just sloppy, poor presentation. Overall good experience and will be back to try more good stuff",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"I've never came here for lunch or dinner, it was always for breakfast because it's my absolute favorite! Their breakfast is very fresh and tasty. My go to is their Turkish plate (I believe that's what it's called). It comes with a variety of good items. Instead of their boiled eggs, I requested scrambled and it was literally the best scrambled eggs I've ever had.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"3,"This place came highly recommended to me, and I was excited to check it out. Now it's a little unfortunate that when a place like that gets a lot of hype, the expectations are raised very high. This sets it up for failure from the start. Kind of like in life you have to keep your expectations for things very low because then you'll be happy more often (when your expectations are exceeded). This is one of the keys to happiness, according to my mentor.But anyways, Istanbul'lu was ok. I got a meat plate which had meat, rice, and some grilled peppers. All were ok. I remember it feeling like a pretty healthy meal too. But didn't stand our very much. I think that the meat did have some complex spices in it which were pretty unique, but otherwise it wasn't too juicy. Not too many vegetables on the plate either. And I remember that it was kind of pricy for this kind of plate.Overall, yes, it got hyped up to me, but I think it wasn't really to my taste. I'll try and give it another shot and try something else.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"I came here with my two sisters and a friend during Labor Day weekend. 2 main reasons for coming here for dinner:-Halal -I was craving Turkish food (last time I had it was back in NY during my office holiday gathering ) Since I'm not very well versed with the Turkish cuisine, I ordered what I liked from my previous experience at the holiday gathering. I ordered the sigara borek (filo cheese dough something something) and the Pizara (lamb chops). Please forgive me since I might be butchering the spelling of these dishes, but my pics speak a thousand words , so hopefully it shouldn't allude confusion. Anyways, let's talk food:-Not so much a fan of their filo rolls. It was very bland imo. It felt like bad mozzarella sticks. -The lamb chops really make up for the bad filo rolls. Very tender and juicy. The rice was also amazing too! The lamb chop portions are small but that's the case with most Turkish places I've been to. I'd pair it with an appetizer (not filo rolls) to make it a full meal. The ambience is very nice and calm (bathroom is pretty and clean so that's a plus for me) It's a small restaurant in the Somerville area and I noticed it attracts a lot of students. My sis mentioned that it gets packed during most weekdays, but I guess we got lucky. Quality wise, I say this place is overall pretty good (still prefer NY Turkish food). Price wise, it was comparative to the Turkish restaurants in New York. My sis's good buddy paid the bill for us, which was so sweet! But if you don't have an amazing buddy, do carry lots of dough (not filo dough though. Hehee....)",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Small, cozy, tasty. I had heard good things about Istanbul'lu, and it definitely fulfilled my expectations. The restaurant is very small and casual, so it is probably hard to get a table during peak hours. Service was warm, friendly, and provided great recommendations. The brunch platter was a great dish to share with lots of sweet and savory goodies. I also tried some grape leaves, some eggplant, and a lamb dish with white beans. Everything was very satisfying and I can't wait to return to try more. Baklava, almond pudding, and some Turkish tea was the perfect way to end the meal. Recommended!",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"3,"Really expensive for food you get, if you doing vegetarian options. But delicious. Same with coffee and tea.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"A favorite of mine for brunch, dinner and/or dessert. I would even go for breakfast, Â who am I kidding?

Their menu is little bit pricy. Our waitress was very nice.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"We tried this place on a Saturday night. Obviously, we had made reservations in advance. The restaurant itself is very small ( I think, 15-20 seater max) and the ambiance is average (they can definitely do better in this area). You can get 2 hour parking spots around the restaurant very easily. There are several vegetarian Tapas options. We tried their -1. Hummus (comes with a couple of olives on top and is silky smooth texture wise), 2. cheesy spinach- has a very cremy texture 3. yoghurt tomato-y eggplant - seemed like the eggplant was slow cooked. The pieces were intact, juicy and tasted delicious with the yoghurt.4. filo pastry rolls (5)- these could use some sort of chutney /dip and 5. feta cheese cubes (4 in total) wrapped with slices of red bell peppers- this dish had maple syrup drizzling on top which made the dish taste sweet and salty at the same time..delicious overall.Their lamb entre was good but very highly priced. They serve bread and a bell pepper dip at the beginning...these two are delicious! The bread is soft, warm and super fresh. They serve unlimited bread upon request. They have a small selection of wines. I plan to try their desserts next time around! Overall, this is a great, cosy restaurant.. Great for small parties of 4-6 people or a small family. I wish they had more vegetarian entre options..not a fan of grilled / sautÃ©d vegetables. The food is true to it's ingredients, simple and delicious! If you haven't tried Turkish cuisine before (like me), this is probably is great place to start with!",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,The most delicious Turkish food! The food is very taste for a good price. I really recommend this place.,Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,This is second time here it gets better and better Fantastic Turkish Food and Turk l dont like every Turkish restaurant in state but this place is realy good,Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"1,"Where to start? Â My friend asked for an iced tea. Â They said they were ""out of iced tea"", yet hot tea was on the menu. Â I asked whether we might just order a hot tea, and some ice. Â The server, with a snotty attitude, replied that they couldn't do anything that was ""off the menu"". Â We should have left at that point. Â I ordered the yogurt ""salad"" for $9, which turned out to be, literally, a cup of yogurt with oil drizzled on top (this was not mentioned in the description) with a so little shredded cucumber in it that you could scarcely taste it, and no spices to speak of. Â This was a ""salad""??? Â By the time I finished trying to scoop out the oil (who wants worthless calories), there was little left. Â And seriously??? Â NINE dollars for a cup of yogurt??? Â This could win the price for the most over-priced item I have *ever* ordered in a restaurant.Next up was the chicken kebab, at $18. Â It was billed as ""chicken and vegetables"". Â  Â The chicken arrive- a grilled chicken breast, quite tasty. Â But the ""vegetables""? Â Literally a quarter of a tomato, sliced in half, and 2 small narrow strips of some kind of green pepper. Â Nothing more than a garnish. Â Seriously??? Â $18???? No one ever attended to our table. Â I had to ask twice to get water refilled. Â Bottom line: Â nice atmosphere, nasty servers, ridiculous prices, small portions, inaccurate menu descriptions. Â With so many wonderful-looking restaurants in Davis Square, I don't know how these people stay in business.I left $30 poorer, and hungry.Never again.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"2,"If you want to visit a Teele square restaurant then be forewarned: most of them are closed for lunch. Most days you will be SOL if you plan to get lunch food at Istanbul'lu as well, but they actually open early on Thursdays, and Fridays. I got lucky, because otherwise I would have just been a hungry dude, roaming the streets of Somerville like a zombie in search of GRAIIIINNNS!Eating at any cultural restaurant is always a fun test of your pronunciation of unfamiliar words, or as I like to call it, ""Spot the American,"" and this place is no exception. There are a lot of options even on their lunch menu, but you picked the wrong place for vegan, or vegetarian food.She ordered a grape leaves sandwich, and I ordered a lamb, and rice plate. The appetizer bread was freaking delicious, and came with a dip that I wish that I knew how to recreate. The bread is also as unlimited as a small, independent restaurant can reasonably offer, so we got plenty of that.The grape leaves sandwich were a disappointment, because the restaurant cut out all of the ingredients that were not vegan. Consequently we just got four grape leaf rolls on a plate, and they called it a day. I hoped that they might make some substitution rather than just serving less food, but no dice.The lamb plate was tasty, but light on substance. It was mostly rice, and yogurt with a few strips of lamb, and potato to mix in. Once mixed, it was more like a stir fry. I repeat: it was tasty, but there was a lot of rice, yogurt and just not enough of the named ingredients.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,We went there for a lunch the other day.We ordered lots of appetizers.They were so delicious.Nice Turkish cuisine.Parking a bit hard but we found it on the street.,Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"/ BOTTOM LINE:Tucked among a series of restaurants near Teele Square, it's really easy to miss Istanbul'lu. But once you find it you'll find a warm cozy restaurant with some amazing Turkish cuisine, most of which I haven't had and welcoming service./ THE SPACE:It's small: most of the tables are for two, and it can probably seat up to 30 people. We've never had to wait for a spot, but it seems quite busy for brunch around noon./ THE FOOD:They start you off with warm bread and roasted red pepper dip, and they are not stingy with the bread! It's important to keep the bread coming for the dishes you'll order, as you'll have a ton of hummus, yogurt, etc., to sop up with it for your main dishes.The menu is broken up into hot and cold tapas, and entrees. There were a lot of unfamiliar terms to me but the explanations on the menu are great (as was google) and the service was really helpful. For brunch, there are sandwiches and salads available.For appetizers, we've had:DOLMA - stuffed grape leaves. Light and delicious, with fresh yogurt.HAYDARI - fresh Turkish yogurt with garlic melted butter -- oozy, pungent, and thick. Fantastic with bread.HUMMUS - also thick and rich. We got too full eating this with all the other dips we have, but if you want fresh hummus this is the place to get it.For mains, we've had:KURU FASUYLE - white beans with tomatoes and lamb. It was delicious and fulfilling, like a home cooked stew. Came with a generous helping of rice -- all for around $10 during lunch!LAZ PANCAKES - for brunch - Turkish pancakes topped with honey, cheese, and jam. SO hearty and rich -- it read more like a dense doughey cake than anything else. I would recommend sharing this.Instabul'lu is sucha wonderful establishment for filling home cooking. We leave satisfied but never feeling gross, and eager to try the many other dishes on the menu.",Istanbulu,"237 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Highly recommend. I love coming to Five Horses when the weather is nice, sitting outside, and watching the people walk by. They are always able to accommodate my dog (when the outdoor seating is up and running) and even bring her a little water bowl! The beers are good here - I'm especially a fan of their Sour Beer week - and the food has been consistently good. I always get the cornbread when I go - do yourself a favor and just order it. It comes in it's own cast iron skillet with a big glob of butter. I'm getting hungry as I write this, thinking about the cornbread. I also enjoy the loaded tots when someone at my table orders them, but I never actually order them for myself. Having been here more than a few times I've had the opportunity to peruse quite a bit of the menu and, in general, I enjoy the food. My go to is the fried chicken salad - it makes me feel like I'm making good choices after all the cornbread I just ate! I also like their tacos. I recently had the special taste of Somerville taco and I really hope it makes it on to the official menu at some point! My final recommendation is, if you're looking for a side, the cheesy mashed potatoes. They are quite yum. Overall 4-4.5 consistently and will return.",Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"2,"Becca:Came here for a friend's birthday brunch with a relatively large group of girls (5-7?). I was excited to check out this place in Davis Square and was starving for some good brunch. Â We all ordered the mimosa flight which came at a hefty price tag ($18) for four small ~ 3 sip glasses of mimosa. Â Granted, it's my fault for getting a mimosa at a place that boasts its excellent beer selection, but it was all in the spirit of Sunday gals brunch! Â The flavors were interesting and delicious--guava, orange, blackberry, and grapefruit--but definitely not worth the cost.Brunch menu items were the usual suspects with some interesting options, but I opted for ""The Tavern Breakfast"", aka 2 eggs your way, potatoes, and toast because...who could mess that up!? Well, my ""two eggs over-easy with well-done potatoes and rye toast with butter"" came out as two eggs over-hard with cold, mushy potatoes and dry whole wheat toast. The very small portions on the plate looked unappetizing-- two pale eggs (cooked incorrectly), soggy potatoes in a tiny ramekin, and two pieces of toast all for $13. Â There were no condiments on the table and we asked for ketchup and butter three times but did not get it until the end of the meal, which was unfortunate. Â It was incredibly bland and, though I never waste any food, I found myself having a hard time trying to finish this small breakfast plate. Â Overall it was a 1/5 meal.Other girls got the ""Rise and Shine"" brunch pizza and Chimichanga which looked pretty good. Â The Breaky Sammie was doused in butter but seemed to be better portioned that the other options. One of the girls didn't get her meal until 20 minutes after we all got ours because they forgot her order which, hey it happens!, but definitely added to the overall unpleasant experience. Based on other reviews, I'm sure this place does a better job with their lunch selections and beer options but I just wasn't happy with the service or my food and unfortunately will not be back.",Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"3,"Thought to try this on World Cup Sunday - fun to watch the game with a crew. Also wanted to try the brunch. Made reservations in advance but not really necessary (even for a Sunday).The brunch menu seem to have Latin dishes (think beans & tacos with an eastern (Japanese) influence. Fried chicken seems to be very popular too. I wanted a classic brunch meal, so went with the 'good morning Davis ' dish, a 3-egg omelette with mushrooms, spinach, roasted red peppers and cheddar cheese. I loved the roasted peppers, but was overwhelmed with the cheese (a little too much, and was overpowering everything else). A little too oily too. The portion was really large and filing. Good I was hungry.I particularly liked the cold brew coffee - not too bitter and quite smooth. I wasn't very tempted by the choices of mimosas in the mimosa flight, but did order a grapefruit mimosa at the end of my meal (quite fresh!!). Most servers are friendly and accommodating. I wasn't rushed out of my table nor interrupted much ... after all, it was World Cup Sunday :) A little too noisy, but no more than any other bar.

The beer options are very good and came cold, could be cheaper but hey, its somerville. The food is creative and comforting but the mix of cuisines is confusing. They try and tackle everything from tex-mex to southeast asian to french to american. Some thing are great and others kind of whiff. The burger and fried chicken sandwiches are usually crowd pleasers. Overall, you wont go wrong at this place but you may feel like it could have been better",Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"3,"I really want to give Five Horses Tavern more than three stars, because I love the vibe here and the truly unbeatable beer list - but the food experiences we've had have been unfortunately inconsistent.Let's start with the positives - anything here involving chicken (in particular, their FRIED chicken) is usually quite reliable. I still have dreams about the time I ordered the fried chicken sammy here and made the glorious decision to ask for extra honey on the side... it was beyond decadent. On my last visit here, I ordered the French Kiss pizza (apple, brie, candied walnuts, arugula puree, and balsamic glaze), and I would absolutely get that again too.The service here is also very friendly, and I really can't think of a bad waiter or waitress that I've had over the ten or so times I've visited. And the location is perfect - we used to live literally next door to this place, so it became a decent option when folks from out-of-town were visiting and we wanted to go someplace with a sizable-enough menu and a laidback-but-still classy vibe. What keeps this place from being more highly rated for me is that we have had enough 'meh' food experiences here (which is a bummer when the cost isn't dirt-cheap either...) to keep us from being fully-converted Five Horses enthusiasts. Most of the the things that we weren't as impressed with have since been taken off the menu (which I suppose is a good sign...), but one thing that we were particularly disappointed with recently was that they seemed to have changed their roasted chicken recipe! It used to be this magnificent, extra-crunchy delight that took about 20 minutes to prepare (it was worth the wait though!), but upon our last return, the roasted chicken was not the same menu item at all, and upon ordering it, the quality was definitely a big step down from the way they used to serve it.This is one of those places where, if the entrees were each a couple bucks cheaper, I might be more forgiving, but if I'm going to spend close to $20 on some roasted chicken, I want it to be better than average.We'll continue to come back, since a good amount of the food has indeed been tasty, but we're definitely starting to keep track of what menu items we would and wouldn't order again.",Five Horses Tavern,"400 Highland Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,Love this place!

Â We ordered our food, which arrived fairly quickly (both burgers) and quite enjoyed them. Â They are HUGE and always cooked the way you ordered them. After that, the only interaction we had with the staff was someone giving us our bill and removing our plates and glasses from the table.

We got the house special for 3 people (which means an extra half of a lobster tail, an extra lobster claw, and more seafood for $30 extra instead of $10 for an additional plate but same amount of food). The portions are big so if you're not a starving tourist than I'm sure that $10 plate would have sufficed. To me, it seems that the philosophy of Giacomo's is the food will keep bringing you back.

When can I go back? Can anyone share the recipe or do a copycat recipe? MUST HAVE. Hands down, best meal I had in Boston. It was FREEZING cold in Boston, and being a Cali-girl, I was definitely not used to snow and face-numbing weather. I really wanted something delicious that would warm my heart and my stomach on my very last day in Boston and I absolutely knew that I had to eat at Giacomo's. My coworkers back home told me about their sauce and how it was probably the best pasta they've ever had. If they're making these claims, how can you not give this place a try?When you arrive, you'll notice quite a long line outside the restaurant. You can't put your name down and you can't wait inside. So the fact that it's freezing cold outside, a 1 hour to 2 hour wait just does not seem ideal. But, everyone leaving the restaurant told me it was absolutely worth it so we just had to suck it up and wait. The restaurant isn't too big on the inside, maybe 10-12 small tables that shift around for larger parties. For two people, we waited about an hour or so, just because the larger parties in front of us weren't ready and they could only fit two anyways. The menu is very straightforward and is organized by the type of pasta you want.Here's the run down:Choose from Linguine, Fettuccini, Ziti, Ravioli.If you choose Linguine, you can pick the type of seafood you want with it: mussels, calamari, clams, scallops, shrimp and even lobster (if they have it). We ended up ordering the special which came with half a lobster tail, clams and mussels over linguine and your choice of sauce for $22. WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. Now comes the sauce, Pesto, Red, Fra Diabolo, Giacomo, Fracomo and Scampi. We tried the Red because that was my coworker's recommendation. Then we ordered a separate order of mussels with Giacomo because we wanted to try the sauce. If a sauce is named after the restaurant, then it must be delicious!The servers here are so sweet. It might seem like they're very straight to the point, but I think they really take their time to make sure you're enjoying yourself. It can feel cramped, but it's because they're trying to sit as many parties as they can. Service was great when I went. They brought us warm buttery garlic bread, and even extra bread when we wanted it to soak up the sauce. He also gave us extra plates and extra napkins because we really looked like we needed it. We were stuffing our faces endlessly. I'm honestly so happy that I was able to eat here and I am looking forward to the day that I return to Giacomo's once again.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Lived up to the hype! We arrived on July 4th at 5PM and miracle of miracles - were sat in the last available table. Service is fast and friendly and the menus are written on chalk boards or handwritten pieces of paper. Essentially you choose your preferred seafood or meat and sauce and voila, there's your dinner. The seafood feasts ($60) looked phenomenal but we opted for the lobster and shrimp special with fra diavolo (spicy red) sauce that was half the price. Got the fresh lobster fix I was craving! The seafood is fresh, the homemade fusili soaked up the sauce perfectly, and even after all the food was gone, I found myself continuing to finish the sauce with the bread and even a spoon. Bottles of wine are $20 - how can you say no to that?

Our waitress got us drinks and appetizers right away and we look at the board for the specials. I was very tempted to get the grilled chicken special but opted for one of their popular dishes.The Butternut squash ravioli was to die for. I never had anything that amazing it was very mouth watering and topped with fresh parmesan. I pretty much licked my plate clean and used left over bread to eat up all the sauce. The only thing I was not prepared for was the cash only good thing my friend was able to help me out and pay. Afterward we walked across the street to get some fresh italian desserts.

We only ended up waiting about 20-30 minuets, but EVERYONE that came out of the restaurant said it was worth the wait. When we were seated, it definitely had the vibe of an Italian family's kitchen, prepping for Sunday dinner. It's a very small seating area, but I feel like it makes it that much more special (and feels like you're at home). We ordered the calamari (not pictured) and it was probably the best calamari of my life. It melts right in your mouth-I even ate the ones with the tentacles because they were so good. I personally ordered the fettuccine with prosciutto and peas in a garlic cream sauce, and it was SPECTACULAR. It was the closest thing to an Alfredo sauce on the menu, and I would definitely order it again. My dinner guests ordered clams in a scampi sauce, and lobster in the Giacomo sauce. Both were also good.If you're in the area, I definitely recommend it. Do not let the wait turn you off-it's totally worth it, and moves quickly.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Waited 1.5 hours in line starting at 4:55pm (25 min after opening) on a Saturday evening. I would say the food is worth the wait. I think the wait is so long due to the size of the place...very small. This place is real and authentic Italian. You can tell the people that work there are Italian, the vibe is rushed, and the atmosphere is loud. I recommend the lobster ravioli...sooo good! But you really can't go wrong with anything.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"1,"The service here is TERRIBLE. I can NEVER go back here. I came with 2 friends, and one of them was visiting from out of town, so I though this would be a great place to go since i've heard good things from other people. The way it works here is that you basically wait in line outside the restaurant til you get a table inside this small restaurant. The meal started out alright our waitress took our orders and then it went downhill from there. Â She got progressievly ruder throughout the meal, was not attentive to refill our water, did not ask how our meal was going and just stopped showing up. This is, like many places around the north end, a cash only business and we were all aware of that yet we only had a few $20 bills on us. When the bill came we asked if we could get change before paying, and the waitress so rudely said ""I don't have change for that much money"" first of all our bill was less than $100 and secondly, this place is cash only, how do you not have enough cash?? She then proceeded, in her rude tone, to say that she can only give change for 1 of our $20 bills. sure, whatever. At this point of the night my entire party was very mad with the way she had been acting, so like any normal person, we left a poor tip. I know servers make most of their wages this way, but you can't treat us like this and expect at least a decent tip. We proceeded to get up to leave the restuarant, and we had not even left our table before our waitress came back, counted the tip infront of us, and scold us for not leaving enough. We were so heated and then proceeded to say we didnt have enough cash and then she had the audacity to say ""I know you have money, I gave you change"" as she was referring to that 1 $20 bill. I had never been so attacked for eating at a restaurant. While the food may have been good, it's definitely not worth the terrible service, I will surely never return to to this establishment.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Can't count the number of times I get asked the following whenever I am on line waiting for Giacomo's: Is it really THAT good? Is it worth the wait? Are you crazy?!.... yes, it is THAT good. yes, it's worth it so shut up and just get to the back of the line already. And YES call me crazy cause I love Giacomo's! Â I keep on coming back here because the food here is superb and the prices are fairly reasonable. The calamari is undoubtedly THE best calamari I have ever tried. Fried to perfection, they add in fried peppers so that the dish has a nice spice/kick to it. I highly recommend the lobster ravioli--the sauce is so velvety and super flavorful and they are really generous with the lobster. You also can't go wrong with their linguine where you get to select your choice of seafood(s) and a sauce that satisfies your palate. Â I can see why many people might have hesitations on coming here because of the long wait, cramped space, and quick turn-around of customers, but Giacomo's isn't deemed a North end staple for no good reason!! So trust me, come to Giacomo's because the food will speak for itself and put your initial doubts to shame.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"We got to the north end early and decided to walk up and down the main street. We saw a huge line for this place and looked it up on yelp to see an amazing amount of great reviews. Is it possible this place is all hype? Would waiting in line be worth it? 100% it was definitely worth it and then some. We got in line at around 6:45 PM. The three of us were seated at 7:30 PM on a cool summer night. It's classic Italian affair. Portions are on the large size but not huge. Prices were very reasonable. We started with the Caesar salad for two. It easily could have fed for. It was crisp Romain lettuce, garlicky Caesar dressing, their homemade Italian bread made into croutons and Parmesan cheese perfect it was delicious. The food comes out really fast! We had garlic bread which was the best we've ever had in our lives. We had fried calamari, veal Parmesan with a side of spaghetti marinara And lastly linguine with White clam sauce. Our drinks were a Peroni beer and a glass of Chianti. The bill came to $76! It was more than enough food and we took some home. We even asked for an extra order of garlic bread to take home. I highly recommend coming to Giacomo's!",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Come here, but make reservations. This place, and many of the Italian eateries in the North End, are tiny, and if you're not prepared, you can wait over an hour. This seems to be standard practice in these family owned establishments - no name taking, no beepers, no text confirmations - if you want to eat at Giacomo's, you wait your turn in line out on the sidewalk.After a midday Saturday Sox game, we trekked home to the North End, and we were starving. I called ahead trying to make a last minute reservation, but it didn't work. I was told the wait was about 25 minutes. When we arrived, the line of about 20 people was completely daunting. As we explored other options, we realized that given it was the peak dinner time, in one of the hottest neighborhoods, on a beautiful Saturday night - we would be waiting no matter where we ate. Our party of two split up. I waited at Giacomo's and my friend stood at another restaurant. We decided whoever sat first, that's where we'd eat. After about 40 minutes, we got to skip ahead of larger parties and snag a table for two. If you're coming here with more than two people in your party - DEFINITELY make reservations, or you could be waiting over an hour.We sat at a table with another couple. Good thing they were friendly - that woulda been awkward! Lots of yummy things on the menu, but after seeing our table mates order the Fried Calamari and Burrata appetizer special, we decided to follow suit. Since we ordered two appetizers, we decided to split an entrÃ©e. There's good variety of pasta, sauces, and proteins, especially seafood. And the prices are amazing! $15 for Shrimp Scampi? Yes. We split the dish, and I'm glad we did. After the two appetizers, some AMAZING warm bread (on the house), the perfect portion of Shrimp Scampi left us happy and satiated, but not uncomfortably stuffed (my usual state when departing an Italian place.) The food was made quick and fresh to order. The service was quick, efficient, and friendly, especially given the tight space and crowds they deal with. The restaurant was stuffy and loud, but my water glass was never empty. (If you're claustrophobic, look for a different place to eat) The scampi was fresh, light, and savory, and the Burrata and Calamari was flavorful. We ordered a small order of Calamari, and it was a heaping platter. I can't imagine what a large is meant to feed. It was the perfect amount of food. My only regret is not wearing a bib. I've decided I'm not allowed to order Scampi anymore without one - I always get butter down the front of me!Overall, GREAT value and amazing prices for what you get. Just do yourself a favor and make a reservation. Additionally, I'd avoid driving here at ALL costs, especially on a weekend. Public transport is your best friend in this neighborhood.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"3,"Tasty north end staple!I went last night with a friend and we ordered ziti, chicken parm, and a burrata.1) the bread was fine but nothing special. They have olive oil and balsamic which you can adjust to your taste. Â 2/5 2) personally love burrata and enjoyed the cheese with fresh tomatoes. 4/53) I had a glass of wine. Well priced at $6 a glass but served in a warm glass fresh from dishwasher. 2/54) chicken parm- good crusting and served with fresh pasta and flavorful but balanced sauce- 4/55) ziti- I just tried a bite but it was tasty and pasta was the perfect texture. Â 3/5May have just been the weather ( about to rain on a warm June evening) but between being packed and sitting right by the kitchen it was very very hot. Ambiance is nice other than that. It is a great place to go to enjoy good food but not necessarily a date or special occasion. You may be placed at a joined table. This was fine for us, and I appreciate them moving the line efficiently as possible but worth noting. If a tourist - can have someone wait in line and grab mike's pastry across the street for after. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Also very accommodating to a seafood allergy. *tip- go on a Monday- at 6:45 we were told 45 minutes but it was only 20 for a table of 2. Remember- bring cash!",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Amazing Italian restaurant that makes you feel like you are in eating at a family owned restaurant in Italy. Cash only restaurant so make sure to bring plenty. They give very healthy portions, so be prepared to eat! I ate so much that as soon as we got back to our hotel I passed out from a food coma. I was so stuffed, but couldn't stop because it was so good! Fried Calamari - the perfect amount of crispy and soft. We got the small size and it was more than enough between two people. Lobster Ravioli - good amount of lobster in each pasta and it went extremely well with the sauce. Each bite was just absolute heaven. Â Fruitti di mare - amazing seafood linguine. Very generous portions of shrimp, scallops, calamari, clams and mussels.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Perhaps the hype has died down a little, or because it's a weekday, I was pleasantly surprised that there was no need to wait for a table even at prime dinner time!There are two must-get items whenever I go to Giacomo's, their fried calamari and the mussels appetizer! The small fried calamari here is probably the equivalent of a large at other places, it was definitely more than enough for two people, as we had some leftovers to take home! The fried calamari has includes some fried peppers too, which gives it a nice sour/spicy kick every few bites. The calamari is always fried perfectly, the breading is always crispy and the calamari itself has a tender bite. Â Just found out today that there's a sauce for the mussels that isn't listed on the menu: spicy lobster sauce! It is a slightly spicy tomato-based red sauce that has seafood flavor. No surprise that it went well with the mussels, that were very fresh and well cooked. Other sauces that are good include red sauce and the diavolo sauce. I usually get one of the seafood pastas as my entrÃ©e, and the seafood has always been very fresh, and I really like the red sauce! Tried the special for the first time today: pepper pasta with baby shrimp, spinach, mussels with a creamy mushroom sauce. There was a very smoky flavor to it which reminded me of bacon or smoked foods. The mussels in the pasta dish was a lot saltier and smokier, which makes me think that it was smoked. While I liked how this dish tasted, I probably will not be getting it again because it is heavy/creamy dish, and I was struggling to eat it after the first couple of bites. For dessert, our server strongly recommended the fried apple cheesecake. But I decided to get the tiramisu instead. Besides being a little too sweet for my liking, the tiramisu was delicious! It was also very suitable for takeout, which I did because I was so full from dinner but still wanted dessert. It has a substantial amount of coffee flavor, and you can tell that the cream contained cheese and not just whipped cream.Our server was very friendly and attentive, and she also gave recommendations! Great service overall!",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,"We LOVE this place. Both times that we have been here, we have waited over an hour and it has always been worth the wait. It is our favorite Italian restaurant in Boston and for good reason! The restaurant starts by giving you bread. This is probably the only disappointing part of the meal because it is cold and I always expect the bread to come out piping hot from the oven but it does its job especially if you've been waiting over an hour to get into the restaurant. For an appetizer, we ordered the calamari. Sprinkle some lemon juice and dip it into the sauce and it is absolutely delectable. I absolutely love the mussel and clams linguine with the spicy lobster sauce. My husband got the shrimp and scallop linguine with the scampi sauce. Both were absolutely amazing! By the time you're done with an appetizer and an entree you basically don't have room for dessert because of their large portions. I'm dying to try the seafood special for two so we are definitely going to be making another trek here to try out that dish. The wait is WORTH IT! It is very easily the best Italian food that you will have and for very decent prices! Yum, love this place, you definitely have to check this place out! Just remember that it is CASH ONLY.",Giacomo's Ristorante,"355 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"5,Visiting Boston is not complete without this restaurant. OMG!!!!

Waiting times are usually manageable even during busy periods because the restaurant has plenty of seating space. Furthermore, the staff is friendly and service is on point across the board.

Loved the meal and the environment.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"2,"It wasn't our first choice, but we were in a rush and the place we initially wanted to eat had a wait. Therefore we settled for Legal. The food was average at best but when you combine that with bloated prices, that exacerbates the whole situation. I admittedly didn't help the situation by making a poor order choice of seafood au gratin. The seafood was over cooked and just sitting in a pool of butter. And I know that an au gratin is generally an oil heavy dish. But this was way over-the-top.My friend also tried to get a tuna burger, and they said they could only serve it well-done because of health safety. Clearly they weren't using quality tuna. I will say the service and drinks were solid though. But at the end of the day, there's many better options to eat in Assembly Row.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"3,"We came here for dinner on MLK Day because Legal Seafoods had ""$1 Chowda Day"" at all of their locations. Perfect enticement on a balmy 18 degrees night, and any little excuse to not have to cook was alright by me. I had requested a booth when I made the reservation on OpenTable, the host acknowledged the request, but unfortunately none was available. Booths are across their open kitchen and I wanted the heat coming from that kitchen. However, he was kind enough to sit us underneath a heating lamp (yes we were inside, but it was 18 degrees outside and any extra heat they could give me was better than plain heat).The one dollar clam chowder was steaming hot, but lacked some clams. For a buck, I couldn't complain. Then we had whole-bellied fried clams. Usually they're perfect, but they were a bit salty that night. My husband ordered the Bouillabaisse. Usually it's prefect, but he said the broth was too salty that night. I had Grilled Rainbow Trout. Again, not wanting to sound like a broken record....usually perfect, but a tad too salty that night. It was apparent the cooks were salt-sprinkly-too-happy that night. My Ginger Martinis were the highlight of the evening. Kudos to the bartender who made them for me. Strongest drinks I've ever had in my life. It made the room so much warmer, and my salty trout way more eatable.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"4,"The Assembly Square area is chock full of new restaurants and shops, so it's a given that Legal Seafood would open an outpost here facing the Mystic River. Â We stopped in for lunch after catching a matinÃ©e at the AMC around the corner and there were plenty of tables to accommodate us without a reservation. Â The open space with an island bar in the middle and open kitchen towards the back looked semi-industrial, I'm guessing is a throwback to the roots of the area.When you're in Boston at Legal, Clam Chowder is a no brainer. Â Get a mug for everybody, because I hate sharing my soup. Â They have whole belly fried clams also, so gotta get that. Â They're a little on the small side but good, nonetheless. Â Might as well round out the appetizers with scallops and baked oysters and skip the entree for me. Â Around the table we also had the seared salmon tacos for my wife which came with a side of red beans and rice. Â My son was very satisfied with his scallops au gratin special of the day.

Â You can always depend on Legal for fresh seafood and a great dining experience.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"3,"I was very curious to try this Legal Seafood location. I went with my family on a Friday night and it was quiet busy. There was seating by the windows, bar, middle dining and outdoor area. Luckly I made a reservation on OpenTable and requested for a window seat. We were seated immediately upon arrival. Our server was really nice and was able to recommend some great options for us to try. For drinks we got the Sex on The Beach Sangria, Santa Margarita and a half bottle of wine. The cocktails, recommended by the waiter, quite delicious and a good portion was given for the sangria. We started off with the Legal's Signature crab cake, New England clam chowder and 6 of two different types of raw oysters. They were all delicious! Only thing was the crab cake was a portion for two instead of three people. We ordered the seafood lover pizza, Shrimp Fusilli, and Seafood Au Gratin with a ""premium"" side of asparagus for the main entrees. I was not a huge fan of the seafood lover pizza. I guess I couldn't expect much, but it was not loaded with seafood and it has mostly cheese. The shrimp fusilli and seatood au grain were very good. We would definitely order that or recommend that if you want a pasta dish or seafood casserole with a side. Our waiter was pretty busy and came by occasionally. The reason why I am not giving it 4 stars is because there were multiple flies and fruit flies all over our table (see photo). We sat by the window near the river side and we noticed that they left the main door open. Flies almost got into the food, but one sat on the straw of our drink. Luckly I had caught it and showed it to the waiter, but just replaced our straw. I mentioned it to the waiter initially and the manager after the bill was. Neither person didn't really do anything about it, which I sort of understand because it's not like they can be catching flies or something. However, the manager noted that the windows normally open up and today they were closed. If anything I think they should have at least opened the windows the let them go since it was pretty windy outside. Even though I did enjoy the place and most of the food, I wish they were sanitary in regards to the insects hovering our table.

It was gross. His entired bare hands touched the veggies. I saw his hands touching the cashier machine, shaking hands with his employees and etc. He did not used any food gloves. He definitely passed some germs on those veggies. I really hope those poor customer will not encounter any food poisoning. Anyways, after a few minutes of observing him, the manager came by his area and I noticed he quickly grabbed gloves and placed them on.I will not be coming back. It was disgusting.

Let me start by saying that I have drinks here at the bar all the time and I have been a loyal customer and always enjoyed being here. My friend and I arrived for a nice dinner after a long day. We ordered our food (shrimp fusilli, bang bang cauliflower, and swordfish tacos) with two drinks. We also ordered one shrimp fusilli with linguini instead of the fusilli to go for the end of our dinner. The waitress, Margaret, said she would check to see if they could even do linguini. Towards the end of our dinner, we had assumed everything was okay and she came over the a bag then stated she forgot to tell them about the linguini option. She went on to say I hope it's okay but I threw in some extra rolls. There was no option given. At first we said okay...I think it should be fine but my friends bf that we ordered for really didn't like fusilli and stated please change it for the linguini. We asked Margaret and she discussed it with her manager. Her response when arriving back was that the fusilli is freshly made at their location but the linguini hasn't been served here for over 9 months. THIS WAS A COMPLETE LIE DUE TO THE SIMPLE FACT THAT MY FRIEND'S BF HAD IT TWO WEEKS AGO FOR HER BIRTHDAY. We stated that to Margaret and she kept saying she understands and really believes us. She kindly* suggested that we ate it instead of him and use it for left over--- how sweeeet of her. I just need to state that this pasta dish is $25 dollars. We told her that it wasn't for us and it was for someone else and she kept asking if we were all set? How can we be all set when we are discussing the options she didn't leave us. I'm not sure if what she told her manager was the truth. At the end we decided to not take the food to go but got the same dish somewhere else for way less. All in all, this situation doesn't seem that negative, however it was presented to us as if we had been in the wrong. Even though we had clearly stated our preferences from the beginning. They made us feel like we were being difficult and had us leaving the restaurant not wanting to return. Don't get me wrong the food itself was terrific and so were the drinks. I just wish we weren't handled like some old Asian women trying to get a discount.",Legal on the Mystic,"301 Great River Rd Somerville, MA 02145"5,Such a perfect way to spend a hot afternoon! Staff member Kira gave such amazing recommendations and was endlessly funny and welcoming :) will definitely be back! Oh my gosh and Ethan put together the most BEAUTIFUL charcuterie board for us Â what a wonderful guy,American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"3,"Went on 4th of July and it was quiet. At first there was only one bartender, but again it was quiet. She was lackadaisical and Â quite disinterested in helping people. It took me about 10 minutes get a drink and the only reason I was able to order my food after 20 minutes of waiting, was because another bartender came in to take over half the bar. He saved this experience from 2 stars. Â I noticed that other patrons waited a long time for service also. Hate to be there when it's busy!!The beer was good, the turkey sandwich was good but the fries while nicely prepared, had so much salt that they were inedible. Not impressed but everyone is entitled to a bad day so maybe I'd give it one more try.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"4,"This is a pleasant surprise inside what looks like a pile of leftover construction crates. We went on a Saturday evening and there was a live band playing the best music you remember from your college days, a plethora of different slumbrew options, and a pub style menu. I had the pretzel (-1 star). The pretzel itself was ok, if a bit small, but the dipping sauces were terrible. The mustard was weirdly sweet and gloopy, and the cheese sauce was watery and flavorless. I think I'll stick to beer going forward. This is also a great place to meet your friends with kids. There are tons of games to entertain them and little side areas for them to play in.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"3,"Seriously overpriced, but the appetizers and beer are good, and it's fun to go there and play board games.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Such a fantastic hang out! There are so many beer gardens in the city now, but this one is top notch for me. Not only is the beer fantastic - the staff really take it to the next level! Ethan is a wizard in the kitchen! Hard to find a place like this with such high quality and delicious food. The staff (Kira and Alyse) made great recommendations & our drinks were awesome! We stayed for hours -- after only planning to be there for one drink. The seating area is great; we played scrabble. Staff member, Shauna, was there to help us and took great care of our group throughout our entire time. Can't WAIT to come back!",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"4,"This is, sadly, my first and last review of American Fresh Beer Garden. I was staying with my cousin this weekend and we brought her kids here for dinner on Saturday night. It was packed and we did have to wait a minute for a table, but everyone here was so friendly and gracious. We noticed two gentlemen having a lean on a table and asked if we could snag it from them, to which they agreed without a second thought. Later we found a larger table and so we handed the tall table to the next people waiting. I love this concept. It's outside, open, and totally chill. The food is affordable, filling, and good value while still being pretty basic. The beer is great, too. I love the toy room and the fact that kids just wander around and no one is concerned. It feels like a neighborhood block party.So I was sad to learn they are closing down this location and opening up a brick-and-mortar elsewhere with a totally different concept. My cousin's 4-year-old was devastated as this is one of his favorite places to go. Hopefully they will have enough feedback from current visitors to realize they need to incorporate as much of their current feel into the new place as possible.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Whether enjoying the summer nights or waiting for a showtime at the AMC next door, I almost always stop into American Fresh to grab a sour or whatever new and/or interesting beer Slumbrew has available.They have some food available (the mustard with the pretzels are killer), board games, giant Jenga and occasionally live music. Puppers and kids are also welcome which helps me rope my friends who are parents into having an evening out.Surrounded by an expanding manufactured environment (East Somerville gentrification weeee), American Fresh holds true to its identity and definitely wins Best of Assembly in my book.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"3,"I LOVE Slumbrew beer, and I always have a blast coming out here for Monday night trivia. However, I can't in good conscience give this place a rating of any more than three stars, since my food experiences as of late have all been of below-average quality (while unfortunately also being a bit overpriced); additionally, I've had multiple experiences of them being out of the beers that they were advertising, which was a bummer.To start with the good - Happy Sol has become one of my favorite local beers, and is generally what I recommend to first-timers here who are looking for something that will go down pretty easy. I also do appreciate the focus that they place on bringing in events like trivia, live music, etc. - I don't know if we would have tried this place had it not been for trivia night!But, there are also quite a few things that American Fresh needs to work on. From my experiences, the food quality depends completely on the evening. While the cheddar ale soup (which comes topped with pretzel nuggets) is typically a yummy option here, the last time I had it, it was SO boozy and bitter that I couldn't even finish it. I had a good experience with their antipasto salad a few months ago, but when I ordered it again recently, it was half the usual size and missing a few of the normal ingredients. I also tried their herb and cheese pizza recently, and was very underwhelmed. I had seen folks order some of their other flatbread pizzas a few months ago, which looked delicious, but this one came out looking and tasting like a microwave pizza.I'm looking forward to visiting Slumbrew's other location in Somerville sometime soon, as it appears that the menu there is a bit bigger (and hopefully a bit more reliable) - and with the same delicious beer!",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Whether you will like this place depends completely on what you're looking for.What this place is: - A tiny outdoor beer garden with a pub-in-a-park atmosphere; some tables have umbrellas, others don't. Board games copious.- Baby quotient significantly higher than the average brewery. Lots of toddlers running around, kids on tricycles, a few dogs here and there (there were 2 very sweet and well-behaved Goldens there during our visit). - Can be crowded; seating not guaranteed - if you don't mind finding a corner to stand in for a bit until seats open up, then you're good.- They have tasty Slumbrew beer on tap, served in plastic cups. Selection varies: be flexible about your options in order to have the best time. Current Slumbrew options are available in 4-pack cans for purchase, too.- Very, very casual. Very casual. Did I say casual? Like a bar in someone's backyard. Service is on par with the atmosphere. If you go with that in mind, you'll have a good time.What this place isn't:- A reserved-seating, table-service place that can guarantee a certain experience for you and your group. Don't like little kids running around, dogs, or a super-casual atmosphere? This probably isn't the place for you.- A traditional bar. You can run a credit card tab, but still need to go stand in line again to order every round.- A restaurant. Don't come here to eat, come here to drink. The food is overpriced, microwaved, and not good. If you need a bar snack, that's one thing, but this isn't the place to go for a meal.Personally, I had a great time and really enjoyed this place. The casual, friendly atmosphere made it feel more like a traditional British pub than an American bar, but with cold IPA's, sunshine, and Connect Four instead of warm ale, wood paneling, and darts. There's a specific audience for this type of place, and it will do very well.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"2,"Came here last night for a date. The date itself was great, but our time at Slumbrew was unfortunately sub-par.We knew the bar was outdoors, but we did not expect that only around 3 of the tables would have umbrellas, or that getting those tables would be near impossible. It started sprinkling just after my date and I ordered. Since we wanted to sit down and enjoy our food, we decided that a little light rain wouldn't turn us away. Besides, the staff would surely bring out extra umbrellas or a tarp, right?WRONG. The staff did nothing about the rain. They remained in their covered kitchen, leaving the paying customers to fend for themselves. Did they fail Customer Service 101?The food and beer themselves were pretty good. We ordered the soft pretzel and the turkey sandwich with mac n' cheese on the side. I loved the soft pretzel, which came with nacho cheese and dijon mustard for dipping. The sandwich was a standout because of the delicious bread (they source from Iggy's!). I expected the bread to be chewy because of its thick crust, but it was perfect. The mac n' cheese was good insofar as pasta and cheese combos never fail. Nothing stood out about it, though.The rain eventually got to be too much to tolerate. We ended up leaving early to catch a movie. I wanted to eat more food, but soggy pretzels are not very delicious. :/",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"1,"We ordered empanadas and waited 30 mins before going up to ask why they were taking so long. Went up to the guy and they said they forgot about them. No apologies or anything. Unacceptable. We asked for a refund and even that took 10 minutes. He said he voided it but he seemed like he didn't know what he was doing. And again, no apologies. So ridiculous.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"3,"I went here this weekend to try some of the local beers on tap with my gf. Before visiting, I had went on the website and saw a special that was going on - buy two beers get the pretzel app for free! AWESOME! When ordering our beers, I asked the lady working the cash about the deal. She seemed annoyed by the question and quickly responded with ""we don't have that, those are random"". Her tone and lack of detail appeared that she just didn't want to go through with the effort to do the special. I proceeded to ask more about the special and she gave very little help, not even explaining that the deal had just passed or that it was done on a specific day. I felt awkward after asking. But we finished our order and I went online to verify that this special was in fact not available any more. Overall the beer was tasty and the atmosphere was relaxing (outdoor seating with music). However, I rated this down one star because of the customer service.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"3,"Weird. That's all I'll say. Poorly built tables and chairs barely able to support a normal human being strewn in the midst of a concrete tiled floor with shipping containers acting as rooms. All inside a big white party tent. It is almost like the twilight zone.And then there are the hipsters laughing raucously On a Friday night while playing scrabble and in large groups wearing hats and overcoats.Weird.The chef bellows into the crowd, completely muffled by the yelps of joy, ""the salmon is ready."" The industrial heat blower kicks on and starting pumping gaseous smelling warmth into the space.Did I say weirder? One container houses several rows of kegs not ready for consumption. Double glass doors swing open and shut but don't match the decor. Signs stand high advertising for your next corporate get together. Weird, son.There's an entire container devoted to selling t shirts.A beer garden menu has no sausage on it.One half of the tent floor is exposed dirt concealed by giant cattle watering tubs with fake plants.It's so weird, but definitely not cool, that I'll end there.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Stumbled upon this place while looking for post-Legoland dinner with my 8 year old, who's only interested in hotdogs. This place advertises itself as a family-friendly beer garden, and that's completely true from what I saw. Great beers on tap. I had the imperial red (lobstah killah), which was so good that I bought a 4-pack. They had self-serve water and a good variety of drinks for kids or non-drinkers (juices, milk, sparkling sodas). I had the beer cheese soup, which came piping hot and served with a soft pretzel floating on top. It was incredible. I also got the antipasto salad, which was peppered with pickled, spicy vegetables and served with a tasty homemade vinaigrette. It was more than enough food for me. My kiddo had two hotdogs that liked good, if you're into hotdogs (he loved them).The atmosphere was great, too. They have a ton of board games and even toys for young patrons that my 5 yo (and younger kids) would've enjoyed. The staff was super friendly, stopping by to talk with my son while I was using the (very clean) bathroom. Ultimately, I would totally spend a lot of time here if I lived in the area. I'm already trying to figure out how top spend a few more days of my vacation paying Risk and drinking fabulous beer here with my family.",American Fresh Beer Garden,"301 Canal St Assembly Row Somerville, MA 02143"3,"Found on Yelp after we went shopping at BBB. Good for what it is - a small, randomly located, quirky beer garden with decent beer. Â And lots of board games. Â But the food is mediocre and overpriced, it is indeed small as far as beer gardens go, with lackadaisical service. Â We were there on a Sunday at around 1 and it wasn't that crowded - easily got a table in the shade - and food came quickly. Â Surprised there weren't more people there.

Our eldest loves it for the Toy room and begs us to go, and we love it because beer. And also cool staff.Such a unique and cool concept to have a kid friendly beer garden. We asked the question whether they would continue to be kid friendly with a toy room, and were basically told ""no"" by one of the bartenders.If that's the case unfortunately I doubt we will return.

During the winter it is covered with a large heated tent, you do not feel like you are outside at all. They have live music and board games.

We parked a block away and braved the rain as we and made it over to this beautiful cafe where there was a massive line outside. I headed inside and was greeted by Mike who smiled and asked if I needed a table. I told him yes and that it was three of us, he asked if everyone in my party was present and we were, so he sat us right away. The inside of this place is small enough to be called a cafe but big enough that we didn't feel cramped and we weren't bumping into each other. The layout of the tables offer great space for moving or getting up for drinks (which are self serve for most). Overall we were quite comfortable at our table. The service was great as our server was kind and asked clarifying questions making sure she got our order right. It was quite busy this Saturday morning but we didn't feel rushed at all and the other servers seemed to be working seamlessly with each other to get the job done. Our food arrived and my pancakes (banana chocolate chip) were still smokin' hot! Literally steam was coming off of the pancakes as I lifted them layer by layer!! So delicious so filling and mouthwateringly good!! My sister got the famous macaroon and coconut French toast and I have no idea what my brother in law got but it was all so delicious!! I must add that I took a trip to the restroom and I'm always afraid to use public bathrooms but this bathroom was incredibly clean! It's tucked right next to the kitchen so I was relieved to see that it was clean even on a busy day! I want to thank Mike so much for the warm welcome and the fantastic greeting that is going to have me coming back for many years to come. I appreciate the chef for putting his best foot forward and making a delicious meal that warmed my belly and my heart, and to the servers who were so kind and efficient your hard work never goes unnoticed. And last but not least to all of you wonderful people who made it to the end of this review I see you and I thank you! xoxo",Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Went to Ball Square Cafe for some brunch on Saturday. The place tends to get packed but thankfully we didn't have to wait too long to get seated inside (two people). I've been here before and have really enjoyed their pancakes and sandwiches on a croissant. To start we ordered the cappuccino which was alright, not the best quality espresso and I'd probably opt for the refill drip coffee next time. For our actual meal we got a side of bacon, eggs Benedict in English muffin with artichoke hearts (a super interesting menu item), and the glorious morning sandwich on a croissant which consists of fried egg with avocado, tomatoes, and onions. The bacon was super crispy and really tasty. The eggs Benedict were alright, I wouldn't order again as it's not really my cup of tea and I'd maybe go for their banana chocolate chip pancakes which are amazing!!! The sandwich was really tasty even though it was a bit greasy at the bottom. Overall it's a solid crosandwich !I really like this cafe and would probably order the same sandwich but this time try another type of pancake or one of their French toast options. The staff is super friendly and really attentive. We didn't have to wait long for the food either !",Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Love the almost sphere. Very relaxing. Self serve beverage center. I would definitely recommend the Famous coconut macaroon French toast. Servings are very big, but you can get half orders!!! Husband hand the Mexican omelette, which had no meat in it. Over the top on cilantro, so maybe ask to hold that back a little. He said the cornbread muffin was the best he ever had. Tried the banana stuffed french toast. It was good but nothing compares to the FCMFT they serve. I had a half order of the pepper and corn beef hash Benedict. I personally was not a fan of the hash, a little to mush for me, but that is just me. Definitely will be back to bring my mom when she comes to visit so she can try the FCMFT and I can try a different benny.",Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"4,"I love this little hole in the wall cafe, the customer service is always great and energetic. It's a very small place, so if you go at the wrong time you will be waiting in a line outside for a table to clear (Saturday and Sunday mornings are rough)! When I go I usually try something different or a friend and myself will order two completely different meals and try each other's food. They have good pancakes and waffles and they offer turkey and veggie sausage, which is great because a lot of breakfast spots only offer pork. Their eggs always taste fresh, scrambled, omelet or however you order them. They have a section in the back near the kitchen where you can go up and get coffee and tea and other other drinks, and there's a huge variety for the coffee lovers.

Happy with the choice that my friend and I made for food. We shared the corned beef hash egg Benedict with the in-house grilled mashed potatoes (I believe it's called Omar fries?) as well as the banana nutella french toast. Both of them were scrumptious: definitely enjoy the moderately sweet, non-cloying french toast and the tasty homemade corned beef hash on an egg Benedict.

Be prepared to wait or come as a party of 2!There's ""all you can drink"" coffee, but honestly I only got up once to get my coffee. If you don't want to get charged the ""all you can drink"" price, get the paper cup and not the mug. Sweet pepper and corned beef hash eggs benedict ($17): Hollandaise sauce was unnaturally yellow and corned beef hash was very mushy, like it was mixed in the blender. Fit for a queen/king ($12.50): perfect for anyone who wants sweet and salty for breakfast. My partner ordered fried eggs with bacon and french toast. The french toast was picture perfect, but it was dry. One side of the french toast was dipped in the batter, but the other side wasn't. Very strange.Note: their home fries are grilled mashed potatoes, not roasted potatoes. I've been here before and BSC does a good job with the basics. I would not recommend the eggs benedict though. Our server was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. Overall, food was alright and overpriced.",Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Amazing. Be prepared to wait in line, but the line goes by fast! Even if you're in line everyone in the party needs to be there, or else they'll skip you.

Ball Square did JUST that.They have gluten free toast, English muffins, and even pancakes and waffles! I was baffled when I saw these options on their menu. The waitress was very sensitive to my needs and made sure I received a dish that I could eat (and enjoy!).My boyfriend and I ordered the French toast, the Moroccan eggs, a breakfast sandwich on a croissant, diced potatoes, and a side of French fries.The Moroccan eggs were amazing! As was the French toast. The French fries and the potatoes were also amazing (even though they were just sides!). Everything here is delicious, the servers are attentive, and the bottomless self-serve fresh OJ & coffee can't be beat!This place is very cozy and small, so you might wait a bit outside on the weekends, but they're very good about getting your food out quickly, so the wait is never too long!Will definitely be coming back.",Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast is the best breakfast bite in Greater Boston.

Seriously, it's that good.This trip home was cold; super cold even for Boston. Did that mean a shorter line? Nope. At one point I counted 16 people waiting. The ones that had been there before (or before Mike came out to tell everyone) all had steaming cups of strong coffee in hand. The java is self-serve. So while you wait just pop in and pour yourself a mug. It really helps.Once seated inside the small, well Tetrised space, you will get a menu filled with the best breakfast items you will find.

They even make their own veggie sausage.I always get omelets. This time I opted for the Mexican. Its 3 eggs stuffed with avocado, jalapeÃ±o peppers, tomatoes, scallions, cilantro and cheddar cheese. On top of that is a healthy dollop of sour cream. It's served with a grilled corn muffin. I got the side of grilled mashed potatoes and the veggie sausage.To say I left stuffed was an understatement.

One of the owners even gave me one of their shirts one day after I came in from a workout.Now I'm afraid as they are getting busier and busier they are paying less attention to the food as it leaves the kitchen.

Will be back!!,Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,"COCONUT MACAROON FRENCH TOAST.This was one of the best French toasts I've ever had - it actually reminded me of a coconut macaroon cookie! Perfectly toasted on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside. The toasted coconut added a nice sweetness and crunch to it. Together with the raspberry sauce and mascarpone, it was absolute breakfast n i r v a n a !! Seriously, why is this dish not featured on any of those ""100 Must-Eat Dishes Before You Die"" or ""Greater Boston Must Eat"" lists?! By the way, you can order this in full-size or half-size (side) - perfect if you want a side of sweet with your savory breakfast main. I sound like a dude talking about his main chick and his side chick, oops.Also tried the ""Our Favorite Plus"" breakfast plate and the mushroom omelet - both just as satisfying and good portion as the ones from my fave local diner. We're not coffee drinkers but we loved that they offered Mighty Leaf tea. Oh, don't forget to substitute your toast with a GRILLED MUFFIN (blueberry or corn) - game changer.Don't let the long line deter you away - I promise you: the French toast alone is worth it. Besides, you can peruse the long menu while you wait in line. Yes, you might be tempted to break through the window in hangry rage (don't do that). Just be patient...and you will be rewarded with brunch bliss with quick, friendly service, too!",Ball Square Cafe & Breakfast,"708 Broadway Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I chose this restaurant for my dad's birthday. First of all, it's a cute, little restaurant, and there were mostly couples there (we were a family of 4). Street parking is easy right outside the restaurant.The menu is really tiny since it's meant to be more of a place for wine and small bites. We probably ordered most of the menu. Everything was delicious and nicely plated, especially the asparagus dish, which isn't something I normally order. The service and wine of course was great too!",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I recently had the chance to attend a graduation party at Spoke and am so glad that this was the spot. Mary and her team run a fantastic operation. Â The wine list was impressive, the food was on point, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Â The bean dip, squid salad, charcuterie board, cauliflower, and gnocchi were all favorites of mine. Â You really can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. Â The restaurant space is narrow, but made for a great spot to get together with 50 or so family and friends. Â Very manageable for that size crowd. Â Overall, Spoke lived up to all the hype and exceeded expectations. Â I look forward to coming back next time I'm in the area. Â Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,Went with a group of friends this past weekend and had a great time. This little gem is located in the heart of Davis Square. Its very small place so you absolutely need a reservation. All the food we got was incredible the bean dip and the duck dish were our favorite but everything was amazing. The wine list is massive but our server was very knowledgable so she gave us great suggestions. Can't wait to have an excuse to go back here!!!!,Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Lovely place. Cozy. A few outside tables. I had the Carignan and the Grenache, and both wines were absolutely excellent. The gnocchi with morels and peas were yummy, too. Service was friendly, courteous, Â and they knew their wines. That's how staff in a wine bar should be!",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"After living around the corner from this restaurant for 6 months, I finally made it here! It was worth it!I was able to try 5-6 tapas style dishes, and all of them were quite an experience. The highlights we're the pear salad, lamb tartare, and smoked butter bean dip.The pear salad had sweet beautifully rolled pears in the shape almost like a flower. They were hidden under a blanket of greens and perfectly toasted macadamia nuts. Yum!The lamb tartare was the best tartare I've ever had. It was seasoned perfectly!The smoked butter bean dip was the simplest dish. The smoked flavor was definitely present, and this was super addicting. My date and I went through this dish in about a minute. It was THAT good.",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"3,"Ive been dying to go here for YEARS and was super underwhelmed. I think our biggest mistake was that we came here with five people. The plates are SMALL so we literally each got one bite of every dish. I guess that one bite was good though. You're also going to be spending a pretty penny. The dishes are super small for the price. I'm also not a big wine person so I got a cocktail, not sure if the wine here compensates for the small plates but maybe it does. Definitely come here with max one other person.",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Fast and friendly service! The waitress gave us recommendations for drinks and she was very patient while waiting for us to make our decisions! I got the Garden Level - rye, amaro, citrus and mint. IMy friend had The Slip - tequila, banana, amaro and coffee bitters! It smelled like a banana, but tasted like smooth, velvety chocolate. I will definitely be back for this! The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and warm - they have a gorgeous wall paper and dim lighting. For a large group (~5-7) there is a small couch section or they have high top tables that can be moved. The bar area is light with small candles and faces a beautiful/well stocked bar!",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I was so bummed when this place temporarily closed last year, and was elated when they reopened a couple of months ago! If the space alone doesn't do it for you (so cozy and quaint), the food and drinks certainly will! My favorite bevvie right now is A Little Influence. Such a great drink and if you're into mezcal! I came here last week with a friend, and I've turned her into a fan, too!For dinner we split the Black Garlic Linguini and the Bass special they had. You had a choice between the shoulder or the head, we went with the shoulder cut. It was delish! They served it with some kind of purÃ©e as well which was outta this world. Super excited to live walking distance from this place, and super excited they are open again",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"A nice little spot with some interesting menu choices. It can be a bit pricey for what you get, so I usually find it better for an after-dinner stop-in or more of a light meal.",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Had a delicious small plate at Spoke. Â It sounded so odd, but when it came---omg, it was so good. The flavors! With it, I had a glass of rose. Â The service was excellent. Â The place is small, and it did get noisy as more and more people packed in. Â Not a huge meal, but definitely imaginative and---did I say?---delicious.",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"No doubt the best restaurant in the Davis Square area. If you are looking for great ambiance, an incredible and eclectic wine menu as well as shockingly good food, Spoke is the spot. Â Every time I have been to Spoke, I have discovered something new and exciting, weather it was a cool new orange wine, a delicious pasta with hard to find local and fresh ingredients or just some great neighbors to have a conversation with. The hospitality has always been a major plus, but the menu: always changing, adventurous and unique is reason to keep coming back. Ask your server what their favorite wine selection that day is, as everyone is informative welcoming and eager to open your mind the new thing, y'all!",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I had the Rhubarb dessert and the chocolate! It's was really good! My friend lives nearby and invited us to have some dessert there. I really love the atmosphere, the couches next to the window was so cozy! The dessert was delicious! Would recommend it to anyone looking for cozy chill wine bar with some digestive dessert!",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"3,"Went back with another couple to check out the new reopening. Â Really disappointed. Â The food is still amazing - lamb tar tar, fried oysters, the squid salad... we had more than half the menu and loved everything other then the burrata, which was somehow poorly executed and way too salty. Â So 5 stars there still.However, while of course this is small plates and an upscale joint, I get it, the portions are laughable. Â ""Smalls"" and ""mains"" are more or less the same size, barely allows for 4 people to share and the tab creeps up very quickly. Â And the price is $2-5 more than it should be for every single item. The artichokes? Literally 5 pieces. Â The cocktails were super disappointing too - way too sweet. Â Wine was fine, but we didn't love the suggestion from the bartender and there was only 1 American red on the whole menu. Â Odd.All in all...the small plates trend is pulled off way better at appropriate prices at Oleana, Little Donkey...save your wallet and go there instead.",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,Spoke is a superb wine/small plates shop found right next to the famous Dave's Fresh Pasta. The wine list will surely pass most wine aficionado's scrupulous eye.Order the:Marinated Olives (out of this world)Duck Liver Mousse ( with green strawberries and scrumptious slightly burnt bread)Scallop Crudo Octopus (perfectly seasoned with a light garnish)I will be back again.,Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Definitely one of the most creative and delicious places in Somerville right now. I'm a pasta lover, and I appreciate Spoke's home-made pasta game. The casareccie (sp?!) was delicious. The mint and lemon paired perfectly with the tender veal. Other highlights were the cauliflower, tostada & halibut. The owner, Mary is super attentive, the bartenders make delicious drinks, and aren't stingy with the wine pours. I wish there was a grimier version of Spoke. Let's call it ""I done already Spoke witchu."" I imagine the bartenders yelling at me, drinking too much wine and being told to leave. After a couple of weeks pass I would sheepishly stick my head in the door, apologize and repeat my last offence. Thank you Spoke.",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"We had a wonderful Birthday dinner! Our server described their food as thoughtful with incredible flavors and how perfect that statement was. The smoked butter bean dip was smooth lusciousness spread on grilled bread. The charcuterie plate, scallops and morel mushroom and ricotta ravioli were all amazing! We were going to skip dessert but our server surprised us with a birthday pot de creme, which was absolutely delicious! We highly recommend Spoke! The atmosphere, the people/servers and the food! Oh the food!",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Loved my dinner at Spoke! Â The ambience is fantastic. Â Cozy, yes. Â But friendly and not at all oppressive to me.

Â Strong flavors that seem like they should never be brought together but harmonize perfectly in your glass.Small plates. Â We ended up getting three each.

The place is small- maybe fifteen tables- and was bustling. We were seated at high top tables in the back and didn't feel crowded at all. The service was great- thoughtful, informative and approachable.We had five dishes: the broccoli, fried oysters, crudo, scallops, and the ganache dessert. All of them were delicious, but the scallops (with squid ink and pomme pure) were my favorite.Highly recommend!",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,Service was excellent. The mezze plate was the bomb.com. Who knew a tiny spread made of beets could make someone so happy?! Definitely coming back. We also got tiny dessert bites even though we only ordered the mezze. Nice touch. Chocolate and peanut butter morsels are always welcome.,Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Really solid. I really enjoyed this place. We got:- Santa rosa plum gazpacho, burrata, stone-fruit panzanella- Heirloom tomatoes, sugar snap pea, bacon bread crumbs, ranch dressing- Heirloom sqashes, hazelnut, roasted grapes, red onion- Sweet pea spaetzle, feather brook farm chicken, chanterelle, creme fraiche- Duck meatballs smoked almond ajo blanco, grapes, jicama, mint- Chocolate torta vanilla labneh, raspberry, almondWe were somewhat disappointed that a lot of the amazing looking dishes in the Yelp pictures weren't on the menu, but these delivered in a really strong way. One big theme was that the sauces were particularly great, and somewhat hidden in certain cases (you had to dig for them in the tomatoes and the squashes, but once you got there they were incredible). The sauce that came with the tomatoes was minty and perfect, and I would have ordered that alone as a soup if that was an option. And the actual soup (the gazpacho) was basically perfect -- I've never had burrata come in this kind of setting, but it was amazing and probably our favorite dish of the night. Also, the grapes that came with the squashes weird weirdly incredible -- I don't know what they roasted them in, but they were awesome. The other big highlights for me were the torta and the duck meatballs.Overall, this was a really good dinner and I'm glad we picked this place.",Spoke Wine Bar,"89 Holland St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"A cute little whole in the wall Thai place; was craving some curry after chatting with my friends and looking around the neighborhood. The place offers call in's, take out and eat in, has free water and tea available and lunch deals. Would come to this place again, if I happen to be in the neighborhood. Friendly staff, large portion and affordable pricing.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"2,"We have been here or done take out at least 30 times, so I will try my best to be helpful.Guys, you have good product-market fit, so please invest in better service. I am not asking for fine dining experience but a decent customer experience. 1. Do not mix orders. Invest in a system where the kitchen gets the exact and full order and you don't have receptionist trying to remember all orders. It's frustrating to have your second momo come after 55 minutes of wait. Or to have your veg momo mixed with chicken momo.2. Time - if you know some days are going to be busy, then please keep an extra helping hand. Waiting 35 minutes just to get your samosa-chat is unacceptable.3. First come, first serve - it is unacceptable to have others who came after you get their food (same food) before you. Again, this may be related to #1 above.4. Offer people discounts or free food when things go wrong. For example, do not assume everyone is non-vegetarians in a group. If a group orders a bunch of things, please do not assume everyone is sharing everything. Have receptionist trained so they can ask customers what would they like first on busy days.5. Always send couple's food order together, at the same time. It is absolutely ridiculous to bring one persons order (non-veg) while the other person waits (veg). Again, see #3 above. Couples eat together. And couples may be veg/non-veg.6. Faster service - you are not McDonald and we understand that. But you should try to aim to get all orders fulfilled within 20 minutes. 30 minutes is absolute max. I have waited upto 55 minutes at your place. This needs to be improved or you won't have people coming back to you who value time.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"3,I was craving for momos and we found this place near by. The reviews were great and thought of giving it a try. We ordered veg stir fry noodles and veg momos with bottled soda. The noodles were okay but momos were bad. They were bland and steamed too much. FYI- I couldn't find the restroom Â in the restaurant but do ask if you visit. They provide throw away utensils and serve you the food in take out boxes. The ambience is very casual with limited seating. Overall- Ambience- 3Food- 4,Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,Too good to pass up. Yes his place has excellent momo.

Each is made with love, it's definitely homemade and awesome. My meticulously packaged order came with two sauces, one spicy and the other mild and more tangy - a generous amount to go with the eight momos. The meat is moist and juicy, and the outer wrap soft but not sticky, they were both of the perfect texture! If you think one order is small, you are sorely wrong! I was absolutely stuffed after slowly finishing off my plate. I will probably be a regular going forward, I must have some of that naan and biryani!",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Solid place to get your curry fix! I dropped by for a quick lunch and took advantage of their lunch time prices! Woo!For $8 plus tax, I got the Chicken Tikka Masala which comes with sooooooooo much rice and lots of naan. You're gonna be so happily stuffed after a meal at Momo N Curry! The chicken meat itself was a little dry, but the awesomeeeeee sauce more than compensated. It's creamy, without being too rich and heavy. And totally perfect for soaking up all the rice and naan that your stomach can handle! Def interested in coming back to explore the rest of the menu, especially during weekday lunchtimes. They have special weekday deals for their Momos too! YESS!!",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"This review is only for the momo take out. I am usually disappointed at momos, wraps are often too thick and filling too dry. Basically its a rough version of chinese dumpling. Pass. However these momos are amazing. The wraps are super thin and the fillings are very interesting. I got the spinach and peener and the lamb ones. They are both really really good. Its also an interesting flavor i haven't had anywhere else. The lame one has strong lame flavor which i like and not dry. The sauce is also really good, has a kick but not killing your flavor bud spicy. It is a bit pricy compare to other momo 10 dollar for 6 but its wroth it.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"2,"Small little takeout spot with counter service and 4-5 tables. Prices are surprisingly high but it must be due to the real estate.The spinach momos were good and looked handcrafted. However, the aloo gobi was oversalted where you can still taste salt over spice even after cutting it with the basmati rice. The portions were decent but it doesn't matter if you don't like the food.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,Great little place. Yummy momos n curry. Looking forward to my third visit. Depending on the day of the week they might have a discounted price on either veg or chicken momo which is pretty nice.,Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Definitely worth the visit! The free chai is a nice touch. I liked both the chicken and lamb momo (7.5$ and 10$ respectively) a lot. Tasty and flavorful. The wrapper was a little delicate though -- I think around 1/3 of them had broken wrappers. I didn't think the mushroom curry (13$) was that good though. It was a little spicy, but the flavor wasn't really anything special. I'd go back for the momo for sure!",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"AMAZING food! Everything tastes just like it does in Nepal - very authentic! The samosa chaat was my favorite, it was absolutely delicious and the best I've had anywhere in Boston.And it gets better .. they have FREE MASALA TEA, which also tasted just like at home :) Can't wait to go back here!",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"As far as authentic, true to its spiciness ratings, and get your craving for Nepalese/Indian food this is as good as it gets in this area!Atmosphere: very clean, the kitchen is tucked away so you don't come out smelling like Indian food after your experience. They also always have Marsala tea available for free. Service: reliable, friendly, and attentive. Food: INCREDIBLE! Every dish I've tried have not disappointed me. You also need to ensure to try their breads. And try something else other than naan, my choice is usually poori (if eating there). All of their curries are fresh, flavorful and not greasy. I recommend your usual tikka masala or butter chicken. Momo's have many unique fillings to choose from - spinach paneer is wonderful. The dough is very light and the fillings are always flavorful. Highly recommend this place as eat-in or takeout, I will drive distance for it if I have to.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"3,"I came here twice, for dining in the first time when I got Momos and Chicken Tikka Masala, and for just Momo takeout the second time.The first time I thought everything was pretty good but a bit pricy. The Tikka Masala was very saucy and spicy which are both definitely a plus. I did like that they had free Chai to enjoy while I waited and with the food.The Momos however both times were not that great. I assumed that maybe because that's the dish that is featured in the name of the restaurant that it would be really amazing, but they were just ok, not too juicy or special with the fillings. Especially given that it was pricy for a plate of these ($10 for 8 I think if you get the mixed momo) I remember not being too enthused about them as a whole.Maybe I'll give it another shot!",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Tried this place after having read the reviews . I wasn't disappointed. The momo's were best I have had in Boston. However same can't be said about the noodles, it was way too oily and weird tasting. Definitely will return for momo's. good value for money and adequate quantity of food.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"/ BOTTOM LINE:Small space (but they do a ton of takeout business), lovely service (but you get to watch interesting programming on the TV), and delicious food. A great place for affordable and fast food while still trying something new. / THE SPACE:Only a couple of tables (~20 people) in place. You order at the counter and there's free chai tea!/ THE FOOD:MOMO -- Their must-gets are the momo of course. The momo options and the rest of the menu are super vegetarian friendly -- we got the lamb momo which was delicious, but there was spinach/peer momo and chicken momo, too. It comes with a couple of sauces that are spicy and not-so-spicy. PLANTAIN CURRY -- a continuation of their vegetarian friendly dishes. The plantains still had bite to it and the curry came with jasmine rice to sop up all the delicious sauce. GARLIC NAAN -- was hot and was instrumental to my finishing off of aforementioned curry sauce.Would come back in a heartbeat.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"1,Ordered and found piece of plastic in the food.

Wonder how's it having ratings so good.,Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"3,"Small little restaurant tucked away in Somerville right across from Market Basket. The menu ranges from curry dishes, Momos, rice dishes, and naan. Overall menu seemed a bit more expensive than other Indian/Himalayan/Nepalese places I've been to. We tried the Mixed Momos which let us taste all the different types of Momos. Momos looks like Chinese soup dumplings but taste like regular dumplings without the soup. I wasn't particularly fond of them and they didn't taste like any special. Over $1 for a dumpling is overpriced in my opinion.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"2,Not that great for Momo's. Wouldn't recommend when there are so many better places nearby,Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"4,"This place has some great food.The other reviews are a bit misleading. This place is really small, maybe 16 chairs among 4 tables. This isn't the place for groups. This place is also kind of like a diner; it's not particularly ""fancy"" and has the atmosphere of a quick bite. There also isn't wait staff: if you sit down to eat you have to buy a bottle of water or a can of soda. Again, food is delicious but this is more of a takeout place IMO.",Momo N Curry,"431 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Food is amazing. Relatively unknown spot, but for me one of the best Indian places in Boston, if not the best.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"I really love how Yelp can bring people together. Literally. I met one of my friends, Raunaq ""Naq"", Â through Yelp last year. After seeing his YouTube video on Bangladeshi food that was taped in Jackson Heights, Queens, I was beyond intrigued. I thought there was no one better who can introduce us to Bengali food than Naq himself. Fast forward last Saturday when Naq suggested we should meet at Royal Bengal. He was there with his lovely girlfriend and I came with my husband. This was the first time I had finally met him. The owner's mother greeted us, and Naq took over from there. Which was perfect because everything described on the menu sounded delicious to my husband and I. Naq also explained to her not to make the dishes too spicy because his girlfriend and I can't handle too much spice. The menu is extensive. They offer both Indian and Bengali cuisines. We specifically ordered from the Bengali Specials. We didn't have to wait for very long for our food to arrive. We ordered 4 entrees to share, Luchi (which is fried bread), and 3 orders of Basmati rice. I have 2 favorites from that dinner: Chingrir Malaikary (shrimp in coconut gravy) and Kasha Mangsho (sauteed goat meat). With all the interesting and delicious food in front of us, our conversation flowed effortlessly. The restaurant is small and I thought I counted 8, maybe 9 tables. If you have a large party, I would suggest making a reservation so they can set tables together before you get there. You can message them through Yelp for your reservation, which I did, and the owner responded right away. Of course don't expect a speedy reply when he's busy cooking. Make sure you do a Yelp check-in so you can get 10% off dinner. Parking in this side of Somerville is easy. Plenty of available street parking on Medford St and the corner street, which is School St. The restaurant doesn't serve alcohol, but you're in Somerville so I'm sure you can find a watering hole to go to after your dinner. If you're not familiar with Bangladeshi food, I highly recommend watching this video with Naq in it.

I get into those modes when I just really want Indian food, something savory. Anyway, the food cam super fast and still hot (Love fast delivery when I'm starving, Love when it's still hot cuz i mean....who doesn't) One thing I learned is...if you aren't good with handling too much spice, you need to ask for the most mild type of spice control when ordering. I was so hungry so I left it the way it was; on medium and it was very very spicy to me. I could only eat a little at a time but it was definitely really good! I ordered the Lamb and Potatoes in a curry sauce, that was the spicy dish. It was soooo good so I kept making myself eat more. Next time, I'll adjust the spice level to mild for that dish. I also got the Paleek Paneer which I get everywhere. It was ok, not the best but definitely not the worst. Not bad overall, would order again!",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Discovering a Bengali cusine restaurant was least expected on our trip to Boston :) and to be honest, my husband and I were both surprised and happy!We went in for dinner and ordered luchi, kasha mangsho, rohu curry. The portions were generous and tasted very homely cooked. All the dishes were delectable and not very oily at all.We went back for lunch the following day and had the ilish macher paturi in banana leaves (bhapa) and some chicken curry - tasted really good.The restaurant requires atleast two day notice/preorder for the bhapa but opon learning we were in Boston only for the weekend, the owner accomodated us and made the bhapa ready for lunch the following day.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"1,Food was definitely bad. The Mutton kasa was no way what its supposed to be and the chicken dish was equally bad. One can really smell the raw garlic-ginger paste. Both the gravies were almost same. The only star was for delivery time n the burnt chapati,Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"This place is a dive but in the best way possible. It's owned by the cutest family. They have family photos on the wall! The food is absolutely incredible. I'm pretty new to Indian food so I'm not use to how spicy it can be but everything was so good for such great prices. We got Lamb Korma, Chicken Saag, Garlic Naan, Aloo Naan and Vegetable Samosas. So much food and everything was amazingly delicious. The specialities (entrees) do come with rice. This is definitely our go to Indian place in Somerville now! Hopefully next time I can get it slightly more mild than spicy haha!",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Just ate here for the first time. As someone who's never really found an Indian dish completely satisfying (because I never knew what to get), I was super excited when I wanted to eat their Chicken Korma forever. It was amazing! We got here super late (20 min before closing - I know, horrible) and we could definitely tell the waitress had anxiety because of this. I didn't mind rushing, though. They also honored my free naan (any flavor) from checking in on Yelp.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"I've been in Boston for less than two years, but Royal Bengal is by far my favorite Indian restaurant. I could see where a more sophisticated customer might call the location a ""hole in the wall,"" and the service is mediocre, but that's a small price to pay.Why? Because you don't come here for outstanding service or charming ambiance, you come here for the best Indian food in town! I judge all Indian restaurants by how well they make my favorite dish: chicken tikka masala. I find it difficult to dislike this dish, unless it's done really terribly. At most good Indian restaurants, it's a creamy, flavorful delight. But Royal Bengal takes it to a level I never thought possible: not only is it creamy and delicious, but they add a spicy tanginess that has forced me to set a new standard for chicken tikka masala!Very highly recommended.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"4,So even though i'm vegetarian i ate here last night. Ordered via yelp and picked up. Ordered some roti and kadahi paneer which was their best vegetarian dish when i checked the reviews. The roti was a little too crisp and thin for my liking (which is why the 4 stars) but the subzi was delicious. It was very spicy (i had asked for it) and flavorful. I thought it was just the color but no it had great flavor as well. Had ordered some mishti doi which i didnt end up tasting. All in all great food for a reasonable price.,Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,Some of the most delicious Indian dishes I have tasted! We had the Palak Paneer and Chicken Korma. The samosas are incredibly flavorful with the perfect amount of spices. Mango lassi is perfectly thick.,Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"I've been here three times. This place is a little gem. It's a small mom and pop shop. Don't expect fabulous service or anything. (Not that it's bad by any means). It's run by two or three people. The food is absolutely fantastic I have had the Gobi fry , Garlic naan/butter naan, machaar Jhal, Kasha Mangsho, Dal chicken. Everything was great. P.S. Â If you're an Indian reading this review and want to know if it's authentic ( because that's mostly all we care about.). Â Yes it is AUTHENTIC, DELICIOUS and LEGIT.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Ordered goat biryani, malai kofta, and samosa chaat. Everything was delicious, and I like their flavor combinations a lot. We just moved into the area, and this will definitely be my go to Indian restaurant going forward!",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"The imperfect turnover press marks, the wonderfully spiced and deliciously flavored filling, the satisfying crunch - all evidence pointed to their vegetable samosas being made by hand and made with love. Â My friend was convinced an Indian grandma made them - they were so satisfying. So far, this is the best Indian food my friends and I have had for awhile - we ordered the lamb saag, the aloo ghobi, the chicken tikka masala, and the lamb vindaloo. We got delivery so the review is based on that alone. Lamb vindaloo was the group favorite: tender lamb heaped in a spicy, tasty flavored curry. When I say spicy, I mean great heat, great spice profile.Lamb saag: tasty. I liked it better next day though.Chicken tikka: another group favorite, amazing for naan dipping.Aloo ghobi: a great complement to all the rest. Loved the curry flavor and consistency of the cauliflower, cooked just right, with enough crunch.I can't speak to the naan - we cheated and had Trader Joe's frozen naan (don't knock it till you've tried it! I will gladly save money on naan over time and order more curry and samosas from here).Lastly, I loved their masala chai - perfection. I haven't had a chai that good in at least 2 years - the spice blend was perfect, and I can't tell if they put sugar in it but it wasn't very sweet - I'm glad for that. It was subtle and aromatic and tasty and I wish I could have it every morning, but alas! They open at 11am. Get your Indian food fix here. So worth it!",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Really good and authentic Home-style Bengali food. We ordered the Kaasha Mangsho , Shorshe Maach and lucchi..ended up eating twice as much as we intended to. No frills, quick service, good food.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"3,"Quite a find - informal but great taste. Don't expect too much ambiance. Three hungry souls descended for a Â nice meal. Place was humming with business on a Wednesday evening - definitely Â a pretty good sign. Single wait-person was having bit of a time keeping up with the demand. Some patrons were greeted with name - regulars, another good sign.Ordered a couple of entrees - karahi paneer (cottage cheese with green peppers and onions) and yellow dal (soupy lentils). Lentils were not on the menu, so we were glad to that they obliged with our request. Â Both veg entrees were delicious with a real ""home cooked"" taste. Green peppers and onions were crisp, fresh, and cooked to the right tenderness. Highly recommended. Nothing appeared pre-cooked, including the appetizer. The wait was not horribly long either.The tandoori Rotis, however, left much to be desired. The first round was well cooked but stiffened fast and hit the palate coarse (way beyond how a whole grain flatbread Â normally feels). The second round was too raw -perhaps became a casualty of speed as we ordered the second round mid-meal. Don't recommend tandoori Rotis - go for rice or naans.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"1,"While at the restaurant with my parents, I had a chance to talk to the cook in my the native language (Bengali). She seemed to be a really nice lady. 2 mins into the conversation, the manager of the restaurant (possibly, wife of the owner) started scolding the cook and asked her to get back into the kitchen. She yelled at her for talking to the customers directly. We felt a bit odd after this incident but didn't react. After about 10 mins, the same cook came out and said that one of the items we had ordered was not fresh so we should consider changing it. We were very appreciative of her concern and immediately changed the order. When the manager came to know about this, she went back into the kitchen and started scolding the cook very badly. She was so loud that we could hear every single word she uttered. We felt very uncomfortable and a little annoyed at the owner's reaction. We still didn't react and continued to keep quiet. At the end, when the waiter brought us the receipt, it didn't reflect the changes we had made to the order so I suggested that they should correct it. After making the changes, the manager yelled at the cook once again. The manager (husband of the manager) had also stepped into the restaurant some time ago. He also started yelling at the poor cook and was very rude to her. I was almost scared if he was going to hit her. We didn't see anything but could hear everything. We paid our bill and immediately and left the restaurant. After coming back home, I decided to take action. I called the restaurant and asked for the owner. After only uttering a statement that I was calling about the quarrel, he hung up the phone on me.I called the Somerville police and asked for ""police officer"" but it went to their voicemail. Then my parents advised me not to pursue this further as they said it was not serious enough to report to the police. I still feel responsible for telling everyone about this incident and hence the post. I'm going to post this to every portal - Yelp, Trip, Google and open table.Thanks!",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,Hands down the best Indian food I've eaten all year. Family run establishment tucked into what looks like an old convenience store. They have a bunch of Bengali specialties and a lot of options aside from the standard curry and samosa. Their Garlic naan had a ton of fresh garlic and cilantro. I had the Lamb Korma which had the perfect amount of spice and meat. The portions are large and I ended taking about half my meal home (dinner for tonight!). Their mango lasie is a perfect way to cap off an amazing spicy and delicious dinner.5 Stars! Can't wait to eat my way through the rest of the menu!,Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"I go to this place often and simply love this place. Have tried most of there stuff but my top 3 would be ""Sorsho Maach"" , ""Kosa Mangsho"" and ""Dal Fish"". I am a Bengali and his place brings back the ghar ka khana(home cooked food) memories. It's definitely not a party place but if you want to enjoy some good food then I would highly recommend this place.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"1,"An update: The originals owners (an old couple) have passed on this restaurant to their son, who now runs the establishment. The food quality and taste has deterioated to the level that almost all their original customers (including myself) have stopped going there. The meats are usually pre-made and kept in the fridge for weeks (you can tell this because after 1-2 days cooked frozen meats start getting chewier). Also the breads are undercooked and you literally eat the dough. All the originals chefs have left and there is a new chef with NO experience at all of cooking Indian food. I went their twice after their original owners left and both the times the food was horrible. I am never going there again. If you want to ruin the taste of Indian food for yourself feel free to go there.",Royal Bengal Restaurant,"364 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"I grew up in LA, where taco trucks are the norm and Spanish feels like the second official language of the city. Needless to say, it's been a struggle for me to find decent Mexican food here in Boston. So THANK YOU DON JULIO! It's a small, unassuming place with no frills - just the way I like it. The menu is in both Spanish and English - and what really made me feel comfortable that the place was legit was that their specials board was 100% in Spanish. They're not catering towards the Chipotle crowd here! I was super hungry so I got an Empanada (super cheesy and a bit oily from being fried), the guacamole (teeny tiny portions so skip this even if you love guac), as well as a taco combo platter of Al Pastor and Shrimp tacos. The Al Pastor was super juicy and deliciously marinated. No complaints because the flavors were on point! The shrimp was chopped and had a nice grilled/barbecued finish to them. It was also tasty but could've been a bit more generous. Also - the taco combo comes with rice AND beans so you'll be happily stuffed afterwards. Definitely recommend for an authentic and yummy meal!",Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"3,"This spot like many taco places in Somerville is Salvadorean. Which wouldn't be a problem except that they claim they are delivering the flavors of Jalisco, whilst putting tomatoes, Â shredded lettuce, and cheddar cheese on their carne asada tacos (meat was fine by the way) wrapped in a FLOUR tortilla. The hot sauce was not hot either.Tacos hover in the $3 range.",Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"How did I not know about Don Julio until last Sunday!?! We got the tacos al pastor, the beef tacos, an empanada, and a pupusa. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!!!They make the tortillas by hand, which is so incredible and unnecessary, and which adds such brilliant texture to the tacos. You cannot beat the quality, especially at such reasonable prices. I may never order from anywhere else for delivery ever again. In fact...I'm strongly considering ordering from here even though we just had dinner.",Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Best tacos ever! The ingredients are fresh the shrimp and steak are seasoned perfect! And the tacos have excellent flavor. The customer service is excellent and they are a family owned business.

Â It is unbelievable.,Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"I loved the shrimp tacos! The shrimp is freshly grilled rather than battered and deep fried, and I really enjoyed that the tacos were simply dressed with lettuce, cheese and pico de gallo rather than being drenched in chipotle mayo and other sauces. The flavors of the shrimp and fresh veggies were able to shine through instead of being masked by sauces. Don Julio's is also a great bang for your buck - tacos are well-filled and decently sized for $3. Will definitely come back!",Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"Dear God these are good. I ordered the combo of three tacos with carnita , beef, an chicken. They were delicious. Actually, even the rice and beans were tasty and I was compelled to eat them. I never usually eat the rice and beans since I most places they are either bland or too salty. Here it was perfect. No go easy on the hot sauce. It's the real deal. Â Onto the tacos. These are some hearty tacos with two soft corn shells per each taco . Walk in the back and you'll probably see a bowl of Masa waiting to be made into tortillas. They really make these fresh. I waited about ten minutes for my three tacos to be made. The service is also excellent . No one is bothering you while you eat but if you need something ask and they'll immediately take care of you.",Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"The tacos here are amazing and really well priced ($2.50 - $3)Had the shrimp and fish tacos, and then ordered another 2 shrimp tacos. If you can't guess, I thought the shrimp was much better :).Very authentic and custom cooked to order. The fact that they grill the shrimp is awesome!Ps: before you dump the whole sauce on top of the tacos (which I almost did), try it. It's quite spicy if you are not a fan of heat :)Update: came back - ordered 5 tacos (4 shrimp, 1 fish). Got a side of sour cream and guacamole! Just fantastic taste. Everything tastes so fresh. The people seem incredibly nice too!",Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"I got the steak fajitas and they were delicious. The fajitas are about 1 and half portions.

Yummmm",Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"5,"There are two kinds of Mexican restaurants. In the first, your empanada tastes like cheese-stuffed cardboard. Your sad excuse for ""fajitas"" will be dry and tasteless. Your waiter is a young marijuana-addicted hippy who can't tell the difference between an avocado and an adolescent beet.Then there are places like Don Julio.Your empanadas are gooey, yet crunchy, but somehow not oily. Your fajitas are crispy and peppery on the outside, and still juicy on the inside.

Best tacos I've had in Boston.We ordered the two empanadas and the taco combo (3 tacos with rice and beans) with 1 al pastor, 1 carne asada, and 1 carnitas. The empanadas (filled with chicken) were perfectly fried and not greasy. The tacos came on just-cripsy-enough corn tortillas, with juicy (but not greasy) meat.

I've tried the veggie enchiladas (loads of quality veggies with spicy enchilada sauce), nachos (giant order with the most delicious cheese blend), pupusas (highly recommend, I order at least one every time), and shrimp and fish tacos (fresh, flavorful seafood). All are the best I've had in the Boston area. Since it's a new restaurant, order soon and frequently to make sure it stays around! Â You won't be disappointed.

Â I ordered the combo1 beef and the tacos were delicious. Â I love fish tacos and noticed they were on the menu so I decided to order one to try them also. I was not disappointed. The beans and rice were great as well. Â I was not too crazy about the sauce on the side though. It was spicy (which I typically don't mind) but it had a strong fish smell and taste. Â The sauce went well with the fish taco but not the three in the beef combo. Â Getting the sauce on the side is a good idea until you personally decide if you like it or not.,Don Julio Restaurant,"514 Medford St Somerville, MA 02145"4,"Best burrito I've had in the area hands down.

I had the AYCE for $25, a Rebel IPA, which was great, and finished with coconut cake.The top sirloin, flap, and bacon wrapped beef were all great, the bacon wrapped chicken was okay, but I prefer dark meat if I'm eating chicken-the bacon made it tolerable.Next time, I will definitely start out with a smaller amount of each meat, cause I'd like to try more of the dozen+ cuts they offer.Only critique is that the wait staff really cater to the regulars, assuming you know what's options are available. I would still definitely come back next time I'm in the area! Can't dock a star for that, though, because the team as a whole was really friendly and have great smiles.Prices were reasonable, too! $6.50 for the pint of Rebel IPA, and only $4.50 for the coconut cake.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"My daughter is doing a keto diet and so she needs lots and lots of meat. Brazilian to the rescue. Service here was excellent and the gauchos brought us lots of tasty stuff including sirloin and skirt steak and sausages and more. All of it delicious and cooked the way we liked it.There is also a decent sized buffet line with the sides you might like with your meal, including rices and beans and salads and veggies. I had a few pieces of sushi which were nothing particularly creative (salmon nigiri and california rolls) but were good. I loved the fresh beets and the big fresh mozzarella cheese too.Good service from our waitress who kept drinks refilled and cleared dirty plates promptly.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"3,"Oliveira's is a Brazilian steak house restaurant that has both buffet/AYCE and weighted options. The options aren't very clear and we had to ask and verify our AYCE option with multiple people, including the host and waiters. It might be because the staff aren't all fluent in English, but our option was miscommunicated a lot. If you're doing AYCE, here are some tips. Make sure you have the little red/green circle to indicate when you're ready (or not ready) for meat. They'll also bring the meat to you, but you can also get meat from the buffet. (The more crowded it is with people doing AYCE, the quicker the meats seem to come out.) They also seem to have a hard time understanding how cooked you like your meat; when asking for medium rare, I either got very rare or medium (more on the well done side).As for the buffet section, there are options such as Brazilian options, salad and fruit, and even sushi. To be honest, the options aren't great and some of it is pretty mediocre. We're also not sure if the dessert is included, but our flan didn't end up on our check. Some things I did like were:+CHICKEN HEARTS+PINEAPPLE WITH CINNAMON+SIRLOIN+FLANAll in all, the experience was just okay. While it is not extremely expensive for the amount of food that you can get, I wouldn't jump at the opportunity to go again.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Went to Oliveira's to celebrate the engagement of a fraternity brother and his fiancÃ©e earlier that day. The staff was able to accommodate our table as soon as we walked in. I'm sure the reservation helped, but that was still impressive. Many restaurants still take their sweet time setting up a large party, but they were really prepared. All You Can Eat is perfectly priced at $28.99. You start with grabbing your sides at the side bar. They have different styles of rice, plantains, fries, a lot of stuff I didn't recognize, fruits and salads. I'd recommend going easy on the sides, because you're going to want to save room for all the meat that's going to pass by you. When you flip your meal card to the green side, the meat will come in stampedes. Sausages, pork meat, lamb, top sirloin, bacon wrapped chicken, stripped sirloin, THE WORKS. I would've had PETA pissed if they walked in and saw my plate. Not to make fun, but the food was good. Another gem on the buffet is the cinnamon covered baked pineapple. Our table alone may have cleared two sticks of full size pineapples. SOOOOOOO GOOD! The only negative I'd say is that they were slightly being stingy with some of the meat. They'd cut you a small slice and ask you want more. Why ask? Just give. It's all I can eat. Let me eat. Regardless, you'd end up with the amount of food you want, but you may have to ask for more pieces/slices. Our waiters were cool! Checked on us regularly.

Â Aisles are tight with inebriated people at the bar backing their butts against your table and backs of chairs. Â We watched a really tight table cycle 3 different parties because it was wedged by the bar and entrance to the kitchen. Â That was like setting up a table in Grand Central station. Â I was annoyed when a drunk guy toasting his friends put his beer next to me on our table, but our server was on the ball and quickly took it away. Â It seemed unsafe with all the hot meat, sharp knives and steel spits flying around the dining room. Â I have to give credit to the meat and table servers just getting around with no mishaps.You have the option of doing the sliced-at-your-table AYCE meat and/or the salad/buffet line with cooked food and BBQ meat by the pound. Â The setup of the buffet line is poor and doesn't flow, so you might have to wait behind people that can't decide on what to get if a large party comes in.

I wish this place had a bigger selection of veggies / sides to pair with the meat because I felt that was very limited. Oh and funny thing is when you ask for the dessert menu, they literally bring out a plate of all their options for you to choose from. I've never seen that before haha. Additionally, the restaurant is ridiculously warm...you'll definitely break a sweat there. Back to the steak, they give you this place card - one side red and one side green so when you're ready for food, you flip the card to the green side & waiters will carry a huge slab of meat to your table.

When we arrived we were told to seat ourselves( myself and my boyfriend) okay. We sat a table, no tablecloths . The waitress came over with the drink menus and told us about the for pound option and unlimited but didn't really explain what each was. We went with the unlimited option, and I ordered a coconut caprihena (?) and for him passion fruit. The food at the ""salad bar"" was pretty fresh and tasted good, wish they had more options then they did. Meat was brought around to us at the table and overall it was pretty good although there were some meats that were super rare and others that were medium. There was also no pineapple brought while we were here. Compared to Brazilian grills I've been to, there were less options of meat brought out. The coconut caprihena was okay there were lots of little pieces of coconut that got into my mouth as I tried drinking it, wouldn't order again. The boyfriend's passion fruit caprihena was better than mine, and he also had 2 mango mojitos which were delicious. The waitress was good and made sure plates were taken away and waters were kept filled. Bill was around 93$ at the end of the night with the all you can eat option of food being 24.99Honestly this place was alright I may or may not return, or just drive farther to the Brazilian grill in Dartmouth which I believe is better.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Obrigado Oliveira's... what a lovely evening at your establishment. Â It was my husband's birthday and he had just seen the Phantom Gourmet sing the praise of this restaurant earlier in the day. He decided to chose Brazilian over Italian in the Northend. What a wise choice. Let me say not only is the food excellent but the staff is outstanding. Â That is a rare combination to find these days. Although we had a reservation our table wasn't ready when we arrived. Â The hostess was most apologetic and seated us as soon as possible. Here is where we met our server Maximo. Â The consummate professional. Friendly, informative and attentive to all our needs. Ladies I caution you unless you have been on a starvation diet for the past month I suggest you order by the pound. Men ... well just go for the All you can eat buffet because we know how you like a good steak. Â That you can have in every cut of beef imaginable. I highly recommend the Top Sirloin. The cordial manager stopped at our table and explained to us ""newbies"" how there are 8 chefs who each butcher, cook and serve their particular specialty. Now I know it will be a challenge but save room for one of their many delicious sweet treats. The desserts are beyond amazing! Â This place is a gem. We drove over an hour to get here. Trust me will be back and will be looking for Maximo to serve us again!!",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Went with a party of 3 on a Friday night in December. We all got the all you can eat.Good variety at the buffet to pair with the meat selections. Salad, fruits, rice, chicken, just to name a few. Decent meat options and the meats rotate fairly quickly.I would recommend the grilled pineapple with cinnamon. It's a nice treat included in the meat madness. Save room for dessert afterward. While it is not included in the all you can eat price, they do offer many options at a fair price.The staff was amazing. Quite possibly one of the best wait staff I ever experienced. They were all super friendly and helpful in explaining the fun concept. After a round or two the staff started to remember my favorite cuts of meat. It was our first time at a Brazilian buffet and I will definitely be back. Maybe will try the pay by the pound option next time since I learned what cuts of meat I like best.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"2,"My husband and I went on a Friday night and made a reservation for 7pm.We had their late Valentine's day special, AYCE with a bottle of wine for $80. For the price, this place was ok. They have a buffet table that had a variety of dishes that I do not typically see at a Brazillian BBQ place (fried rice, rice, curry, salmon, sushi, etc). I stuck with the typical veggies and some of the veggies looked a bit old, but in general the dishes tasted alright. I'm a bit disappointed in the meats themselves, although they were cooked decently (medium rare), it was very inconsistent in flavors. For the most part, each of the cuts were flavorless. What I love the most about Brazilian BBQ is the charred edges and salt and spices coated on the outside of the steak but it was Beverly lacking at this place. The only one that I did enjoy was the top sirloin. The service was attentive and there was always servers either bringing a new meat or cleaning up our plates. But, when I go to a Brazilian BBQ place, I'm really there for the meat and this place was a disappointment, I won't go back.",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"4,"First time at this Brazilian steakhouse. My family and Â I drove by this place a million times and finally had a chance to try it. The Rodizio is the way to go, especially if it's your first time at a Brazilian steakhouse. The Rodizio allows you to try all the different types of meat they have available! Our waiter was amazing and was so helpful in orienting us to the restaurant and how things worked there. The atmosphere was relaxing. There's less people in the early hours of dinnertime, but as the night got on, more and more people piled into the place and that's when the place became more lively and more busy. I liked how we got to reserve our table on Yelp and just walk right in to our reservation. I noticed a lot of people reserved their tables because the place gets packed real quick. The food was good, but the meat cutters should serve us meats that we want, pertaining to how we want our meat cooked, instead of cutting us meats that were too raw or too cooked for our taste. For the price we paid, I would definitely come again! Only this time I will prepare to eat lots of vegetables before coming to this restaurant, so that I can fill my belly with lots of meat! :)",Oliveira's Steak House,"120 Washington St Somerville, MA 02143"5,"I've eaten at Field and Vine a number of times since they first opened, but I have to reiterate my thoughts from my first review after my wonderful experience last night. To celebrate my graduation from graduate school, my boyfriend and I knew that Field and Vine would offer the perfect atmosphere. The hostess and waitstaff were so kind and accommodating of us, as we arrived without a reservation on a busy Saturday night. While sitting at our table, we overheard a couple sitting next to us remark that this restaurant is a little oasis in the city, and this characterization could not be more apt. We ordered the focaccia, as always, which came with a lemon-garlic tahini spread, the spiced carrots, which were the favorite of the night, the sweet potatoes, and the cast iron cheddar cornbread with a dollop of the slow roasted pork shoulder. While the menu is quite seasonal, if you happen to visit in the near future, we would highly recommend these dishes. We could not be more pleased that Field and Vine is part of our neighborhood!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"1,"Would recommend if you wanna post fancy food pics on instagram. Would NOT recommend if you have high standards for food. I went with two friends and asked for menu recommendations from our host. We ordered 6 tapas - fluke ceviche, focaccia with homemade butter and cranberry chutney, apple salad, beef tartare, napa cabbage and mushroom, and braised oxtails. To put it briefly - they put more efforts into plating than the food itself. The first four were cold plates. They were fine, and rather unimpressive. The fluke tasted sour but the meat was not very fresh and rather bland. Focaccia was actually warm and doughy, which was probably the highlight of the entire meal. Homemade butter recommended by the host was unspecial but the cranberry chutney was quite nice. Beef tartare and potato chips was okay. Apple salad had way too much vinegar in it and we couldnt finish. We didnt find much cabbage in napa cabbage and mushroom and it was mostly mushroom. I found it refreshing to add walnuts to the warm veggie plate. But, it was too salty and we couldnt taste the mushroom at all. The same problem with the oxtail - way too much salt. Maybe the chef was feeling particularly salty today, but it just ruined our meal and palate. We all drank like a liter of water during the meal. The date and parsnip cake afterwards was a more solid experience. In general, we only found the carbs - focaccia, potato chips, garlic bread and the crackers that served w/ ceviche satisfying. One common problem with all the dishes was that the flavor of the sauce and condiments was overwhelming, and the original flavor of the food was too faint. You dont want the condiments/sauce to overtake the food. The quality of the meal was definitely not worth its price. Even though the atmosphere was lovely and the host was friendly, the content of the restaurant is still hollow.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"I have been to Field & Vine twice in the past few months and both meals were exceptional. This place deserves much more buzz in the Boston restaurant scene. Drinks: The wine selection is solid. I really loved every glass I ordered.Food: Exquisitely executed shareable plates. Fire-roasted oysters. Ceviche. Braised oxtail. Even the turnips melt in your mouth. The dishes are creative and rich in flavor. I wanted to order everything and couldn't wait to taste what they brought out next.Ambiance: Possibly unlike anything in Boston. Warm, cozy, and inviting. Lots of wood and greenery, and an open fire at the heart of the space. Service: Friendly and knowledgeable. No complaints. This relatively new restaurant is a shining gem in the Boston/Cambridge restaurant scene. I can't wait to go back!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Fresh to the scene, Field and Vine, is a very nice addition to Union Sq. The interior feels like a forest oasis and the food is delicious. I was excited to see both olives and pickles on the snacks menu, two of my most favorite snacks EVER! The olives came out warm, which was unexpected, and to be totally honest, the olives were not great. In contrast, the pickles were fantastic. We then had an assortment of larger dishes. My favorites were the bluefish salad and the crispy chicken wings (you MUST get the chicken wings). The clams were unfortunately way too salty, we even sent them back. Overall, a solid 4 stars!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,Outstanding restaurant and reasonably priced which is a rare combination these days. I dine at a lot of great restaurants and this one is worthy of a visit if you're a foodie. I was a little surprised that we were able to get a table so easily but I suspect that once the word spreads it will no longer be the case. I'll definitely come back then next time I'm in the area.,Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Called in on a Saturday evening and scored a last minute reservation for dinner. The place was very cozy; walking in it felt like a little enchanted forest, with all the sparkling vines and flora floating around. There is an open kitchen so you get to watch all the magic happen. We started with a reasonably priced bottle of red, and ordered four plates to share. Notable were the fried chicken, which is unfortunately a special and may not be on the menu next time, and the cast iron cornbread. For dessert, the lavender pot de creme was wonderfully light and not too sweet. There was some time in between when they brought out each dish, but we didn't mind as we were taking our time to enjoy the food and wine, and didn't feel rushed at all.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"What a wonderful experience from beginning to end. Went here on Saturday night. Its down a small ally so you might miss it if you are not paying attention. The sign is very little. The restaurant is small so make sure you make reservation it was pretty crowded. The ambiance was wonderful. Great place to go on a cold winter night. The decorations were beautiful. The have a good selection of local breweries plus classic cocktails. The food was amazing it's Tapas style so lots of sharing. We got the stuffed peppers, The sausage, and the cornbread. The cornbread was out of this world. What a fun place to go and I will be back. If you area aware of Union Square. Parking is horrible so give yourself a ton of time to find a place or take Uber/Lyft.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Ok, did they just slaughter the cow out back and haul that juicy piece of meat in? I know it's farm to table, but everything here is fresher than fresh. It's seriously become one of my favorite restaurants in town, from the ""in the jungle, the mightly jungle, green and earthy, but in a classy Instagrammable hipster vibe way"" decor -- seriously, check out the amazing wooden fixture hanging above the bar -- to the incredible food. I love that they locally source all their food, and I believe make most if not all of their ingredients in-house (which may be a reason their bread is out of this world), and the owners / chef really highlights the ingredients in wonderful way. You walk away really understanding and appreciating the flavor profiles of individual ingredients in such a novel way. By getting back to basics, they make the concept of farm to table something everyone should try to really understand food as it was meant to taste.I ordered the curried cauliflower, and a whole bunch of other plates that I can't recall because I was savoring all the food like a flavor-drunk fangirl. But never fear, every dish I had here was incredible, so you can't go wrong with any plate here. Service was impeccable, and altogether, everything from the ambiance to the food and service was spot on. If my taste buds had pants, they would be charmed the eff off.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Small place. Â I like the atmosphere. Food is okay. Â But it's a open kitchen, the cooking smell hit the face as soon as get in the restaurant , and the smell also will leave on your hair and coat",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"4,"This place is wonderful and very consistent. They serve small (tapas) portions for sharing and recommend that for a party of 2 to order 3-4 items. We've come here two times already and enjoy their menu. I don't think they have anything bad on their menu.A few items that stand out for me are the blank bass crudo, Olives, fried chicken and the gnocchi. The prices are a bit high for the amount of food that's served. But it's worth it because all their items are fresh from the farm And served right to the table. They have a selection of oysters of the day but the offerings are limited and would recommend that you go somewhere else for oysters . Don't get me wrong I enjoy wellfleets and they had two others when o was there but for $3 each I would go somewhere else that has a better selection.For the food, ambiance and the service I am giving them four stars. I can't do five because although we got about 6 items we still left feeling hungry and I guess that's how it is sometimes when you're having farm to table foods.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Arrival: when my Lyft dropped me off, it wasn't clear where the entrance was, but it's actually down a little corridor to your right as you're driving into the parking lot/inlet. Look for a cute green door on your right. The interior is darling, lots of hanging plants, greenery, wood finishes, soft lighting, aka a hipster wet dream (in the best of ways). I was dining alone, so they offered me a seat at the bar, which ended up being a good thing as dining alone can be awkward sometimes and this way I had something to do - watching the kitchen team prep the food in their open kitchen. Now for the food:1. Focaccia, aka crack bread, seriously, the ratio of chewy to soft to salty was fantastic. I tried both the herbed creme frÃ¢iche and the house-made butter - go with the latter. The first honestly tasted a bit like a slightly thicker ranch or something. The butter is the real MVP here. 2. Next up were the grilled beets - omnomnom. The flavoring & texture of the beets and cheese were spot on (the cheese was a little more toasted in a few spots, aka a bit charred, but it was easy to pick around those bits). The basil was a little strange in the mix, but again, I picked around that & was fine. The peach purÃ©e was fire, I just wish there had been a smidge more of it. :)3. For the final act, I got the Cast Iron Cornbread - omg, so, so delicious. Everything complimented each other perfectly - the pork belly was cooked perfectly and pulled apart easily to pair in bites. The melding of the maple & chili flakes was a dance party for my taste buds. Do it. Get it.No dessert, sadly, as I was quite full by this point. Service throughout, from the hostess to server to the chefs, was top notch. Looking forward to visiting the next time I'm in the Boston area!n",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Loved our first visit to this spot. As mentioned, we started with the focaccia and homemade butter...yum! We were lucky enough to walk in without a reservation on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. Perfect view watching the chefs at work. Drink selection covers all the local brews and great wines. We had a maple chicken wing dish which left me drooling and split a broccli tart, a dish we can't stop talking about. We'll be back soon!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Absolutely wonderful! Got the burrata with sausage, beats with halloumi, littleneck clams, and miso-glazed snap peas. Everything was fresh and we watched them cook everything right in front of us. It was art. It was a little bit hot sitting by the wood fire where they were cooking things, so perhaps next time we won't go on a hot summer day. But we'll be back!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Boston. Everything we ate here, except for the clams, was exceptional. The ambiance is so warm and inviting and cozy. The food is incredible; there is a wonderful level of attention to almost every dish that makes the food here a delight to eat. Our favorite dish was probably the chicken wings, which are a Friday special. The next best thing was their hakurei turnip dish, which was the most exquisite root vegetable preparation I've ever had. The gnocchi was a tad too rich and cheesy for me, but I still enjoyed tasting it. The biggest and only disappointment were the clams; these were over salted and tasted awful. Unfortunately, they were perfectly prepared; juicy and not over cooked! We wish we could have enjoyed them.We finished the meal with the pot de creme which was so rich that it was perfect to be shared between two people. The turmeric and ginger tea with cinnamon and black pepper was also a delight. BTW Aesop hand soap in the bathroom... YOU KNOW THEY PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL! this place speaks to my soul.Overall, a really wonderful experience (minus the clams)... would definitely recommend to friends.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here with another couple who hailed it as quite amazing - and I'd say it lived up to the hype! The ambiance is very trendy-California with a sort of earthy vibe. Pretty good wine selection, but a little limited. The food is definitely worthy of praise - we ordered the focaccia and pickles to start. The bread was delicious and came with three spreads (house-made butter, tahini and an herbed creme frÃ¢iche) and the pickles were a nice blend of flavors. For mains, the menu is definitely best for sharing tapas style. As a vegetarian, there were plenty of meat-free options and actually one of those turned out to be a table favorite! We started with the delicata squash, carrots, radishes (with chicken liver pÃ¢tÃ©) and the chicken skewers. Then the second wave included the smoked sausage, crispy potatoes and the parisian gnocchi (which was everyone's favorite - so creamy!!!). Every item was delicious, but the standouts were the carrots, gnocchi and smoked sausage. I pressured everyone into sharing one desert and they were glad for it - the chocolate lavender pot de creme was just the right balance of bitterness and sweet to finish off the meal. Beyond the food, the staff was very attentive and friendly and it was charming to know that the owners are a married couple who were working together in the open kitchen. The wife came by to see how everything was and you could certainly see how her artistic personal style has translated into the food and presentation. A really lovely meal and we'll definitely be back again!",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"1,"I haven't written a review in years but I can't help but express my frustration and disappointment with the experience I had here. Like every other reviewer, I went with my boyfriend. The atmosphere is cozy and it's conveniently located next to backbar, (convenient ALSO because F&V doesn't have a liquor license). Most of the dishes are served lukewarm or cold (granted, we started off with oysters). The greens in the kale salad were gorgeous but overwhelmed by boquerones: which are much more pungent than anchovies and very, very fishy. I'm not sure why the carrots were prepared ""roasted and chilled"" when they would have been better served roasted to begin with. The accompanying sauce gribiche was pretty much an undersalted pat of egg salad and drowned out the fried capers and arugula. The sunchoke hummus was runny and came with dry crackers. It was ostensibly supposed to include a roasted fennel & onion relish but they forgot it I guess? The garlic meatballs & broth were perfectly salty and tender but I honestly can't believe we were suckered into spending $15 for 4 meatballs. The lamb sliders at Sarma are a STEAL comparatively, and consistently great. Â As I helped myself to a hefty glob of Aesop hand lotion in the bathroom I wondered whether we had merely ordered the wrong things. Did we somehow enter a Shallow Hal type of wormhole that distorted our entire sensory experience? Were we supposed to be too distracted by the wisteria vines to notice how much we were getting ripped off?",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Went to Field & Vine with two friends and we had a great dining experience. Plan on booking way ahead as it is very popular and getting a table between 6:20 and 8:30 is not easy! Our reservation was 8:30, booked a month in advance, and our table was ready for us within minutes of arriving. The decor is hipster industrial and the vibe is cheerful, youthful, and friendly. Â Service was excellent and the wine and food were great. We shared cornbread with a lemony butter, brussels sprouts with cabbage, smoky tofu, and walnuts (yum!), duck confit, and seafood mousseline. All were exceptionally good. This is a small plates restaurant and the plates are on the very small side (compared with other small plates restaurants like Sarma), so order accordingly. They serve only wine, beer, and cider, so as a cocktail lover I was a bit disappointed, but no biggie. The wine and beer selections are excellent. Â And parking in Union Square is next to impossible, but that's just the way it is. We lucked out with parking right in front(!) in the back alley where the door is.This is a well hidden gem of a restaurant and we'll definitely be back.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"The interior design is beautiful, inviting, cozy and lovely with a lot of carefully picked flowers and plants as well as delightful lights and kitchenware. The kitchen is an open space, you can see that the chefs use wood to cook and how they prepared and assembled your food.

I really like how chill and relaxed the chefs are which made the dining experience better.",Field & Vine,"9 Sanborn Ct Somerville, MA 02143"5,"We went as a big group the day after they reopened after Christmas break, first the ambient of the place was so cozy and beautiful, it has great tall ceilings and a big open space, the kitchen sits back of the room, the space is not too big that probably fits about 25-30 people and a few more around the bar/kitchen. The menu has almost a tapas feeling with a bit more portion. With first glance, the menu seems so fresh and lots of creative mixtures of veggies, such as parsley salad (have you ever had that as a main salad ingredient, and the dressing was just perfect). I think since we had a huge group we practically ordered everything on the menu. The 3 main meat dishes include the sausage, the steak, the pork and the fried chicken fried to awesome crispy and ridiculous flavoring without even any sauce required. The steak cooked perfect medium rare. The gnocchi was funky and delicious. For seafood lovers the tuna tartare was excellent again with some not too rich but tasty vinaigrette, also another seafood dish to consider the clam dish. Overall the experience was great, the food was so creative and innovative, for you veggie lovers (especially beets) you will love the place. And for everyone else the place has every kinda mixture that meet anyone's desire. And last but not the least, you have to try the pickled veggies...

The tuna is so soft and delicious. Every sauce is wonderful. And every combination of mixins is good as well. But when in doubt you can safely go by the pre-made options on the menu. Making a custom bowl is more of an advanced maneuver so slow down kid. One downside: the line moves so slow. I would advise staying away at prime time or if you're walking by and see a big line.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"2,"The food is delicious, but whoever runs this place needs to listen up. You could be doing two to three times the business, daily, with two more reliable employees on the line at peak times. I waited in line for forty minutes, the food was worth it but I shouldn't have been standing there as long while watching people walk out because of the wait. You're losing business and half of your employees were either late or on their phones in the back.That being said, the classic Hawaiian bowl was worth every single second of that wait. Get it together and you have a winner.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"3,"I ordered a large bowl through yelp. Because there's already $3.99 delivery charge, I only selected 10% tips through the App. The food arrived one hour and half later.

The food in the pictures looked good, thus the two stars.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I have a passion for Pokeworks! Why? Let me count it out for you.1. LOCATION! I live in Davis. And don't have a car. So when I get off the T/bus and want a healthier option that will fill me fast, Pokeworks is there.2. SPEED! Even if there's a line, you can walk through the door and out again with a bowl of fishy goodness in your hands in under 15 minutes.3. TASTE! The fish is so fresh, and you can pick the sauce that it's tossed in before it's added to your bowl. The toppings are varied and very well prepared. All of the flavors and textures mix together LIKE WOAH.3. STYLE! You can order from the menu or customize your bowl with a base, 2 proteins, as AS MANY TOPPINGS AS YOU WANT. A few like the avocado have an extra cost, but there are so many other options that come FO FREE that it's just fine. I like to do half salad/half brown rice as my base to lighten it up a bit, sushi grade salmon and tuna (with light spicy ginger sauce) as my proteins, and then GO TO TOWN with the dried seaweed, crabmeat salad, masago, seaweed salad, and even crunchy toppings like the lovely lotus chips (add one in for the pic, even if you don't want to eat it -- trust me!).4. AFFORDABLE! A regular bowl comes out to around $11, which I think is very reasonable considering the quality, quantity, and variety of all you can add to your bowl as well as the speedy and attentive service. I can usually make one bowl into two meals, so in this case it's especially a steal! If you plan on coming often, make sure to get a regards punch card because with every 12 bowls purchased, you get a free regular poke! And with that, Pokeworks has poked it's way into my heart.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Quick service, great prices, and deliciously fresh fish. The salmon here is so soft and melts in your mouth! Mango is juicy and flavorful, rice is so soft and sticky, and the nori wrap has a moderate presence but holds the burritos very well together. This is arguably one of the better places for poke in the Boston area and the line moves quickly (similar to Chipotle). There is a bit of seating indoors but there's a nice eating area outdoors if you take a quick walk toward the train station.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"When Pokeworks first opened up, I've heard that the lines stretched around the block and that the wait time could go over a hour! Now that the hype has lessen some, I decided to try it out. There was no wait around 8PM on a Saturday night.Like most poke places, you can either pick from a variety of poke bowls on the menu, or build your own bowl from what you see in the counter. I opt for a Regular sized poke at $10.95 (Two choices of protein).Protein Choices available: Ahi Tuna (Fresh), Salmon (Spicy/Fresh), Shrimp, Scallop, Chicken, Organic TofuMine was a combo of: 50/50 Sushi Rice and Spring Mix base with ... Fresh Salmon, Hijiki and Ogo seaweed, Chopped Shiso, Fresh jalapeno, Cilantro. For flavor, I went with Sriracha Aioli. My bowl was topped with Seaweed salad, pickled ginger, green onions, garlic crisps and masago.I really liked how they had the proteins mixed separately in a metal bowl before topping it on your base at the very end. The salmon chunks were pretty unevenly cut, but were fresh nevertheless. You are asked if you want a light/medium/heavy dressing and I went with medium, which I think is more than enough sauce for the bowl. Ask them to go a little lighter on the crispy toppings if you want to avoid having a jaw workout during your meal. Will definitely return to try other flavors!",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Took the plunge and came out here (with the help of some good 'ol peer pressure from friends) for Sunday lunch. Â Davis square can be a hassle when it comes to parking. Â No other option aside from cruising around in a circle until someone leaves (or do what I did and camp the parking lot for people returning from their errands). Â The interior is very spacious and clean and the tables are nice and wide (though there aren't as many chairs for seating as you would think with all this space). Â I opted for the Hawaiian classic poke burrito and found it quite tasty. Â The combination of flavors worked well for me (very fresh!) and did not leave me feeling heavy at all.

I wanted to wait a couple months after their opening to avoid that crazy line out the door. The regular size bowls consist of 2 protein options, and a large allows you to have 3. The bowls are definitely more on the pricey side, but they are quite generous with their portions, so in a way, it makes up for it. They offer mix-ins, toppings, flavor, and crunch! My boyfriend and I got similar bowls because we basically have the same taste. We each ordered a large bowl with 3 proteins (salmon, ahi tuna, and more tuna!!), along with sushi rice and a salad. We had the kale, cucumber, diced mango, and orange slices for our mix-ins. For our sauces (the ""flavor""), we asked for Umami Shoyu and Sriracha Aioli. Our toppings were crab salad, green onion, masago (fish eggs), and seaweed salad. And FINALLY, we added some garlic and onion crisps for that extra CRUNCH! As you can see, we filled our bowls to the very top! The only thing I wish they had was EEL! I like that Love Art Sushi offers eel as a protein option. Nevertheless, if I had to choose between Love Art Sushi and Pokeworks, I'd give my vote to Pokeworks because of their excellent quality and variety of options. Please open a store in Chinatown/Downtown :)",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I wanted to come back and give some more details on why Pokeworks is amazing~ I've tried so many poke places in the area and I've gotta say Pokeworks is still one of my favorites. I always get tuna or salmon here as my protein and their tuna/salmon is consistently fresh. For those who want other options, there's shrimp and spicy salmon as more unconventional protein. Great unlimited toppings with classics like seaweed salad, crab salad, and more. Typically, going through the line, I'll get salad/greens with edamame, mango, both seaweeds, seaweed and crab salad and onion crisps. Finished off with a medium amount of bright ponzu sauce! I like the choice between pre-made bowls (that you can add toppings to as well!) and make your own bowl fun. Great selections, always fresh, and so tasty! 10/10",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Poke doesn't get better than this! This was our last meal of a vacation in Boston and it was fresh af and made my Poke dreams come true.This is a fast casual spot right in Davis Square and there are tons of options for even the pickiest of poke fans. There are pre-set items on the menu, but you can also make your own! The guy behind the counter recommended making your own Poke bowl for the best experience. So, I listened and began my journey to fresh fish wonder.The large bowl affords you 3 proteins, so I did a mix of tuna and spicy salmon. On to the toppings. Woah are there toppings. Wakame, Edamame, Mango, Tobiko, all sorts of glorious mix and match items. Then come the sauces - there's a plethora of those, too!There's even a crunch bar for added flavor. The large poke bowl is large enough for two people to share for lunch. Or for one person to have leftovers later!You can also order pick up via the Yelp App which is perfect for a busy day!",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Nice place, very good food! Minus a star because it's a bit expensive and the employees put too little sometimes. Would come back though.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"1,"What an awful restaurant. The employees act like they hate their lives, and one even refused to speak to me! After putting the wrong items on my $13 wrap, they forgot to cut it, and served one of my items to-go, and one for here. This place is a pathetic excuse for a restaurant and I would highly recommend no one allows these careless employees around raw fish. They couldn't care less. I'll never go back.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"My first time here and I got the custom poke bowl-- white rice, 2 choices of protein: I got shrimp and ahi tuna, and all the toppings you want. I think I got both kinds of seaweed because one was sweet and the other salty, adds a nice crunch to the poke. Other toppings I got were edamame, cilantro, mango, nori strips, garlic crisps, onion crisps, ginger, and wasabi. They have different options for dressing and I think I ended up choosing some sort of sesame vinaigrette. The poke bowl came together nicely and I enjoyed it very much. I also ended up getting some sort of tea, can't remember the name. It was good but would probably pick something else next time.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"When I visited my bf in MA, we ate here two times in two days haha. I've first had PokÃ©works in NYC so the food wasn't new to me, but it was still delicious. This location is spacious and clean, and the food was of course fresh!You can choose from:- Signature bowls which are pre-fixed dishes- Build your own--I personally like to build my own so I can add whatever my heart desires!- Poke bowl, burrito, and salad- Small (2 choices of protein, $10.95) and large (3 choices of protein, $13.50)I love how everyone can personalize their own poke bowls. All of the sauces, the crunch (garlic crisps are my favorite), and the delicious fish! If you've never tried poke, definitely give this place a try!",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"I made my own poke bowl coming here and it was the best creation I've made. Small is $10.45 (2 choices of protein) Large is $13.50 (3 choices of protein). They have SO many choices for what you can put inside your bowl. Everything is laid out, exactly like when you go to chipotle, best visualization I can give.Here's a break down of what I got: spicy salmon, shrimp, scallops, brown rice, kale noodles, cilantro, cucumbers, fresh jalapenos, diced mangos, sweet onion, sriracha aioli in medium for spice, green onions, garlic crisps, onion crisps and crab salad.The restaurant was clean, service was quick and they have plenty of long tables to sit in.I completely fell in love with this place! Everything I got was so fresh and tasty. Avocado lovers- its $1.50 to add it, similar to other places. Don't worry, there are few, very rare items that are only a little extra. There is a lot more toppings that are free. All the prices were reasonable and completely worth it. As you can see my bowl was packed nicely and that made me very happy. You can count on me being a regular here!",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"I am a big fan of pokebowls, so I came here with high expectations/hopes.

Perhaps I can try it again.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Food is great, although it will be likely better if the rice is not that hot.

I will likely never go back again during lunchtime, despite food and price both being good.",Pokeworks,"261 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"5,"Best shawarma ever. Period. I usually order delivery from here, it's more of a takeout place. The delivery is always before or on time, the food is amazing and it's cheap as well. Love love love their garlic sauce. Wish they sold it separately so I could stock up on it :PTip: get the noor works, best value for money",Noor Mediterranean Grill,"136 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Tasty and reasonably priced. The shop is fairly small, but clean. They seem to get a lot of delivery orders and takeout, which makes sense. Sitting near the window gives a surprisingly nice view of the adjacent Nathan Tufts Park. Food came out quick, and the price was not bad for the portion sizes. I ordered the chicken kabab wrap with garlic sauce and all the toppings. Everything tasted fresh and well-seasoned, and the garlic flavor really complemented the chicken. My friend had the beef Noor Works wrap (tahini sauce), which is the shawarma with a side of fries. Not sure why the chicken kabab doesn't have a ""works"" version with fries, but there was plenty to share regardless. The beef shawarma was even better than the kabab, and had just the right touch of saltiness. Fries wise, pretty good. They had a nice crunchy outside, but felt a little less flavorful, though entirely enjoyable. Both wraps were quite big, and left us stuffed afterwards. All told, a great little place for some simple Mediterranean fare. Try the Noor Works with beef, and you won't be disappointed.",Noor Mediterranean Grill,"136 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"We decided to enter this establishment as a means to indulge in our infinite curiosity of the Mediterranean culinary arts. We walked through the brisk Somerville weather and found ourselves in a store that was cramped but welcoming. It was here that we knew our destinies would be changed forever: another establishment we could frequent. We ordered two Noor plates, one with chicken and one with beef that comes with french fries. However, we found ourselves forced to purchase drinks, there was no free water. We sat there parched until we finally succumbed to the capitalistic greed of our society. The french fries were admittedly quite homely, they lacked a certain je ne sais quoia -- quite bland but still tasteful. The food was amazing. Five stars for the food. Absolutely deloncolous portions and meat. We are lovers of meat. 10/10 would recommend. -MHKTRL",Noor Mediterranean Grill,"136 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"We had our son's baptism reception meal catered with Noor, and we're very pleased with the food and service! We had about 80 people, and no one left hungry. So many people came up to me to ask where we had gotten our food, or to tell me how delicious everything was. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food we received, and the meat was perfectly moist.

Thanks for a great event!",Noor Mediterranean Grill,"136 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"First time customer, I ordered delivery via Yelp. The food came fast (20 min earlier than stated), hot and fresh! Got a chicken shawarma wrap with hummus, tomato, lettuce, onion (those options were at no additional cost), and fries. Literally first time I've ever gotten delivered fries hot and crispy! The food was VERY generously portioned, couldn't finish it all for lunch (my photo only captures 3/4 of the wrap). It was more meat than I wanted but I can say you'll get your money's worth. Â For what it was, it was very healthy-- not oversalted, juicy chicken, fresh veggies. It wasn't the best tasting marinade I've had in a shawarma but still good and I'd come again to try their other options, or for a satisfying delivery experience. Also note it was $1.50 delivery with minimum $10 purchase, pretty good deal for the area.",Noor Mediterranean Grill,"136 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"4,"Sold! So, you want to hear something embarrassing?

Why would Lee eat the same thing for almost 3 days straight? Because it's THAT Â goooooooooooood. That's why! They have the best falafel I've ever tasted! They also make their Falafel with Foul mudammas which is one of the better ways to make it. The crust... OMG! Crispy... Crunchy... I feel like a Butterfinger commercial. Then you bite into it and taste the soft fluffy filling (one moment, I'm having Falafel flashbacks right now). Their hummus is great also and the garlic sauce is similar to my family recipe, but it needs a little lemon in my opinion. The grape leaves are tasty but cost $1.50 PER leaf Â (a bit steep for my liking).Otherwise, the food is bomb.com. Very fresh. Super tasty. Great portions. And the pickled veggies are the perfect touch.

However, I've had better in the area. We arrived at 9pm on a Thursday night. When a chicken shawerma plate was ordered, the man informed us that the chicken had already run out for the day. We could get beef shawerma or kebabs. Beef it is then. We also got a falafel plate. Maybe it was an off night, but both the beef shawerma and falafel balls were a bit off. The beef was dry and lacking flavor. The falafel were overly fried, making them heavy and very hard to cut. The fries and salad were nothing special. The rice was pretty good, as were the hummus and YES to the tangy garlic sauce (although be warned: your breath WILL still smell like it the next day). It was also very hot inside, as there is no A/C and just one fan running in the back. And there's no tap water available (you can only buy bottles), so I wouldn't necessarily eat inside again. A good option would be to get it to-go and eat outside in Powderhouse Park. But a better option would be to just go somewhere else.",Noor Mediterranean Grill,"136 College Ave Somerville, MA 02144"5,"The food is tasty, fresh and feels healthy. It's always pretty consistent, I've had the steak shawarma, chicken swarma, and chicken kabob. All are good options depending on what you're in the mood for. Â Sometimes the swarma can be a tad dry, but still tender and flavorful. Extra star for great customer service. They made a mistake on my delivery order and it took over 90 minutes to arrive.

Â The atmosphere on the back patio is beautiful. Â This was one of those places where you can close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and you will never be disappointed. Â The fatteh (spelling?) was INCREDIBLE. Â Was possibly thinking about ordering another one and skipping dessert - it was THAT good.This is a restaurant you need to visit if you remotely like Mediterranean food.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"This place is UNBELIEVABLE, probably one of the best meals I've had in a long, long time. Conde Nast had this spot on their ""best in the world 2015"" list and it consistently ranks highly as a top spot for vegetarians. I can see why. For starters, make a reservation. The place isn't very big and it's pretty popular, especially during the summer, because they have a pretty extensive outdoor eating area. We went on a Wednesday night around 7pm, and waited for about a half hour prior to getting seated. They kindly got us drinks and some small plates while we waited for our table. They don't serve hard alcohol, but have a very extensive list of wines and champagne, and also make fun, seasonal, wine-based drinks.I believe the menu rotates, but I think some of the popular dishes are always available. We probably ordered about 3-4 plates per person (table of 6) which came out to be a bit much, and resulted in food getting wasted at the end of the night.Everything was EXCEPTIONAL. The standouts were definitely the Whipped Feta, Fatteh, Lemon Chicken, and Lamb Lamejun. The pita was great as well. My personal favorite was either the stuffed shells or the falafel. I LOVE falafel and this might be the best I've ever had. Warm, crunchy, tasty and soft, all at once. That is a must-have.Bottom line: I haven't been to Giacomo's, in fairness, but I have been to Lolitas and Atlantic. This place takes the cake for me as best in Boston. 200% will be back.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"3,"This is my favorite restaurant. Start with the Feta and Pepper Spread. Always go with the Vegetarian Dinner. I'm not a Vegetarian, but the dishes included in this dinner are always spectacular. If you can save room for dessert, the Baked Alaska is phenomenal. The passion fruit touch is genius. The service here has never been anything less than professional, yet at the same time, warm and gracious. Updated Review 07/31/18A friend of mine was visiting Boston last week. I highly recommended Oleana, and they decided to visit on Tuesday night 7/24. They only had time for one ""date night"" during their visit. They trust me with my Restaurant recommendations, and I even advised them to order the vegetarian dinner, as I had always ordered it and it was beyond fantastic. When they returned from their trip, I asked about their dinner. They hesitated, and told me that their dinner was a disappointment. Their food was very ""Ok"", but nothing beyond that. I was flabbergasted and embarrassed that I had recommended it! They could have gone anywhere. I was perplexed by this, and couldn't imagine how their dining experience could have been so mediocre. I realized that it had been a few years since I visited the Boston area. In that time, could the restaurant have gone downhill? Surely Ana Sortun couldn't possibly have been cooking that night! One of the waiters suggested to them that it depended on who was cooking. Really?!?? Is it the management of the place? What has happened to my previously very Favorite Restaurant???? I know this. I will be hesitant to recommend it in the future. I'm so sorry that this restaurant is obviously experiencing problems concerning quality. Such a shame",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"4,"Had reservations for 7 P.M. We arrived a little early and were quickly sat in a nice, secluded table in the corner. The special ran out at 7, a few minutes after or waitress told us about it. That was a gut punch. The house bread was seasoned with za'atar and came with olive oil. It is an acquired taste. Some may not like it, especially since it is cold. It had a similar texture to cornbread. We were served three pieces but only ate two. The food started coming out soon after or order was taken. Our water was filled repeatedly, and we were checked on several times. The way the dishes were explained to us as they came out one after another reminded me of omakase sushi. The first dish that came out was the fatteh. Caramelized Onion, Cauliflower, Crispy Mushrooms, Pinenuts, Yogurt. It was nice and warm with a variety of textures and flavors. It contained many ingredients that were skillfully combined and worked well together. This was my favorite dish of the night. Next came the spinach falafel. Tahini Sauce, Beet Yogurt, Cress. We were asked if we wanted four falafel sandwich instead of three since there were two of us. That was thoughtful. This wasn't as good as the fatteh, which was a very hard act to follow. The pickled vegetables added to it by breaking up the taste a little. I got this due to the very many positive reviews about it on yelp but was not impressed. Next was the squid Kokorec. Garlic Bread, Green Chile, Cherry Tomato, Cumin, Oregano. The squid was perfectly cooked. I liked it a lot, and I don't really like squid or pesto. I would get this again. Finally, we had the Sultan's delight. Tamarind Beef, Smokey Eggplant PurÃ©e, Pinenuts. This one took a long time to come out. When it was brought out the server had three more of them to deliver to other diners. Perhaps there is something about the way that it is prepared that takes time. It reminded me of bbq. Very tender, melt in your mouth. There were some super tasty fatty parts too. I would also get this again. This was another dish that many on yelp recommended. Our server then patiently explained the dessert menu. Went with the goat milk ice cream. Roasted Strawberry, Persian Love Cake, Almond, Strawberry MarasMallow. I liked the taste of the ice cream. It was quite refreshing. The almonds were good too. Don't eat this yourself. It is suited for two. The cake part of the dessert seemed a little too sweet. I would not get this again. Based on other yelp reviews and my own personal experience, dessert may be their weak point. We really enjoyed our experience at Oleana. The service was second to none, and the food very tasty and daring. I recommend doing what we did and just ordering mezes. We got four and a dessert, and that was more than enough for us.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"Oleana Restaurant was the most expensive restaurant I visited during my short weekend trip to Boston and I gotta say it was worth every penny. Executive Chef Ana Sortun is a six-time James Beard semifinalist for Outstanding Chef & also won the Best Chefs in America award in 2005. In addition, Executive Pastry Chef Maura Kilpatrick is a seven-time James Beard semifinalist for Outstanding Pastry Chef. You heard it - two James Beard nominees all under one restaurant! I booked a table through the Reserve platform three weeks ahead of time and got 8 PM time slot, but their bar seats and garden patio are first-come, first-served. After we arrived to the restaurant, the staff seated us within the next five minutes. You know the restaurant is really popular when chefs write and sell their own cookbooks (e.g. ""Soframiz: Vibrant Middle Eastern Recipes from Sofra Bakery and Cafe""). There are so many items on the menu that I felt pretty overwhelmed, but luckily the bottom of the menu got a glossary to explain certain dishes and Yelp review highlights were also extremely helpful.***Complimentary bread: Tasted slightly funky, and I am not exactly a fan. However, save some bread just in case you are still hungry at the end of the meal. Save your stomach for their Ã  la carte items!Spinach Falafel (Tahini Sauce, Beet Yogurt, Cress - $13): You get three of these heavenly falafel! This dish simply took the entire flavor profile to the next level - creamy texture combining with very distinct aroma = one delicious experience!Sultan's Delight (Tamarind Beef, Smokey Eggplant PurÃ©e, Pinenuts, $15): The level of tenderness and melt-in-your-mouth level were absolutely unreal. I could probably finish the entire dish in two bites, but I did the exact opposite - I savored every bite.Lemon Chicken (Za'atar, Turkish Cheese Pancake, $27): The quality of chicken was unbelievable - moist and tender chicken!!! Yes cream cheese tasted a bit greasy, but the entire chicken skin was covered with a layer of Za'atar and Za'atar created this unique flavor profile that you simply can't find in most other Mediterranean restaurants.Grilled Pita (Red Pepper, Pomegranate Molasses, Nigella Seed, $3): A bit like mini flatbread pizza without any cheese and toppings.Warm Buttered Hummus (Basturma, Tomato, $6): Potato-like texture with a hint of star anise flavor. I thought hummus was okay and it was the least memorable order of the night.***Overall it was an eye-opening dinner and I feel like each dish had its own unique characteristics and personality. The three dishes (Spinach Falafel, Sultan's Delight, Lemon Chicken) are essentially must order items and don't commit too many orders because lemon chicken was very filling (consider sharing just one entree so you'll have room for desserts). Sadly I was too full and did NOT get to try their famous Baked Alaska (with Coconut Ice Cream and Passion Fruit Caramel). This is hands down one of the best Mediterranean restaurants that I have ever tried.P.S. - Oleana also has two sister restaurants called SOFRA Bakery & Cafe and Sarma in the Boston area.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"I went seafood crazy on this trip to Boston, but this was a nice break from lobster rolls and oysters. It is a celebration of Mediterranean and Arabic cooking that takes you all over with a great assortment of mezze. We had a cute corner table near the wine bottles in the corner and shared 4 plates and a dessert. The server suggested 4-6 and I would agree. The olive oil laden bread with za'atar was wonderful and the quality of the oil was spectacular. I was excited for the meal. They had a shrimp mezze that was sold out, but I opted to sub the kefte-I was not disappointed. This was the shining dish of the night despite the rave reviews for sultan beef and spinach falafel. It was tart, soft, crunchy-just an unbelievable dish. I wanted a second one, but more was coming. The falafel were nice in texture and the beet purÃ©e was sweet, but it wasn't my favorite and tasted lightly seasoned after the kefte flavor bomb. The next item was the squid. This squid was delicious with a light sauce of olive oil and saffron with cherry tomato. The sauce was heavenly and the texture of the squid could not have been better. The sultan beef dish followed and it was the most surprising. It tasted like sweet beef barbecue. Seriously. It was soft and coated in a sweet/tangy glaze and was melt in your mouth tender-but it tasted like a really good bite of BBQ beef. I will let my bf handle the dessert review, but I will say-if you see something with goat cheese ice cream, get it. So delicious.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"Delicate appetizers and ambrosial main courses.We had the lamb tarts and the beef one to start with(I can't remember the name). The beef appetizer is great. The beef itself is very soft. It is not like a ""steak"". You don't need knives to slice it. Just pull it apart with forks.The lamb tarta has a little spicy taste. In addition, they add some flour product inside the tarta. It tastes like small pieces of pasta which makes the lamb meat more outstanding.For the main course, scallop is definitely a good choice. Most places overlook scallops so that they become chewy and hard to swallow. However, the scallops here are like soft jellies. We had the classic dessert ""Baked Alaska"". The well scorched marshmallow contains a scoop of ice cream and a piece of cake inside. They use passion fruit sauce at the base to provide a sour taste in order to neutralize the sweetness.The only deficiency is that the bread and the veggie side we had are too salty and bitter.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"Oleana is such a beautifully done restaurant with wonderful food and service. To be honest, it was the first time I've had this type of Mediterranean food and I was pleasantly surprised. The menu has a combination of small tapas-style plates and entree plates. We opted for the small tapas (meze) to try more foods.They suggested 2-3 a person and we were happy to oblige.+SULTAN'S DELIGHT: Â The beef is incredibly soft and flavorful. It comes with a basil leaf on top and I would definitely recommend having parts of the leaf with the beef. It goes so well together.+FATTEH: A really great combination of flavors. I especially like the crispiness of the ""bread,"" and in combination with the other ingredients make it quite texturally pleasing. The crispy mushrooms and caramlized onions give it a savoriness that compliments the yogurt. +SPINACH FALAFEL: The falafel is so moist and crispy on the outside, and the tart beet yogurt is a perfect condiment.+VERMONT QUAIL KEBOB: Softest quail I've had, though I should preface I haven't had many. The rice is slightly crispy on the bottom which adds a nice texture.-BAKED ALASKA: I haven't had too many but not sure if you could go wrong with this. While the menu says the ice cream inside is coconut, it didn't seem that way to me. Furthermore, the passionfruit syrup tasted almost too sweet but it worked out okay with the rest of the dish (just don't eat it on its own). I'm a fan of different temperatures of my food and this was no exception with the warm meringue and cold ice cream. -WARM BUTTERED HUMMUS: My least favorite but it wasn't bad. The hummus is not the hummus that I'm used to, and on the drier side (kind of reminded me of bean paste texture of Asian desserts). The restaurant seems popular and I would recommend reservations, though it seems that people can get lucky if you go right at opening. As for the restaurant itself, the tables are a little close together, and the bathroom is small, but not in an off putting way. They also have an outside area that's open when weather-permitting. As a walk-in, we got seated here, though a warning that it gets pretty dark out there. All in all, Oleana was a great experience and I would not hesitate to return. Definitely a gem of Boston!",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"4,"We dined at Oleana on a Thursday night and it was packed! Reservations always recommended here.My biggest let down is that they don't have a liquor license so they only serve beer and wine. However, our waitress was very pleasant and the food was great. We weren't overly hungry so we chose 3 mezzes to share. We had the quail kebabs which were awesome, the moussaka which was even better, and a special carrot soup with a fish cake. Those 3 were plenty to fill us both and it was all delicious.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"I can never praise Oleana enough. My husband and I rented out Oleana last May to host our wedding. Throughout the entire process they were extremely accommodating, communicative, and knowledgeable. More importantly we have an extremely limited budget, and found Oleana, one of the BEST restaurants in the Boston area, to be more affordable than many other venues and caterers. Space Fee is $1,500. Family-Style Menu is $65 per guest. Â All of my guests left complimenting the food. So, needless to say if you haven't dined at Oleana yet I'd recommend making a reservation and getting in as soon as you can. The garden patio is my favorite spot in the summer. If you are food curious, I'd recommend making a meal out of Â mostly mezes (think tapa size) with perhaps just 1 entree for a protein option. The menu changes a bit throughout the seasons. Â However my favorites are the Spinach Falafel, any octopus/duck variation, Sultan's Delight, and any borek. Even for tradition items that might not excite you give it a try at Oleana because I've found they prepare the dishes with really interesting twists and surprising combination of flavors. Also, I'm equally obsessed with they sister restaurants Sarma and Sofra!",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"We love Oleana so much we chose it as the venue for our wedding. The back patio in summer is full of flowers and feels intimate and private for Cambridge. Plus we knew the food would be AMAZING.We worked with Oleana's event coordinator Jenna. Â She was welcoming and helpful, and supportive and charming and went above and beyond to make sure our wishes, including some special requests, were met. Â Once things were planned we got to meet the rest of the staff, who were also wonderful. On the day of the event the kitchen turned out an truly memorable meal Â ( people new to Oleana were blown away) and made sure everyone got lots to eat - even those courses where people asked for seconds...and thirds. Â Those who've had Ana's Sultan Delight understand.We would recommend Oleana as a function destination to anyone planning a special event.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"This restaurant was fabulous! Excellent food-great staff- wonderful ambience (inside and outside). The lemon chicken was delicious! Do not miss this one if you are in Cambridge. We will be back. Thank you Sara, Jason and to the host who so kindly fit us in when we made the reservation for the wrong night.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"This place is stellar. The food is inventive, delicious, and also pretty fun. Ana Sortun's restaurants are all worth going, in my opinion, and this one is no exception. It's a particularly good spot for vegetarians, as they even have a vegetarian-specific tasting menu.When I go, I'm usually so excited about the mezzes that I skip an entree altogether. That way, I can enjoy as many different flavors as possible. The Sultan's Delight and the Lamb and Grape Leaf Tart are two of my favorites.If you're there in the summer, ask to sit in the backyard! It's first-come, first-served so if you get there early, you'll be more likely to get a spot there.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,Everything was great! This is probably one of the best restaurants in the whole Greater Boston Area!,Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"Oleana is one of the rare restaurants that never fails to disappoint me in every aspect. First, the restaurant is truly Turkish: the decorations, the music, the table settings, everything. I know the owner personally, and I know she travels to turkey periodically throughout the year and makes a true effort to ensure oleana's authenticity. Next, the food is incredible!! Every single meze plate is delectable, and the dessert is incredible. If you come to oleana, be ready to eat because every dish on the menu is worth ordering. I love coming here, and I will keep coming back!",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"Take the review with a grain of salt, since we didn't eat lunch or dinner here. But the atmosphere was warm and welcoming when my partner and I visited late evening for dessert! We sat at the bar and marveled at the drink and dessert menus!After ordering the baked alaska and watching it be prepared through the window to the kitchen, we were so impressed! The taste was amazing and unique! The outside was a little crunchy but light and fluffy on the inside! Underneath, the toasted coconut ice cream was hiding! SO GOOD. The dessert was on a plate with a ring of passionfruit sauce at the base. The flavor was a little strong/sour/tart to me, but I easily avoided it. My partner absolutely LOVED the sauce, though, so it worked out! Already craving more, but I also long to explore the menu! We will be back soon!",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"3,"The patio was incredible and the food was lovely, no complaints! I just wished the portion was larger coming from that price. 3 stars because our waiter's attitude was like ""I am having a bad day and you better don't mess with me"" attitude. Not sure if she was only acting like that to our table.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"4,"This place is really knows their food. I came here for dinner and the waitress had something to say about almost everything in the menu. You can order and entree here but there also have a section for small plates/tapas style.I ordered the spinach falafel and it was delicious! The spinach and beet sauce go really good with the warm, fresh falafel.The atmosphere is more that casual so it's perfect or a little date night!",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"Visited from Atlanta, Oleana most definitely lived up to its hype. Our waitress walked us through the different ways to order (e.g. all small plates vs 2 small plates per person and a shared main course vs. each get a main course and share an appetizer), and since all the appetizers sounded so amazing, we decided to go four 4 small plates and then share a main.We tried the sultan's delight, lamb and grape leaf tart, octopus, and a soft shell crab special, and then split the chicken. Everything was fantastic, with multiple layers of complex flavors ranging from sweet to savory. The sultan's delight and soft shell crab stole the show though - the sultan's delight was a tender, fruit glazed short rib, paired with a fantastic whipped dip, and the soft shell crab had this incredible fruit and tahini salad that it came with. Delicious. We were practically licking the plate. While the octopus and lamb and grape tart were good, they just didn't have the same effect on us. The octopus was actually a little salty for my liking, and I love salt.The lemon chicken was also delicious, and the zaatar seasoning was great. The meat was served on top of a rich, feta stuffed crepe that still tasted light and refreshing despite being anything but a ""light"" component.The only thing that left us a bit unsatisfied was the service - while it was great at the beginning, we started feeling very rushed and as though we were being shoved out the door by the time we were finishing up our main course. While I understand how busy the restaurant is, when you have people paying a decent amount to dine at your establishment, you shouldn't be grabbing plates left and right and hustling for the check to be paid so that you can get the next people in...NOTES:(1) Be sure to make a reservation because theres always a wait even after.(2) If you are a vegetarian this place is for you. Â They have a vegetarian tasting menu.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"3,"Four of us had dinner here recently and overall I feel a little disappointed. Based on the reviews I was probably coming into it with unrealistic expectations but as my review will detail, I have my reasons.My wife and I got there about 15 minutes prior to our reservation time, and were waiting for our friends. While we waited it would have been nice to have a drink at the bar, but apparently they only allow people in the bar area based on the number of seats, so we were told we could wait on a bench that's next to a server station. They did get us drinks from the bar, so it wasn't too bad. One thing I didn't know was that they only serve beer and wine - no hard liquor. We were sat at a table and soon had placed orders for a number of mezes, followed by a couple of entrees. The mezes ranged from delicious to merely meh. The grilled pita with red pepper, pomegranate molasses, and nigella seed was a soggy, cold plate of pita covered in red liquid that didn't seem grilled or taste of pomegranate. The warm buttered hummus was very good, the quail was ok, the moussaka was excellent. It should be noted that these mezes are really small, about two bites, other than the pita, so you don't have much to share. We also got one of the specials of the night, which was left unfinished.Entrees were scallops and gyros. Small, nicely plated, but underwhelming in flavor. I think the restaurant is a bit full of themselves. There's a lot of very good food, but it seems to be matched by dishes that aren't very good. It may be the execution or the concept of some of these lesser dishes, I'm not sure which but with the expectations set by the restaurant itself and the reviews, it all seemed like a bit of a let down. Service was ok. Some servers were better than others and it was a bit scattered as far as who was taking care of us. At least 4 different people brought out plates or removed them. We had to point out several times that the empty beer cans could be taken, which seemed obvious as they were crowded together on the edge of the table.One other thing, which wasn't an issue for us but could be for anyone in a wheelchair, is that the bathrooms are tiny - absolutely not ADA compliant. Kinda surprised by this as Cambridge is supposedly a bastion of equality and such.",Oleana Restaurant,"134 Hampshire St Cambridge, MA 02139"5,"A hidden gem: it's like your mom is Moroccan and a really good cook.

Â Will go again",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"We visited a second time and it was just a fantastic as our first visit. I highly recommend this place, if looking for good Moroccan food. We were in the Somerville area shopping for furniture and happened upon this place via yelp. We love Moroccan food and definitely wanted to check it out. Â We were very impressed with the place. The food was great and the service very friendly. For starters, we ordered the chicken Bastilla appetizer, a phyllo dough pastry stuffed with chicken, almonds, and seasoning topped with some powdered sugar. This thing was fantastic. We highly recommend ordering this. We also ordered the carrot salad starter also quite good.For entrees we both ordered the m-roustia. A lamb shank tajine with almonds, raisins, sesame seeds, and spices. Â Again it was fantastic. We ended up breaking up the bread and soaking up the sauce in the tajine. I would definitely order again.Staff are very friendly. I will point out that they do not have many staff members. If it is busy and you are in a big hurry, this may not be the place to visit. We will definitely be back when in the Somerville area again. I highly recommend if you are in the mood for Moroccan food.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Oh I'm so glad I found this place.

Without knowing exactly what would be authentic, this certainly feels authentic to me, in decor, food quality, and hospitality, not to mention being a very relaxed atmosphere.Your meal begins with nicely steeped mint tea, bread, and a dish of brined cabbage. The food, which came out quickly this evening, was what I expected in terms of texture and taste. Our chicken bastilla appetizer had that combination of texture including ground almonds, the fruity undertones, and the powdered sugar on top. Â The meat in our entrees was equally complex in taste, and the lamb on the lamb shank for the M-Rouzia entree came right off the bone. Save some bread for sopping up the juices. The mint tea went perfectly with everything before, during, and after the meal.

It feels cozy and the couch with pillows is really inviting. There were not too many people so it was nice and quiet and we could really enjoy the food.For appetizers, we got the Chicken Bastilla (amazing) and the Vegetarian Cigars (so crispy and good!) The Chicken Bastilla is an absolutely unusual dish, flavors which I never had before combined together. It is like a baked chicken pastry, topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. The flavors go together superbly well, the sweet and savory are very well balanced. The Vegetarian Cigars were also really good. There's a slight hint of citrus flavor in the filling which I liked. But what really stood out was the dough - it was baked completely perfect, and very flaky, hot, and delicious. I noted to my finacee that no matter how many times we might practice making something like this at home, there is no way we would ever get it to such a level. Really amazing.The entrees were a real treat as well. We had the Beef Tajine and the Lamb Tajine. The Lamb Tajine is absolutely unreal. It fell off the bone and the flavors with the ginger sauce and almonds were fantastic. I would go back here just to have this dish again. The Beef Tajine was great too - cinnamon flavor sauce with tasty onion and tomato.All in all this was an amazing dinner and I look forward to eating here again!",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"This was the second time I've come here.

The space is cozy and authentic. Recommended to all my friends.,Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"1,"I will preface my review by saying I'm sure the food is great as well as the ambiance. I do not doubt that. What I will say is that I made a trek to this place only to be greeted by someone very rudely, with seats clearly opened, telling me they didn't cook enough food for us. Their plan is taking reservations and basing how much food is cooked on this, according to the person that greeted. Now if nothing else, this doesn't sound like good business. It's certainly horrible customer service. I also called them ahead of time to ask if reservation was needed and I received no response.I'm sorry but I've been to some great great restaurants in this city and never heard this. I guess they're secretly the greatest restaurant in history to have such pride.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"This place is so delicious and filling for your buck! The service might be a little slow but it is so well worth the wait. You CANNOT make this vegetarian cous cous at home, no matter how easy you think it is to make;) And for folks that it matters to, they are working on getting a beer and wine license. Â Come give it a try!",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"2,"My family is a huge fan of Moroccan food--the beautiful bastillas, the couscous, the wonderful tajines. We once went to a small Moroccan restaurant in a strip mall in Southern California where the owner sprinkled rose water on us at the end of a wonderful meal. We have dined on Moroccan cuisine in Paris and London and have never been disappointed. Plus, I have never met a person from Morocco who was not the epitome of hospitality. I'm on a perpetual quest for great Moroccan food. I was so hoping to like this place. Small, local and run by a family rather than a restaurant chain. And it was not very expensive and I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, we won't go back. I heard they moved from Malden to Somerville so hopefully they will find some fans and improve. First off, food wise, the only item that was tasty was the chicken bastilla. The chicken M'hammer was nothing special. The chicken itself was dry and largely tasteless. The lamb rouzia was okay but there was not much meat for the dish. We ordered the roasted eggplant salad which came with some bread but the waitress did not suggest we order any couscous. We did order couscous but it was a tiny side dish which 3 people share. Â  The food overall was unremarkable. Second, the restaurant is so dark! No candles on the table to help you see just a bit. There are wall sconces covered with red or orange glass so it makes it super dark. The music and the sound system was pretty dreadful. I think they were streaming from a tablet or cellphone and it was traditional Moroccan music rather than the more contemporary music that is kind of poppy. Why? Seemed so dated and unnecessary.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,"Great, attentive service, authentic and intimate ambiance, and portions were plentiful and tasty - would recommend for a change-of-pace date night or small-group dinner, especially on a weeknight!",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"5,This place is gold.

I'm coming back every time I get a chance.LOVE LOVE LOVE!,Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"3,It was my first time eating Moroccan food so maybe we didn't know the right combinations to order... The only thing I would recommend is the lamb dish and everyone at the table agreed. The chicken bastilla was sprinkled with powdered sugar and the couscous had sweetness from the raisins. The food just wasn't to our liking because everything was TOO sweet. The service was good and the atmosphere was excellent though!,Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"4,"So, I developed a thing for Chicken B'stilla ever since I first enjoyed the appetizer at Tangierino in Charlestown. Â A wish to recreate my memories of that tender, flakey, savory yet cinnamony dish led me to Baraka CafÃ© in Central Square. Â But hopes were dashed as theirs did not compare.I first became aware of Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant when I did an online search of chicken bastilla in the area, back when they were located in Malden. Â So once they moved to Somerville in 2014, I became ever more hopeful of the opportunity to one day visit them and to sample their chicken bastilla.Well, one day finally came. Â I grabbed a cohort in consumption and headed on over early one Friday eve. Â Their menu was unlike the one found online, but at least the longed for chicken app was still there.The Almond Shake (with orange blossom water, raisins and dates) $5.99 resembled a milk shake with its frothy top. Â It arrived in a rather small goblet, but the flavor made the portion plenty. Â I'm glad I tried it, but it wasn't to my taste. Â Maybe I'm just not an orange blossom water kind of girl.A nice sliced yellow bread arrived with an olive spread along with the Chicken Bastilla $7.99 (chicken and almonds wrapped in phyllo dough baked to perfection), a domed phyllo wrapped concoction decorated with a dusting of powdered sugar and cinnamon. Â The phyllo was crisp, thin, and delicate, the filling dense and tasty. Â My DC loved it, as did I, though I suspect still that Tangierino's version might still be number one in my heart of hearts. Â It was plenty to share as an appetizer for 2-3, though I could have been happy consuming it all on my lonesome.For our entrees, we elected to share a hot dish and a sandwich. Â The Brania sandwich $7.99 (slow cooked braised beef served in Moroccan flat bread and fried eggplants) arrived as a half loaf of the same bread, sliced open into a pocket like a pita, and filled with tender beef and soft eggplant. Â The Lamb Couscous with Vegetables $16.99 was a generous portion. Â A meaty leg and large chunk chopped vegetables topped the plate of couscous. Â The lamb was tender but rather gamey, the vegetables retained a nice bite, but it wasn't the most flavorful dish.Dinner was good, but we were in agreement that the sole dish worth a repeat was the chicken bastilla. Â Sadly, they do not offer dessert.Service was personal and friendly. Â The dining room warm and inviting, and cushion-filled.The walk from the Porter Square T stop was convenient on a nice day, as was street parking just outside the restaurant.3.5 stars.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"4,"Went here on a snowy Friday night and ordered a number of dishes whose exact names now elude me. Everything was delicious (especially the hummus served with the bread, and the beef makfoul) except the roasted chicken, which although not bad was surprisingly bland in comparison to the other dishes. The atmosphere is great-- very cozy. If they only offered wine though! Still, it's a nice little place tucked into a corner of Somerville that is otherwise something of a restaurant desert. Check it out.",Moroccan Hospitality Restaurant,"585 Somerville Ave Somerville, MA 02143"3,"I have been in Moroccan Hospitality twice in the span of the last 2 years. I am Moroccan, born and raised in Morocco and have family who are in the business of cooking and hospitality back home. For a place called Moroccan Hospitality, it was not hospitable at all. The woman running the place is really rude. The first time I went ( during the fasting month of Ramadan), she offered me the Ramadan fasting menu to start with (13 dollars). I came with a friend who wasn't fasting so we decided to just order ordinary dinner dishes... She refused to serve us the regular menu (while all the other people in restaurant were having regular dishes from the menu). She said she has to first serve the Ramadan menu and that the dinner menu will not be available till an hour later, so we better order both..I told her then I would wait an hour and ordered an appetizer that she said will only arrive in 45 min... After 15 min we had our appetizer and 10 min after that our dinner dishes... This goes to say this was just bluff to get us to order both menus ... As to the food, I find it to be irregularly good, my friend's chicken tagine was good, my couscous's chicken was bad (I was given chicken wings with no meat on, instead of a typical chicken leg or breast).

Carl Dooley, Top Chef finalist, has been here most of the times I've visited. It's prix fixe and the menu has been very different every time. Good: the dishes are mostly hits, the consistency is there, the price is beyond reasonable. If you want a high end, multi course meal that is impeccably prepared, Dooley has you covered.Average: the service is mostly attentive but not that notable. The wine list is limited and leans obscure. Most of the bottles are pretty well tuned to the cuisine, though. The decor isn't anything special.Bad: one thing I've disliked is the consistent use, or borderline overuse, of cumin in the dishes. I like cumin but it's omnipresent, at least in every visit I've had, and sometimes feels out of place. Â For the price you can't beat this place.

We had Christian as our server and he was excellent; explained the dishes well and so personable. The seasonal, ever changing menu was curated to perfection--each dish balanced purposefully, like its own work of art. There were two options for each of the four courses so I recommend coming with someone and ordering one of each, it was fun to try 8 unique items.

Â But with food and wine this good who cares!We chose to order each item between us so we could try all and also do the wine pairing, and so glad we did.

Â Everything about the evening, from the food and the service to the pacing and the ambiance, was sheer perfection. Â The intimate and beautifully decorated space was warm and welcoming, exuding a cozy and homey atmosphere that could not have been further from the cold and pretentious vibe one tends to associate with fine dining experiences.I knew going in that the four-course, prix fixe menu offered two options for each course, but was pleasantly surprised to find that many little extras were included between the courses as well, such as a tray of oysters to kick things off, homemade granola bars to bring home at the end, palate cleansing sorbet before dessert, plus a couple more surprises along the way. Â The attention to detail throughout really impressed me, and we ended up being served more like five or six courses' worth of food before the evening was done.As for the food itself... words almost fail me. Â Between the three of us I was able to sample all eight of the courses in addition to the extras mentioned above, and there was not a single thing that was not spectacular. Â I was especially blown away by the sesame meringue with tahini cream and grape sorbet, and the cured swordfish with pistachios and sultanas. Â And the rabbit leg khao soi. Â Please don't make me choose favorites among these dishes; they are all my children and I love them equally!If dining here I would highly recommend adding the wine pairing option, which for our meal included five expertly selected glasses and truly enhanced the experience every step of the way.We came here to celebrate a special occasion, but I may need to add another line in my monthly budget just so I can return to the Table more often. Â They have a standing wine bar where you can sample some of the food without shelling out for the full dinner service, but honestly I think that would be too much of a tease for me.

The staff and chef were friendly, engage you conversation, inform you about the details of each dish and very attentive. The food was amazing, the pairing of ingredients was great.

I really enjoyed the fish and Chef Dooley shared that it actually came from Maine. I liked how the fish was paired with Asian pair which brought a subtle sweetness.Second dish: glazed turnip ravioli & Maine mussels. This was my favorite dish of the night! The chewiness of the mussels with the light crunch of the brussel sprouts and breadcrumbs with the cheesy cream of the ravioli was a perfect combination.Third dish: roasted beef strip loin & short rib ragout. There was a very interesting aroma to this dish (in a good way), it wasn't the beef strip or the short rib. Both were flavorful and good though. Dessert before dessert! We got complimentary apple sorbet :) delicious. Fourth dish: chocolate cremeux.

Where to even begin for this place. This is the first time where I wish there were more stars on Yelp to give because this restaurant deserves ALL of them. I was a little hesitant about even going to this restaurant at first because of the price (and honestly didn't think any meal would be worth almost $100/person) but after one of the best two hour experiences I've ever had, I'm convinced that it was indeed worth (plus the price includes tax and tip!).Parking: Plenty of street parking all around. You can now pay the meters on an app if you give them your zone and licence plate so no need to bring quarters!Ambiance: This is a really small restaurant so a reservation is a must. We were lucky and able to snag a table on OpenTable like two days before but I think if you want prime dinner time (~7:30), definitely book far in advance. As soon as we walked in, we could tell this place paid attention to detail. The tables were fairly spread out so you didn't feel like you were touching elbows with the couple next to you. The chairs and booth were also very comfortable. The bathroom had soap and lotion (both smelled amazing) and instead of paper towels, had real towels for hand drying. Attire was dressy casual... so like dark jeans/nicer pants but no need to get super dolled up. My boyfriend really liked the old school soul/brass music that was on in the background and apparently the album they were playing came out 9 days ago lol. Guess whoever's in charge of tunes is on top of the game. FOOD: Simply said, it blew us away. Every dish was rich and complex in flavor. Different ingredients hit my palate at different times and I felt like Gordon Ramsay in all his cooking shows. The menu rotates every month so it's super impressive that Chef Dooley and his team can create such detailed masterpieces so often. For March 2018, our favorite course was the first one - the steak was tender, and the fish was fresh. Our least favorite course was the third - I thought the sauce for the rabbit sausage was a little sour, and my boyfriend thought that the monkfish was a little too salty. However, the worst course here was honestly better/at par with a lot of other restaurants we've been to so we can't complain. In between courses we also got a slew of complimentary treats. Oysters to start, fresh sourdough bread in between our first and second course, an amazing blood orange sorbet as a palate cleanser before dessert, and wrapped granola bars to take home. With prix fixe menus, we are always a bit wary at the portion size, but both my boyfriend and I left utterly stuffed. Service: Wonderful. The wait staff were so nice and would explain each dish that was put down. We had a bottle of water on the table, yet never once had to fill our glasses ourselves. My boyfriend left for the bathroom briefly, and a waiter came to fold his napkin so it would be ready for him when he came back. Our waiter also brought us fresh silverware in between every course. The head chef himself brought some of our dishes to us and he seemed so amicable and real. Misc: Every dish (like actual plate/bowl) was super hot when brought out. I don't know why but be careful not to accidentally burn yourself lol. The tables also seemed to be wood (fake? real? idk) but ours had a large bump where we couldn't put anything on. Not a huge deal at all but just something we noticed. Overall, I'd come back here in a heartbeat. I'm already on the lookout for the next iteration of their menu.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"5,"We had an incredible dining experience here and still talk about it over a year later. Worth every penny. Dont skip out on the wine pairing- we had some of the best wine of our lives! The waitstaff and chefs were so pleasant and knowledgeable, too. If you are any chance a fan of Barley Swine in Austin, this is the closest thing you'll find to it here in Boston, and it gives it a run for its money.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"5,This place is great! Loved the food here !!! We were celebrating a special day and this was a great way to celebrate. The food is so delicious. None of the dishes served were overpowering. I was left wanting more of every single course. The decor in the place is quite cool. Haven't seen a $$$$ place set up in this way. The restaurant itself is quite small with about 10 tables maybe. You need to book well in advance to be able to get a reservation. Tables go very quickly. If I remember correctly we reserved ours about 2 months in advance. The most attractive thing about this place I feel is that the menu changes every time. The chef cooks up great combinations and such a good variety.Would love to spend another special day here.,The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"4,"My friend and I are huge Top Chef fans. Â When we heard about Carl Dooley having a restaurant we had to give it a try.Overall we thought it was really good, but just a couple things kept it from 5 stars. Â  The place is small, cozy, open kitchen, friendly. Â We were greeted with a smile and promptly seated. Â Servers etc all very friendly, perhaps a few seemed new to proper etiquette but overall a decent job.We were given a cold carrot soup that to be honest neither of us cared for at all. Â It was a really bad way to start our meal, as it didn't taste like carrot or have much flavor at all. Â We were worried this was an indication our meal would be the same, thankfully we were wrong.Since it was the prixe fixe menu it worked out well as one of us did not eat meat but seafood was ok and the menu was accommodating. Â The first course was squid or lamb. Â The squid was really, really good, so much flavor in each bite. Â It was a smidge overdressed but still delicious. Â The lamb carpaccio was also really good but was overpowered a bit too much with the olive flavor.We thought it was very odd and to be honest in poor taste to give us somewhat burnt bread. Â The menu listed house-made sourdough bread and who doesn't like homemade bread? Â But when you are toasting bread and sending it out to your patrons why would you send out burnt bread? Â We were trying to think of why you would allow that to leave the kitchen as half the bread was just unedible?The next courses, gnocchi, congee, hake and quail all were really, really good. Â I mean everything had so much flavor. Â We each would have ordered that as an entree just to have more. Â The gnocchi just melted in your mouth, the congee, a lil too much sambal for my spice level but the shrimp sausage, yummy. Â The hake with the morel mushrooms were a perfect match and the hint of sweetest from the peas made it a perfect bite. Â The quail was a lil under and the tikka masala flavor was a little lacking but still all good dishes.Dessert was just as delicious. Â The mint ice cream might have been a tad too strong and a little too much vanilla bean in the custard but we would have eaten 2 more helpings. Â I would definitely recommend this place for someone looking for bold and interesting flavor combinations, you wont be disappointed. Â As always never take my word and check it out yourself. Â And just to note, this place is pretty small and dinner takes a minimum of 2 hrs so plan accordingly.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"5,"Went for the Valentine's Day 6-course tasting menu. Incredible! This spot had been on our list for quite some time and I am so glad we had a chance to go. We went into this dinner blind, I had no idea what the menu would be. I had shared with the host on the phone that I had an allergy to raw shellfish. The staffs attention to detail with this information impressed me. As soon as we sat down the server came over to my seat and provided me with a separate menu that had no raw selfish. They must have noted that it was me with the allergy because they didn't even question it when we sat down. Â Every course was delicious! But a few that stood out to me were a jasmine rice with scallop dish, and an oxtail ravioli dish. The little extra treats that came out were a nice touch. We left completely stuffed!Highly recommend this spot! But there are only 20 seats in the restaurant so reservations are a must.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"5,"Love everything about this place The food was very good. Interesting ingredient and unique combinations. The ambience is fantastic as I like the open kitchen concept.

We opted for the wine tastings with the meal and they paired it perfectly - it was a good deal for $40 extra. The courses were perfectly timed and my favorite dishes were desserts. I can't wait to come back again!,The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"4,"For $98 per person, including tax and tip, you get a four course meal plus a lot of extras. Â My friend ordered one set of the plates, and mine the other, so I tasted everything.The night started with an amuse bouche some peppers they had roasted and served with anchovies. Â I avoided the fish, and the peppers were delicious. Â Then they brought our corn bread with butter and a jelly. Â AMAZING. Â The mussels and chorizo was good, but on the hot side. Â It came with a side of bread with aioli on it - YUM! The pork lettuce wraps were awesome. Â I loved the flavor and texture of the pork, cucumber, lettuce, and chicharron.The spaghetti and shrimp dish was amazing. Â I loved it and used my spoon to get the last of the sauce. Â The lamb ragout was OK, not great.By the time the main courses came out, I was full. Â Their portions are too big. Â Mains included flank steak with kimchi and avocado, which was spicy, and a swordfish curry which was also spicy.Desserts were a strawberry jelly roll cake, delicious, and a chocolate almond cake like dessert served with a too heavy cherry compote. Â The ice cream on both desserts was the best part.Then they brought some lemon cookies with the bill, and then they brought some homemade granola bars to take home. The wines are amazing, and they should be given how much they cost. Â My one glass of bubbles was $18. Â That's a lot for ONE glass! Â The shrubs were not good - too watery and bitter.Overall, the food was good but not amazing. Â And there's way too much of it. Â And we were there for a really long time. Â Our reservation was for 8:30, but our table wasn't ready, and so it was 9:10 PM before any food hit the table. Â That was tough because it was late and we were tired and hungry.I'd go again, but I'm not sure what I'd do about the huge portions - take half of each dish home?",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"3,"Things that could be improved:- Would not bring my vegetarian friends or housemate without notice: default options don't seem to indicate vegetarian on the menu before dessert. (I'm _sure_ they will accommodate, but it would be nice to have options on the menu!)- There was cilantro on so much! I personally loved this, but might need a warning for anyone who doesn't like.- The waiter suggested since there were 2 of us to just get everything and share. This was a great idea in theory, but 'redder'/darker spicy options were so hot-spicy that the lighter, usually whiter, fishier option often seemed extremely bland in comparison. My dinner mate also got sick partway through, wondered if something in the spicier dishes didn't agree with him. I felt a stomach roll after the spicy flank steak without knowing why, before watching my dinner mate completely fade and disappear to the bathroom. (Think it may've started for him with the extremely seasoned larb.)Best parts of our night:- Zero knocks to the attending staff: they were incredibly accommodating, attentive, friendly, and helpful even though half our table got sick halfway through the meal, and the other half trying to be friendly about steering clear of major gluten ingredients (without being over the top about it). Volunteered accommodations included corn pasta, a popover, oatmeal crumble for dessert, and packing up the rest of our meal to take home (sans ice cream).- All of the redder options of the meal (flank steak, larb) were hot and delicious, even with the heat+spice. The swordfish(?) entree was also unusually amazing, perfectly textured.- The strawberry rhubarb crumble, fresh granola, fudge, and cherry (sans amaretto) desserts were all quite tasty.Overall, deeply appreciated the staff's friendly professionalism, but not a great-value night for the cost.",The Table at Season to Taste,"2447 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge, MA 02140"4,"Really 4.5 stars. Have been here a number of times. Â You don't have to have the tasting menu. You can sit at their little wine bar and order a la carte. Â The food has been consistently good. Â I can't say that every dish is a home run. Â But at least every time we go, there is one extremely memorable dish that they knocked out of the park.Plus, the hospitality is fantastic.

You can see the whole place from any spot, and can also see the chefs at work. The staff are highly attentive without being awkward or overbearing. When I got up from my seat, I came back to find my napkin neatly folded back in its place. The food... oh, the food. We didn't have a single thing that was mediocre, let alone a disappointment. Each dish had textures and tastes that were just phenomenal! Two of my faves were the lamb vindaloo and the hake fish with beans.

The table definitely lives up to expectations. (Plus tasting menu is $69) The staff is super welcoming and have a great aura. The place is very cozy. We ordered one of everything just to try. Everything was balanced and delicious. We were definitely stuffed at the end... ( 4 course with two extra complimentary dessert bites).Instead of commenting about every dish. Our favorite of each course:-Focaccia bread was the best ever. It was extra crunchy on the outside and such soft on the inside. I can hear my bf bit into his bread. It came with a side of burrata with olive, also yum! -Jonah crab & corn lettuce wrap: We liked it because it had a very very strong crab flavor. Basically like a cold crab salad. -Ricotta & corn ravioli was really interesting. The Pancetta was super fatty and moist yet dry on the meat side (as you would expect). -Scallops & pole beans: The scallops were cooked so perfectly. It had a nice butter seat on the outside and super tender inside. You can smell them as you're waiting for your dish. (My bf loved it although he doesn't prefer scallops!)-Complimentary peach sorbet was on point. -Smoked Vanilla Ice Cream Bar surprised me by how strong the smokey flavor was.

After a sag a few years ago, the Foundry is back in a very welcome way.My wife and I had another marvelous after-movie dinner tonight. We started with a dozen fresh oysters on the half-shell, and they were as good as oysters get. My wife then had the mussels as a main, while I had the pan-seared cod. Both our mains were amazing. Our wine was a very nice and moderately priced Alto Adige MÃ_ller Thurgau.This was a second five-star dinner in as many months at the Foundry. My previous entree was the pork loin, and it too was amazingly scrumptious.We are particularly impressed by the sides, that were as lovingly prepared and presented as the centerpiece of each entree.The service was prompt, attentive, and well-done -- especially for a Saturday night.All in all, a five-star dinner at what is, for us, the best restaurant in Davis Square.",Foundry on Elm,"255 Elm St Somerville, MA 02144"4,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews!

However, the hostess made my friend feel unwanted immediately due to inappropriate assumptions made about keeping hair out of the buffet, instead of just asking questions. You see, my friend has a visual impairment and has a trained guide dog. According to ADA, service animals are allowed to enter public establishments with their handler, including those with self-service food lines. The hostess told us it was a buffet brunch and said that my friend would have to keep the hair out of the food. She did not welcome us into the restaurant as she starred at the dog. She did not tell us there were other menu items besides the buffet. She did not ask my friend any questions about needs or procedures of a service animal such as: Where does the dog sit during your meal? or If you choose the buffet, will you need assistance getting your plate? Or even simply, I'm not familiar with service animals, will you need any assistance from us while you dine? Although highly unlikely, perhaps the hostess asks every person to keep their hair out of the buffet?I hope you will consider providing education for your employees so that future customers with and without disabilities are treated with respect and made to feel equally welcomed.

It's also easier to get a spot on their extensive bar area for drinks compared to other places when you forget to make a reservation. I've tried a few things here and everything has been generally good. I keep coming back for the burger though. At $15 it's not inexpensive, but it is so good it is definitely worth it.

I pass by frequently, but felt that it was too rich for my blood, and cheaper options nearby were good enough for me. A friend encouraged me to go, and so I decided to live a little. I was not disappointed.Yes, the service was friendly, and helpful. It was all I would expect of a nicer casual dining restaurant, but the food is what blew my mind.The first thing I noticed is that the food is just a normal price for a casual dining restaurant. It is not unusually expensive at all, so that was an initial relief. After cruising the menu she ordered a burger, while I was like, ""YOLO! What's a spaetzel?"" What came back was absolutely delicious.The kitchen reasonably accomodated my nut allergy, and cut that out of the spaetzel. What was left was an absolutely wonderful plate of kale, squash, and green onions. I am not the kind of person to say that vegetables are tasty relative to other vegetables. This plate tasted great in general. It was bar none, hands down tasty. Then my friend could not finish her burger, and I got a piece of that, and was impressed with how soft, and juicy the beef was. Wendys was a good burger to me before, but I have since learned my lesson on how burgers are supposed to be done. Upgrade the french fries to a poutine, and that is a wrap, folks.Do your self a favor, and get to Foundry for dinner one of these days. You will be pleasantly surprised.

Two of us got the beer dinner and the other three ordered off the regular menu. We've been to Foundry in the past for the beer dinner and typically it's two smaller plates accompanied with two beers. Tonight's menu showed two plates with three beers. We thought it was odd, but our server didn't mention anything so we just assumed the menu was correct. After the second course/second beer our waiter came back and asked if anyone else wanted anything to drink. The others ordered another beer and the two of us who ordered the beer dinner were waiting for the last beer, a session IPA. When we asked the waiter about it he looked at us as if we were crazy and said the last two beers listed were a choice, not both. Had we known we would have asked for the session IPA, not the fruity strawberry-blueberry wheat beer or whatever it was. My friend and I were never asked which beer we wanted, and the beer dinner menu didn't explicitly say one OR the other. I've had this particular waiter in the past and he's never been great, but tonight he was unnecessarily rude to the point that I have no interest in coming back to Foundry when there are a handful of other great restaurants around Davis that have great food and friendly waiters.

We came around 7pm on a Wed night and there was already a 1.5 hour wait. (The restaurant is pretty tiny) However, you can put your name down and they'll call you when your table's ready, so you don't actually have to wait there. That being said, definitely plan to go early to put your name down, as after a certain point in the night they'll stop taking names altogether. We started off with some of the oysters, which were delicious and tasted very fresh. Then I got a lobster roll while my sister got the cioppino. Would have liked to try the pasta I'm a huge fan of lobster rolls, and while I appreciate the generous portion of lobster (which makes up for the $30+ price tag) the roll itself could have been better. There was so much lobster piled on it was difficult to eat and made the bread really soggy. The cioppino was also solid, but not extraordinary.Overall I had a good experience and the service was great. But I would probably only come back if I didn't have to wait.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Holy moly guacamole! How is this not on any of my Boston's must see/try list!? I only discovered this place because my friends lived in the area and told me I HAD to come here instead of the other well known place (not important enough for me to remember the name apparently). Well, their recommendation did not disappoint.Very cute and quaint place, although I've heard they're always full/packed. My friends and I arrived a little after 2 so the usual lunch storm should have settled, but we still ended up having to wait. No issue, we just put our name down and hopped right into a few of the other shops near by, even popping in for a quick aperol spritzer. The wait was totally worth it! The amount of lobster in our roll was ridiculous. I had to eat some of it with my fork because it was stuffed so full. The traditional version, I've heard is good. But definitely go with the warm buttered version, even though I'm biased and eat the majority of my seafood with butter...you won't regret it!I opted for more carbs and went with fries as my accompaniment, but my friends got the salad, which had a delicious creamy balasamic vinagrette!Definitely come to Neptune Oyster, even though there'll definitely be a wait, it's so worth it!",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"This place is amazing, which obviously comes through from the sheer number of reviews and high ratings. Oysters, cioppino, lobster roll... Everything is top notch! I was hesitant to pay for such an expensive lobster roll here since there are so many in Boston, but trust me it's worth it. They give a VERY generous portion of lobster and the hot, buttery roll can't be beat.Pro tip- the wait is always long, so be prepared to put your name down and go explore the city for an hour. I usually eat a light snack and then put my name down so that I'm not hangry by the time I get a seat... They will call you 10-15 min beforehand.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"If this were colonial Boston, pilgrims would very likely accuse Neptune Oyster of witchcraft for bewitching the masses with their wickedly good food. Maybe they would claim link to pagan superpowers with Neptune himself? Okay that's taking the metaphor too far, but in any case, Neptune Oyster lives up to the hype. We each started off with a clam chowder, and it's not what I expected--it was better. I'm used to creamy, chunky clam chowder that's heavy on potatoes, and Neptune's version was lighter and with a consistency halfway to that of a soup. It's a surprise after mentally preparing yourself for something indulgent, but you can actually appreciate the subtle flavors of the clams instead of a Campbell's cream of potato. They were also very generous on the portion of fresh whole clams. Similarly, the hot butter lobster roll was no less than epic, even though it was again different from the mayo-based lobster salad rolls I had pictured. Neptune's embraces lobsta rolls in its purest form: an overwhelming serving of pure lobster, minimally dressed with a thin layer of butter, sandwiched in a fluffy brioche bun with just enough carbiness to complement the lobster which stole the show. The fries completed the feast.Tip: The food was delicious and the portions were big. I split with a friend where we each got a clam chowder and shared the lobster roll, and it was the perfect amount of food (with just enough space for a cannoli afterwards). The other seafood looked amazing as well, and I don't think you could go wrong with anything.Tip #2: The space is fall and this place is infamously popular, so I suggest getting here early (i.e. by 5pm on weekdays, and even then expect a wait). They do have a nice system where you can leave your cell phone number and they will alert you when the table is almost ready, so you can wander around the quaint neighborhood and soak in the rustic Italian ambiance while waiting.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"4,Came here on Tuesday night at 5pm. Luckily we didnt have to wait for our table. Def try kusshi oyster! Its less salty and has a cucumber-ish refreshing taste! They ran out of fresh sea urchin so we ordered their Tuesday special which is a sea urchin bucatini: fresh sea urchin meat with bacon cubes and peas cooked in super buttery and rich sauce over bucatini. It def taste good. But i have to say its a little bit too greasy and heavyThe server was super friendly and she said they are famous for their butter lobster roll. Will have to try that next time.,Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"We stop by Neptune Oyster every time we are in town. The wait at 12:30 was about 1 to 1.5 hours on a Friday. We waited to be seated and started off by having the Spanish Octopus, Dayboat Scallops Crudo, Uni Toasts and the Chatham Blue Mussels for appetizers. Followed by the Kumamoto and Beausoleil oysters. The highlights were the charred, tender octopus, the zesty, succulent scallops and the oysters are always good. The Kumamoto was a safe choice and the Beausoleil was recommended by another customer. We would definitely get all of the listed again. The mussels were good and slightly spicy, but nothing extraordinary. The uni toasts didn't really have much of an uni taste as it was overwhelmed by the buttery taste. It tasted like a nice buttery, toasted bread which was yummy but not what we were expecting. Ordered the cioppino and lobster and sea greens salad. The cioppino is always good - it had was delicate but full of seafood flavors in the broth yet feeling so light. It wasn't heavy in tomatoes like other versions. The lobster salad was basically lobster with seaweed, micro greens, nuts and a citrusy dressing. Nice and light if you're looking for something light, but it is mainly lobster and seaweed. So, don't try if you don't like seaweed. Overall, we had a great meal and our friend had the lobster roll, which was nice and yum. The buttery bun was very light and fluffy with a generous mound of lobster. We definitely will come back. By the time that we left, the wait was over 2 hours according to others. The overall service was fair. The highlights were the food and they're constantly busy so it's fine. We enjoyed it and would recommend it to others!",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"3,I know that NO has crazy good reviews and thus why this tiny spot can have four hour waits for tables but I found it to be just OK. Â A case of over- hype?We got our name on the list early - about 4pm so the 2.5 hour wait did not seem too bad especially when they called at 6pm and said there was a table.The place is certainly electric given the tightness of the space. Â We started with a sardine appetizer which was decent but not great. Â For my main I Â ordered the hot buttered lobster roll - it was good but later in the week I had a better one for less money at Boston Chowda in Quincy Market Â (I was pretty shocked myself). Â The NE chowder was pretty good.Given the prices and the reputation I would have expected better.,Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"While waiting to eat here can be a total pain, the food is worth it!There will probably be a long line out the door to just sign in or put your name in. Once your name is on the list, your wait will likely be 1.5+ hours. The wait time when my husband and I visited was a whopping 2.5 hours. I recommend coming here NOT hungry and plan to let the wait build your appetite. Or maybe get a snack at one of the many options in the area. When you are finally seated, expect to get comfortable with your neighbors, as you will probably rub against them as you try to eat. This is especially true if you're seated at the bar. Doesn't that sound like a total pain?Well, good news is, the service here is efficient! We were seated, ordered, got our food, ate, and were on our way in probably an hour or maybe even less!! Some may feel rushed, but you might find you want in and out after having waited 2.5 hours. The oysters are delicious and there are many varieties to choose from. My husband and I also ordered the clam chowder and hot lobster roll. The chowder was phenomenal: creamy, flavorful, abundant in clams, and slightly spicy from black pepper. As with the lobster roll, it was heaping with huge chunks of sweet lobster and the bun was perfectly toasted. It was served with a generous serving of fries that were also delicious. Definitely worth trying if you're willing to wait!",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"My husband and I waited 1 hour to eat at this restaurant. It was well worth the wait! I certainly walked around the block to build up an appetite. I have to say this cozy restaurant had the most unbelievable lobster roll. It was $31 made with a very meaty melted buttery portion in the most delicious roll they get from Iggy's which is known for their bread. I had a choice of having it with fries or an arugula baby salad. It was a smart move having salad. Prior to that, I had the most delicious selection of oysters from all parts of New England mostly Massachusetts and Maine. they have a really good selection of white wine and all I can say about their Seafood is FRESH! I'm not certain if I would wait that long again but eating here was definitely something that I wanted to do for the past few years!Because this place was popular, sometimes you're seated with people at the regular tables. It was so funny, we've chatted with this young couple who was on a first date... Certainly made dining experience more entertaining. They obviously previewed what we are eating so they ended up ordering the lobster roll, but with fries. I believe they were fresh cut fries but I can't confirm that. Leaving the restaurant, and seeing people wait patiently for their table, they whispered, ""What's good here?"" I responded, "" I waited 1 hour for a lobster roll.""",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"4,"Guess I can add my two cents to the most highly reviewed place in Boston by Yelpers! Warm Lobster Roll with butter and a side of dressed greens-- pretty amazing! Also amazing, we stood in line before the restaurant opened on a Saturday and got in for the first seating!! FYI we were about #15 and 16 in line.. we walked past this place in the morning and there were already 2 guys standing by the doors at 10:45 (they open at 11:30). I was trying to count how many seats there were in the actual place, it's about 34 including the bar seating. My husband and I had seats right by the guy shucking and prepping the oyster platters which was fun to see. The Lobster Roll itself was so fresh and stuffed full with a generous amount of lobster meat. For $31 this was like a one time experience. I absolutely loved the roll but not sure I could fully appreciate the nuances that made this the best ever. Given, neither of us eat raw oysters which is the main specialty this place is known for. Service was quick and efficient.

At the end of the meal, we checked the bill so we'd learn her name and since it read ""Pickerel"" we assumed some kind of mistake. Nope. Turns out all the waitstaff have ""fish names"" which is the greatest thing I've ever heard.

Â My husband and I wanted to go where the locals go. Â The concierge's recommendation... Neptune Oyster Bar.

Â For four years and 295 days I dreamed about this lobster roll, and finally, I got to return to Boston.I'll give you one guess where we ate our first meal. Â Now, Neptune Oyster Bar isn't a big place, so be prepared to wait. Â Even at our early dinner at 4:30 p.m., we had to wait a few minutes.

Â Maybe the memory was better than the reality? Â Not so at Neptune Oyster Bar. Â Their lobster roll was just as delicious as I had remembered. Â That buttery roll was STUFFED with lobster.

Â And if you're not in Boston, it might be worth your while to get there soon!",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"4,"*** Disclaimer: I got cold lobster roll with mayo, not hot with butter ***There is no doubt that Neptune Oyster is one of the most popular seafood restaurants in Boston. This seafood restaurant started in 2004 and the restaurant was ranked #79 in ""Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the US for 2016"".I mean holy cow ... the door wasn't even open at 11 AM on Monday and the line had already formed! In fact, the line even went around the block by 11:30 AM! I was the 20th person in the line at 11 AM and was also among the first wave of customers (generally speaking the first wave of customers are the first 30 people in line).Let's get straight to the point - Neptune Oyster's signature item is HOT Maine lobster roll with butter (with an option of fries or salad for side dish). Unfortunately, I should not overhear and listen to the lady who sat right next to me at the bar seats because she influenced my decision and ultimately made me order traditional cold lobster roll with mayo instead. Five minutes later I tried to fix my mistake by asking my waitress whether I could switch my order from cold to hot lobster roll. And the next thing I knew, cold lobster roll came out and she simply said ""oh your order is here already"". The staff was definitely busy handling waves of customers, but I am still in shock that she couldn't even handle my simple request considering how many hot and cold lobster rolls they serve to customers.Oh if you are allergic to seafood, you will only find two non-seafood option on the menu - rib eye steak and burger with fried oysters (okay so burger is not exactly a non-seafood option). Since it is also an oyster house, you will also get a ordering sheet for various oysters from different regions (with detailed descriptions on salt level and flavor profiles). I did notice that saltier oysters were more expensive than oysters with less salt.***Maine Lobster Roll (toasted brioche roll cold with mayo, market price $31): I got the traditional lobster roll and honestly it was a great lobster roll (better than the one at Red's Best Seafood) - just meaty lobster with toasty brioche roll. Salad tasted alright and nothing to write home about.Savage Blond (Bedeque Bay, Prince Edward Island, Canada - $3.30) and Kumamoto (Shelton, Washington - $3.50): Personally I like Savage Blond better than Kumamoto. The flavor profile for Kumamoto described it as low salt, but it still tasted slightly saltier than I expected.***Very solid cold lobster roll (even though I regret not getting hot lobster roll) and overall I would give 4.5-star on their food, but I have to round down to 4-star due to non-attentive bar service, long waiting line, and hefty price.",Neptune Oyster,"63 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"5,"Everything I dreamed of and more!This was our first stop in Boston, but when we arrived there was a 2 hour wait time.

All the ingredients complimented each other so well. My boyfie's sister had octopus for the first time here and really liked it! Do not be scared to try octopus here!!! It's SOOOOO GOOOD!! x Clam Chowder - great clam chowder. Little to no heavy cream so it was lighter than what I'm used to. Generous amounts of clam :)x Hot Lobster Roll - WOW, such good lobster on this roll. I think I may like the lobster at Jame Hook better, but this was SOOO good because it was bathed it butter. I didn't get to try the bread part because I was so full, but the lobster portion was very, very good. Get the hot one, not cold!x Variety of oysters - Tried some medium oysters and small oyster. Obviously, enjoyed the small ones better, but all were super good and fresh. No fishiness at Neptune :)This place is worth the hype IMO. Fresh seafood and a great variety to choose from.

I'm normally a carnivore, but would happily order this dish again for its spicy kick and creamy base. Pairs amazingly with rice!! We also ordered a Noodle Soup dish with chicken and lots of veggies.

The pumpkin curry was amazingly flavorful, spicy, and sweet and the tofu and bok choy, while definitely on the oily side was great as well (tasted like a fairly typical Chinese stir fry dish, not bad by any means but not as interesting and flavorful as the momo and pumpkin curry).On the other hand, there was one singular server for the entire restaurant. The food didn't take a long time, but getting water refills took forever and it took us about 10 minutes to flag down the waiter to get some extra rice when we asked.

We started with vegetarian momos (basically another word for dumplings) which were yummy but didn't blow other dumplings I've had away. I had the Gyathuk Chocho with chicken for my meal and enjoyed it, but again, no more than other pan fried noodles I've had. To be fair, I lived in Dongguan for a couple months and regularly ate noodles like this from street vendors so I'm perhaps a bit biased. They have a lot of vegetarian options which might compel me to come back when I'm looking for somewhere to do dinner with my non-carnivorous friends. Big bummer for me is that they don't have a liquor license. Understandably, I should have done my research to discover that beforehand, but that's always gonna cost you a star in my book.

I think I would describe it as a mix between what an average Americans know as Chinese food and Indian food. The server was very friendly and helpful. He gave his insight on the dishes that we were ordering and also warned us about their spicy sauce (It actually wasn't that spicy to my palate). The food is what really amazed me though. We ordered Momos (they look very similar to Chinese buns/dumplings), Aloo Tikka (potato cakes topped with mint), and Shamday (Tibetan beef curry). Momos were delicious and it came with two different sauces (one mild and one spicy). Aloo Tikka was surprising, since I was expecting a hot dish, but it was served at ambient temperature (I think that's normal?). Regardless of the surprising temperature, dish was delicious and the mint sauce was to die for. Lastly, the curry was good, but I felt that the portion was a little bit on the smaller side.

Â They all achieve the trifecta of the perfect dumpling: 1. Soft but slightly chewy dough that doesn't fall apart2. 70%-30% filling to dough ratio3. Delicious filling.I've had a lot of dumplings in the area and it's usually the finer details that separate the memorable from the forgettable. Â What makes Martsa's momos superior to the other places are the flavors in the filling and the chili dipping sauce.A successful filling has strong flavors that are subdued enough not to jump out and kick your taste buds in the face but prevalent enough that you taste the warmth and flavor. Â I like my filling to fall closer to the unsubdued end of the spectrum. Â I want the meat to be subtle but enhanced by a slight crunch of veggies and the powerful backdrop of garlic and ginger. Â Martsa delivers on every count.The momos don't need a dipping sauce but the red chili sauce that comes with it takes the entire experience to the next level. Â Most importantly, it's hot. Â If the filling isn't powerful enough for you, the sauce will make sure you have tears of both pain and joy running down your cheeks. Â In addition to being hot, it's also delicious. Â The chef manages to coax out the maximum flavor from the chilies he uses and it ties the entire experience together.I've often paired this with a mug of steaming hot Indian chai, Southeast Asia's answer to the latte. Â It's a creamy, sweet tea with just a little bit of froth that complements each bite of a steamed momo dipped in fiery red chili sauce. Â It's also great afterwards to help the food down and doubles as a dessert.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"1,"While the noodle soup is out of this world, we had TERRIBLE service, which was profoundly disappointing. After 4 of 5 were served in a relatively timely manner, a 6th arrived and got his food in a jiffy. The 5th person waited an hour before getting his food. All of us were already done eating! When the bill came, they overcharged us for something we did not order, and when we asked about the meal's lateness, both the server and the owner came over to our table and yelled in our faces. It was so upsetting, especially because their food is generally good. We were shocked and will not be coming back. We had hoped to be respected, as most customers are, but that was not the case. Unbelievable.",Martsa On Elm,"233 Elm St Ste A Somerville, MA 02144"
