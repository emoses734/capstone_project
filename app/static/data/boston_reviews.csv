Followed by mains of: lobster, snapper, sea bass.Sides make the meaThe sides of creamed spinach, Brussel sprouts, roasted corn, and broccoli. All incredible!! Â Service was fantastic!!Back again for the second time. This time I had the scallops and clam chowder. Incredible. Scallops were perfectly prepared on a bed of risotto. Clam chowder was superb.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"1,5,"Atmosphere: sophisticated, high energy, but also had a laid-back, almost retro kind of elegance. Most patrons were impeccably dressed for upscale/night on the town, although I did see a few in ripped jeans and tank tops, who should have been turned away. It's not a trashy nightclub, folks.I had the beat manhattan, the best crab, and the best creme brÃ»lÃ©e ever here.Service: Impeccable. Our server was patient, delightful and genuinely cared for our entire experience. My husband, 12 year old son and I were in a smaller dining room with an incredibly loud, unruly group of people who were drunk and swearing. We couldn't even hear each other speak. The waitress noticed our discomfort (especially our son, who has issues with overwhelming noise) and the dining room manager found another place for us to enjoy our meal. A cozy booth in the main dining area. Our biggest worry was that we'd have another server perhaps not as wonderful as Sabrina, but she let us know she'd be taking care of us. The dining room manager came by to make sure everything was okay.Now the food: Fantastic. We enjoyed the truffle deviled eggs with caviar, and the ""smoking"" shrimp cocktail. My son had a beautiful 6 oz filet mignon and king crab legs. Husband had the sea bass, and I enjoyed an off-menu salmon with a crab saladOn top. For sides we chose the lobster mashed potatoes and spinach. Both were very good. I got to try a little of everything! We barely had room for dessert but couldn't resist. Baked Alaska, carrot cake, and creme brÃ»lÃ©e were outstanding. We hardly finished half, because Sabrina brought us butter cake to try as well. Divine!I can't say enough good things about Ocean Prime. We weren't there for any special occasion, just in town for a memorial service and wanted a great meal. They made us feel special and cared for, in addition to serving up amazing food and drink. You can't really ask for more than that. Bill was $347 and worth every penny.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"2,5,"Happy birthday to meeeeeeeee!!!This year was super low key as I had a lovely dinner with my mom (last year I was in Europe).Everything was amazing! The food (piping hot, fresh and cooked to perfection), service, live music and ambiance.The hostesses are all so sweet and friendly. It was very lovely interacting with them all upon entry. They definitely set the tone. Thanks ladies!Our server was Alain C. He is kind, knowledgeable of all menus (cocktail and food) and had a great personality. He also made great recommendations - you must try the blackened snapper! I'm so glad Ocean Prime has been established in Boston (I'm in San Fran and the closest one to me is in Beverly Hills)...Overall it was a wonderful birthday and I am so happy that I celebrated at Ocean Prime!",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"3,5,"Our first time in Boston and wanted a nice dining experience. Ocean Prime did not disappoint. Everything from the service to the food was amazing. We had the Calamari which was so tender and delicious. Cream of Lobster soup, and a seafood dish. We took to go the chocolate, peanut butter desert. I would definitely dine here again!",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"4,5,"I won't tell you about the food, experience that all on your own.The SERVICE here is off the wall phenomenal.Ask for Derek Shaw and hope that Julie Beal is managing the night you're there! It's worth the price of admission and you'll want to come back for more!!!",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"5,3,"I went to Ocean Prime with a group of friends. Â I am not normally a ""steakhouse"" guy, in part because I find them overly expensive. Â I don't need a 24 oz steak tonight, thank you. Given the extensive seafood options on the menu, I had high hopes.The decor is sort of Las Vegas meets steakhouse -- perfectly nice, but nothing particularly exciting. Â The service was extremely attentive -- perhaps overly so -- but our waiter was extremely well-informed, had strong wine suggestions. Â The food was fine. Â Everyone was pleased with their dish, but frankly, I was somewhat underwhelmed with mine for the price. Â The spicy tuna sushi roll was decent, but I get better sushi at my local sushi place next to a gas station, and they don't charge $18 for a single roll (and theirs have more actual tuna). Â My scallops were nicely done, but the risotto that accompanied it was a bit of a cheesy mess. Â My companions were all pleased with their meals, so take my criticisms with a grain of salt.Bottom line: Â it is a perfectly fine restaurant that charges you an arm and a leg for food that was underwhelming and is done better at other restaurants. Â I left feeling full, but for what the meal cost, I wasn't satisfied.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"6,5,"Best place in Boston! Big variety of all kinds and it's all 5 Star. Sushi apps, seafood and steak and all the sides like jalapeÃ±o potatoes, truffle Mac & Cheese and chopped corn house. The drinks are all great. The service is great. Levi was an outstanding waiter. I tried the surf & turf tonight. Amazing. My wife had the filet and lobster tail. You can't go wrong here.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"7,5,Visited this location while in town for work. Overall this area is really building up and is growing into a very cute social area. We ate outside as the weather was perfect. We were the only table outside but felt we had good service and weren't forgotten. All of our dishes were a good size (larger than expected) and arrived quickly. Would definitely go again!,Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"8,4,"Late dinner here with work friends, they were full up for reservations when I checked online. It was no better when I called so we figured we'd just wait it out when we arrived. It worked out well. There was an open table in the bar area and we just stayed there for our starters and dinner.Calimari to start was excellent. Crispy, not heavily battered and very tasty. Great dish to share. The deviled eggs were great but I'm not sure why three eggs were $13. Tasty and tangy with mustard, topped with caviar? You couldn't taste the caviar at all.For main, I chose the Chilean sea bass. A nice cut, very well plated. Delicious, cooked properly. Nice and flaky.For dessert, we got one order of the ten layer carrot cake. It was good. Excellent presentation and quite fancy. The icing was light and not too sweet.Tip: Get the jalapeno potatoes au gratin. Yum!",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"9,1,"I'm honestly disappointed in ocean prime. Based on priced I would expect the food here to blow me out of the water. The food, in general is mediocre, and didn't taste very fresh. It is a chain so I'm not sure why I expected local lobster/seafood.. we are only in Boston seaport. We ordered the double lobster tail meal was almost 50 and for the price I was honestly surprised at how little meat came in here. Personally, I had the Caesar salad and added scallops. Please let me tell you that this salad is 12 dollars. Okay. It's a salad. Reasonable. When I asked for scallops it came with 4... and the total price was 40 dollars!! FORTY! For a salad with 4 scallops. Honestly WOW and the scallops weren't fresh and tasted fishy. I was so disappointed and actually had a mouth drop. Someone explain this to me. The one thing that saved it here was the carrot cake. Worth it. It's delicious.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"10,4,"Solid choice for a fancy night out. It's a bit expensive, but that's expected in seaport. Can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was good but had too much of a mustard flavor for my liking. Â If you are getting soup, I recommend the French onion. It is amazing.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"11,4,"My boss took me here after a recommendation from a colleague and had a great night. We had the oysters and shrimp cocktail to start and honestly I found the best oysters I had eaten so far in the US. Very fresh, large, and perfect aftertaste.My 2 colleagues had the steak which they rated better than Mooo that we went to the night before. One had the dry aged from Kansas and he said his was top notch. I had the sea bass which was kinda average. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it was nice without blowing anyone away. Great wine pairing from sommelier- and a couple of strong but great old fashioned's to start. Service was quick considering it was rammed. Would recommend highly.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"12,5,"Made reservations on open table, wasn't crowded at all and got seated immediately. I ordered the lobster bisque soup and teriyaki salmon over rice.. Really good, hot and a lot of flavor. The server was really good, fast and attentive. Great spot to good a good dinner after along day.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"13,5,"A gem in the seaport! I have been to Ocean Prime numerous times since they opened in the Seaport - they are my go to place! I love their lunch special, my favorite being the salmon teriyaki. For dinner I love their steaks. Great bread basket. Service is stellar. But the desert... oh my. They make the BEST baked Alaska I have ever had! The carrot cake is also a good second choice.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"14,4,"Have been to Ocean Prime before, just not this location. Same name, same great experience. The surf and turf app is excellent, potatoes could have used some more seasoning, but scallop and short ribs were awesome. Since it was lunch, I took advantage of their lunch 6oz filet with two sides for $35. The lobster bisque was creamy and a little spicy which I enjoyed. Great meal without breaking the bank (for lunch anyway).",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"15,4,"This restaurant lays in the hot area of Boston seaport. This was my first time hearing of and visiting Ocean Prime, and it's hard to believe this is a chain restaurant, as my experience was fantastic and attention from its staff was perfect. We came here to enjoy my birthday celebration, and with a reservation ahead, we were sat immediately into a large spacious booth. Other parties around us were definitely loud but I enjoyed it as Â festive and prefer this type of atmosphere when dining out. We first ordered a couple cocktails that tasted excellent. Then we ordered the surf & turf appetizer, made of 2 fresh scallops, pulled pork, and mashed potatoes set in a dark flavorful sauce. I also had the twin lobster, both cooked fresh and just at the right texture and flavor. The asparagus that came with it was cooked just right. The fiancÃ© ordered the 16oz boneless ribeye on medium rare heat. It was at a perfect pinkish-red all around. Truffle butter was extra but the combination with the steak was just perfect. We also ordered a clam chowder which was well seasoned and the blend of bacon, potatoes, and clams were enjoyable. We also received a complimentary dessert as part of my birthday, for which I ordered the blueberry cheesecake. We did enjoy it, but could not finish it because of how full we were. Great atmosphere and food overall, and I'd love to come here again for another special occasion.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"16,3,"We rarely venture out to the Seaport because you know, Boston traffic. But the in-laws picked Ocean Prime for dinner, so there we went. The restaurant itself is quite large, lots of booth seating, very similar to the likes of Capital Grille, Flemings etc. Guess they're all frankly in the same category of upscale chain restaurants. The food is decent but not outstanding in any way. I have had the exact same dish served here in many other restaurants in the past, as the menu is quite standard with very little novelty. The raw oysters were small and did not taste nearly as good as other oysters places in town. The shrimp cocktail was huge and came out in a showy bowl of liquid nitrogen, but was a bit overcooked for me. My miso sea bass was thick and flaky but the flavors did not impress. A very similar version I had a couple weeks later down in Florida blows this one out of the water. The butter cake was too dense and not nearly as good as Mastro's.Our waiter was the most strange part of the meal. I can't exactly call him inattentive because he was there and did everything that needed to be done. However I would never call the service we received friendly, and it was even quite awkward at times. I don't know if that's just his personality or he hated us for some reason but was still trying to be civil...Anyways, at this price caliber, I would definitely go to Island Creek for seafood or Capital Grille for steak over Ocean Prime for better quality of food. If you just need some place nice to take out some clients etc in the area, this would do.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"17,5,"Let's start with the drinks ! Berries & bubbles was incredible, it's not to strong but after a while the alcohol starts to kick in. It was a great combination with the surf and turf (shrimp and steak.) The steak was cooked just how I wanted, along with the shrimp. Everything was very filling, however I didn't get to enjoy more of the Mac and cheese because I was so full but it was delicious very thick and creamy. Food and drink was just a 10 out 10 forgot the 5 stars. The pricing is a little up there but that should be expected. The waiter was extremely patient and helpful. The restaurant it self had live music, they were awesome and even though it was a busy Friday night, everything seem just right. Make sure you look formal. There's a lot of businesses around so that's where most of them have lunch/dinner with there suits and dresses. Also, do yourself a favor take an Uber or Lyft, there is parking but driving there will not be necessary.",Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"18,5,Between my sister and I we have been quite fortunate to have experienced many of the high end steak Resteraunt's in Boston. Last night for my sisters birthday I treated four or is to OCEAN PRIME. Â The lobster bisque was fantastic. The crab cake was average. We had two filet mignon one 6 oz the other 10. My partner in crime got the Kansas City Strip- OMG Â so flavorful! The 4th member got Teriiyaki Salmon- very good. Let it be known that all steak eaters believed the best steak out of all high end steak houses. I must not forget we had the most wonderful waitress originally from Â Galway. Such a professional and a great quick sense of humor. The price for such a perfect meal is NOT for the faint of heart.,Ocean Prime,"140 Seaport Blvd Boston, MA 02210"19,3,"Widely popular, and often very crowded and noisy, Ocean primes serves deliciously (expensive) appetizers and entrees of both land and sea creatures.

Â Honestly, it's one of my favorite places in Boston to do this.In the winter, it's cozy, warm, and the perfect place to forget about the snow and just kick back. During the summer, their outdoor seating area (on a brick patio in front of the BCA Cyclorama) is incredible and you get to see why the South End is such a cool neighborhood.It's not necessarily my #1 dinner spot if I'm in the South End, but I love this place. Â If you're looking for a great date place or visiting from out of town, you need to go here. Â Because it's not a stereotypical Boston spot (Irish, historic, or the North End), it won't show up in guide books, but it's a must hit if you're in town!",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"21,5,"After reaching out to numerous friends for my recent weekend trip to Boston several of them told me The Beehive was a must for brunch. If you're a fan of live music, an upbeat atmosphere, and someone who appreciates a new spin on brunch from time to time I'd definitely check this place out.My friends told me it be best to make a reservation since it gets super busy during standard brunching hours and boy were they right. When my friend and I walked in there had to have been about 12 people waiting to request a table with the hostess. I let her know that we had a reservation and we were instantly led to our table. The space itself is massive, with two floors they were probably serving well over a hundred people during the time we were there. They placed us at a table on the main level close to the stage which was really appreciated. When I had made the reservation I let them know we were celebrating a special occasion (catching up with an old friend). I'm happy they accommodated us for it!When it came time to order I wanted to stick with a something unique to the restaurant. I choose it's namesake Beehive X Burger ($19) which came with some unique toppings such as chipotle avocado slaw and bacon jam, along with a side of fries. This was definitely an extremely well made and tasty burger! I was particularly hungry that morning and this hit the spot. This burger also didn't fall apart in my hands after the first bite which is something to be appreciated.Our servers were really great too. They gave us time to look over the menu and made sure to ask us if everything was alright with our dishes half way through our meals. This place claims to be the best brunch in Boston and even though I haven't been everywhere it definitely takes the cake in my book in terms of putting a lively spin on the classic brunch experience.",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"22,3,"The ambiance at The Beehive was amazing - easily 5 stars. This might be my new go-to place for a drink and some live music. It felt very NOLA: jazzy and cool.The service was also good. Our server was so nice, I wish she had stopped by more (mainly for drink refills) but she answered all of our questions and put our order in at lightning speed (literally we ordered and got drinks and food within 15 minutes - crazy!)The only real disappointment was the food. We went for brunch and the menu was fairly limited, but there were still a lot of good-sounding options. I chose the egg shakshuka, which I've never had (let alone heard of) before and wasn't sure what to expect. It was kind of a salsa/polenta dish with poached eggs. Not bad by any means, but not something I'd order again. Unfortunately they ran out of the sausage that goes with it so we got bacon instead and that ended up being a not so great combo.Overall, I will definitely come back to The Beehive for a drink and to just hang out for a while. Their bar scene is far above anywhere I've been in Boston so far, but I may just stick to snacks next time.",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"23,4,"This place is perfect if you're looking to elevate your brunch experience with live jazz music and classy vibes. Â I LOVE the look and feel of this place with its exposed brick walls, charming dÃ©cor and beautiful chandeliers. The live jazz music really adds to the energy and positive vibes during brunch. Â We had the eggs shaksuka, short rib benedict w/fries, salmon cakes with poached eggs & salad, and the poutine with short ribs & poached eggs, along with Bee-linis and iced coffee. The most memorable part was the short rib on the benedict and poutine- super tender and savory! All the food was yummy, though nothing out of the ordinary given the steep prices. The live jazz music experience and the hearty servings do make the price tags forgivable, but this is certainly a place you go to when you want to indulge once in a while.

Its the same menu both in the bar & dining area offering Chicken, Seafood, Steak, Lamb & even Duck.I could only consume Frites & a Salad, yet the wine tastings & multiple birthday glasses of Â wine worked perfectly for me.

Our waitress was friendly and swift. But I was surprised to have such a mediocre brunch. The shakshuka was a bit runny for me and the Moroccan sausage was dry. We also got the $19 burger (really?) that tasted okay. I've had more flavorful burgers at Five Guys. We did enjoy their potato chip fries. Their drinks are creative - we each got the Viva Tokyo and it had a nice kick.

Definitely coming back soon!",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"28,5,"The Boy had family coming to town to visit so we had thought why not take them to a restaurant that offers live music entertainment. The Beehive delivered a superb meal while offering a cool, fun ambiance.To stat we got the Bread N' Butter - warm sourdough served with delightfully addictive sea salt and honey butter. Never have I seen a basket of bread disappear sooner. We also got the Devil Eggs which in addition to being topped with bacon also came with a refreshing carrot slaw. Finally we got the Fall-Off-the-Bone Baby Back Pork Ribs. These were finger-lickin' good! They were sweet and sticky and so damn tender. Highly recommend.For my main dish, I got the Cauliflower-Brussel Sprouts Curry. I saw this being ordered by so many tables around me and after those ribs, I thought I could do without a protein-heavy entree. Did I mention that The Beehive offers a bunch of vegetarian-friendly dishes? Not only are there plenty of offerings, but this curry was BOMB. So much flavor and I loved dipping garlic naan in there or using the naan to grab at the cauliflower and brussels. The Boy and his dad shared a short rib grilled cheese and a burger - each eating half.Despite being full, dessert was obviously ordered anyway. We got a bread pudding and a cheesecake. Cheesecake was very dense (possibly because it's gluten-free) but the bread pudding was on point. The whipped cream was light and fluffy and paired well. The bread pudding wasn't too dense or oversaturated with syrup.Overall, divine meal from The Beehive.

First, they couldn't seat me until my guest arrived. I get that when it's busy, but at least the upper level was empty. So they invited my to wait at the bar. Ok, but when I was ready to be seated the bartender thought it would be easier to close out my bill with him first. Easier for whom? And $5 for tea!!!On the other hand, it was really good tea, a nice big pot of hot loose black tea. Very nice. And once seated the service was excellent and the food was interesting and delicious. I had the Eggs Shakshuka with Moroccan sausage. Great flavours and a nice size serving.

On weekends they have live jazz playing during brunch. For brunch, I recommend getting the eggs benedict with short ribs, you will leave filling very full. The quiche is a good option if you want something light. My dining partner got the Bloody Mary (as a lot other ppl were doing and he liked it) and I just got coffee which was fine.

Â It's different from everything else in Boston and a staple so I don't want to take away from that. Â But we finally had dinner here and it was pretty awful. Â We got the special appetizer which the waitress raved about- which was just pieces of bread with some odds and ends. Â Totally not worth the money. Â Then the main entrees came out, 2 looked okay, I honestly didn't ask if they were good because I was focused on mine being a joke. Â For $24 I got noodles floating around in some kind of liquid by the name of noodle paella. Â It resembled something you concoct at home before a big move when you're attempting to clean out the refrigerator and throw some random ingredients together. Â I couldn't eat it with a form because the noodles wouldn't stay and all I would get is onion. Â I ate maybe 4 bites. Â The lamb neck got a similar reception. Â It was what looked like an enormous hunk of meat and nothing else on a plate. Â Then turned out to be all bone and impossible to find meat. Â The decision was made never to order lamb neck again. Â I wish the waitress would have asked how I liked my meal after she picked up my entirely untouched plate but she didn't. Â The bill was astronomically high for the quality and we got charged for a drink we didn't have. Â Overall, dinner will not be had here again but we will be back for drinks and jazz.",The Beehive,"541 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"39,4,"The Beehive is a cool, funky joint with an eclectic vibe where you don't know if you're in an edgy bohemian lounge or an upscale, artsy jazz club.They attract a variety of acts, from slow jazz to fast flamenco and no matter who is on that stage, it's almost a guaranteed good time.I have been here several times but I have to say the real winner is their jazz brunch. Â  The crowd is more casual, the food is better, and the bottomless mimosa's....yes please. Â If you are looking for a hangover cure, I must recommend the short rib poutine. Â  The fries soak up the gravy and the rich flavor of the short ribs make this a savory delight. Â  The chicken fried steak with the biscuits and gravy were also a hit with our struggling crew. Â  Word to the wise...this will not be cheap. Â  Think more like dinner prices than breakfast prices.

Food is delicious I tried fish soup, some Maine oysters and grilled octopus as appetites along with both Monkfish and the sea-bass for main dishes. All was heavenly delicious! Thanks for your service and your delicious food! Number one restaurant in Boston.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"41,4,"M brought me to Ostra to celebrate my birthday before a show at the Opera House. We had a reservation for 5:30, when they begin seating for dinner. M arrived a bit early though so he waited at the bar, for me, but also for them to start seating so don't come early if you're the first reservations of the night.The space is huge and airy with opera ceilings, a lot of white, and giant ocean-themed canvas prints. To be honest, it felt a bit sterile and cold, but hey, we're here for the food.They have an enormous wine list, with a wide range of price points. We selected a nice dry bottle of rose that we really liked. They also bring you bread for the table that I really liked, a nice onion loaf, super soft and warm.We started with the lobster gnochetti with truffle that I loved. Super creamy and rich, with nice sized chunks of lobster and a lot of truffle flavor. For entrees, M had the halibut and I had the monkfish, both were delicious. Our one reservation with the food: it is very, VERY rich, almost too much so (actually too much so for M, on the border for me). Don't get me wrong, butter is delicious, but the flavor of it overwhelmed some of the other flavors for us. Ostra is very expensive for the portion sizes but it's a delicious indulgence that I'd be happy to repeat. That said, I go out for exorbitant dinners rarely enough that it will probably be a while before I'm back at Ostra.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"42,5,"Let's see: we split Sea Bass Tartare, Jamon Plate, octopus, King crab tortellini. Then he had Sea Bream and I had Salmon. Absolutely delightful meal and not the least bit heavy. I am leaving full and satiated but not rolling out over stuffed. Courses were timed perfectly. Service was impeccable. May very well be my new favorite. If you have not yet been to Ostra, you are missing out. The food is beautiful, creative, delicious and light. This chef knows seafood. Our second trip to Ostra, we shared the salt crusted branzino. The preparation and presentation of this whole fish is wonderful. The lemon sauce pour over is the perfect touch. Even after sharing starters of sea bass tartare, a raw fish special, charred octopus and king crab risotto, the branzino AND dessert, we left completely satisfied. Full but not rolling out for a nap. The service (Calvin!) was impeccable, professional yet fun and he picked a great wine for me, picky as I am! The manager recently transferred from L'Andana, brings his attention to detail, and above average knack for hospitality to Ostra. We would visit every week if we lived closer!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"43,5,"If you love seafood, this is the place to be! Seafood on the wall, with your drinks and on your plate. The attention to food and ambiance is impressive. Michelin needs to come and give this place Boston's first star!We arrived a bit too early for our 530p resy. They were still setting up for service but happily sat us at the bar. I started with the oyster martini which was a delicious light version of an oyster shooter. Dinner was flawless from start to finish. Staff were attentive but not overbearing. The warm house bread with it's doughy center was a perfect vehicle for the sweet butter and olive oil with just a touch of sea salt. I'm in New England, so of course I had a half dozen oysters to start. Followed by the crab risotto and Rhode Island calamari. The Jonah crab spuma was delicious topped with chunks of king crab. This risotto was not too rich at all. The calamari was the best I've tasted--crispy tentacles and perfect rings to dip in the lemon garlic aioli and bouillabaisse brodo. Â The monkfish with mushrooms was light, meaty and savory. To end was a delicious blueberry ice cream to commemorate our celebration. We enjoyed the meal without feeling rushed and just in time to catch our show at the Boston Opera. Definitely a winner!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"44,5,"We had an amazing dinner at Ostra. It was a bit pricey, but worth it. I had the 8 oz filet and shared the grilled corn and parmesan truffle fries with my boyfriend. Everything was delicious. For mainly being a seafood restaurant, they cooked the steak perfectly. He had oysters and the breme. He loved both. He wanted to order a second breme. That's how much he liked it. The bread was warm and delicious. The desserts were great as well. He had the hazelnut mousse and I had the berries and rose. The service was impeccable. It was very quick and attentive. Our waiter and busboy did a fantastic job. They got a little busier as the night went on, so the service wasn't as attentive as when we first got there, but that was to be expected since a large party was seated in our section. The servers and chefs paid attention to details, which made a huge difference. For example, the plates were hot, we received warm towels between our first and second courses, the table was cleaned of crumbs before dessert, and the salt and pepper shakers were taken after dinner. I also appreciated how the, who I assumed was the manager but may have been an owner, helped the staff. I saw him setting tables, talking with guests, and serving some dishes. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"45,4,"My boyfriend surprised me by taking me here on my birthday and it ended up being quite a memorable experience. The interior of the restaurant is so beautiful with a minimalistic aesthetic all throughout down to even the plates and silverware. For our appetizer, we decided on the grilled Spanish octopus which is something I'd recommend as it was simply delicious. My boyfriend ended up ordering the paella for his entree which he was pretty satisfied with and I had the skate wing special of the night. The skate wing was cooked to perfection as it was crisp on the outside but incredibly soft on the inside. To finish off the night, we had the beignets which were actually more like donut holes to me but nevertheless very good.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"46,5,"Legitimately some of the best food I've had in a long time. My family held a private event here before the marathon, so we had the ability to try a number of passed hors d'oeuvres before ultimately ordering our entrees. The one big standout was the crispy maitake mushroom. I believe it was fried in tempura, could be wrong, but it was cooked so perfectly. Easily the best mushroom I have ever eaten. Amazing how something could taste so crispy yet silky, and airy, but so decadent. For entrees we ordered the salmon and monkfish. Definitely the best monkfish I have ever had. It was served in an elegant silver casserole dish, something you'd see being used at the royal wedding, and it was served atop foraged and exotic mushroom ragout with fine herbs, shallots and garlic. So deliciously mouthwatering; cooked perfectly. I'd recommend a hundred times over.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"47,5,"This place was amazing. The food was so fresh and on point. The smoked salmon cake out in a bowl and as the top lifted it smelled like a camp fire. The lobster was great. You can get all kinds of lobster in Boston, but it was really good here. Service was very slow and the wine list didn't have very many value wines. It was a great wine list with hard to get selections, but I look for the value without the ridiculous up charge. For sure this is a place to visit while in Boston.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"48,5,"I am so glad I finally made it to Ostra, because it is now one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. Owned under the same restaurant group as other favorites like Mooo and Sorellina, I had high expectations for Ostra.The restaurant is elegant, chic, modern, and with high ceilings. They seated my dining partner and I upon arrival. The wine list is extensive with a wide range of prices. The complimentary bread was also soft and warm. I have to give credit for our wonderful waiter, who was incredibly courteous and attentive the whole night without being overbearing.I ordered a grilled sea bass, and it was so light and flavorful. The portion was huge too. This is probably the best seafood restaurant in Boston, and I can't wait to be back.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"49,5,"Ostra is on a whole level above most other restaurants in Boston. If you look at the other places I've reviewed in this area, I do give out several five star reviews. However, Ostra goes so above and beyond any of those restaurants! The whole experience was incredible from start to finish.First, the physical restaurant is a work of art. Fish themed decor to match the food is elegant yet trendy. All of the staff is extremely respectful and polite and is willing to do anything to make the experience the best it can be. This restaurant is quite fancy, to say the least. I have been to multiple Michelin Star restaurants before, and although Ostra is not on that level, I would say it approaches that degree of excellence.I need to first mention that this is a long meal. If you don't expect this length (2-3 hours) it may come as a shock, but it is just a part of the experience. The menu is predominantly fish, but there are also other options, vegetarian and other meat. Some highlights include the King Crab, the salt crusted fish for two (I don't remember the name), and the chocolate torte for dessert. The food is rather expensive, but every dish was incredible.Overall, Ostra is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in the Boston area. I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a high class dining experience for a special occasion!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"50,5,"12/17What a fantastic experience! Beautiful ambience yet not stuffy. Excellent service. Hands down, one of the best seafood experiences we have ever had! Succulent oysters and perfectly prepared scallops!

Seafood heaven!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"51,5,"The food is excellent. I love the lobster and paella. The truffle fries, I'm addicted.

Expect to see patrons wearing jeans and a hoodie.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"52,5,"Everything was delicious! We came here as a party of 4. We booked a table through open table the night before (we ate on Monday night at 7pm). If you don't have a car, the restaurant is right between the bolyston and Arlington green t stations.Once you enter, you're greeted by a smiling hostess who asks to take your jackets/bags. Once seated, we were in awe of the restaurant interior design. Everything was simple and nice.But anyways on to the food. Because that's what we're all here for. We ordered 4 appetizers: kale cesear salad, snow pea salad, campanelle, and the calamari. Both the salads were delicious! The amount of dressing was just enough. The snow pea salad was chopped finely and tasted very fresh. The calamari was also delicious, not overly greasy or rubbery tasting. Even the complimentary bread was good and freshly warmed.On to the main dishes, there was a custom vegetarian dish (not on the menu, but just ask for it), grilled sea bream, paella, and pan roasted halibut. Everything again was delicious. I cannot explain it, you just have to go try it for yourself.Lastly dessert! We ordered the apple spice cake and the snow egg. I think the snow egg would be better with a mint sauce instead of basil, but it was personal preference. Both desserts were again delicious but Â the apple spice cake was the favorite for the table.Overall food was amazing. Service was superb. The restaurant was clean and modern. Definitely will come back to try new and have the same dishes!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"53,5,"This restaurant is great at what they do. Â Each time i go it's just as enjoyable.

We chose a seat on the lounge side with live piano music. Ambient was definitely on point!We ordered a dozen oysters (mix of both from MA) and the sea bass tartare. Oysters were really fresh and briny and the tartare was light and we gobbled that up fast!Next we ordered the grilled Spanish octopus and paella. The octopus was very tender and not at all chewy or tough. We shared the paella because our server said is on the big side. Lucky she told us that because it was definitely for 2. It's loaded with mussels, clams, fish, shrimp and a small lobster tail. Delicious! A lot of time paella is on the salty side because of the salt from the seafood but this one was seasoned perfectly.We only had a cocktail each and then sparkling wine and liquor, but the cocktails we had were tasty! So it's good to even visit for an after work cocktail.We will definitely be back in the summer when it's hit dreary outside.They also have valet for those who likes door to door service.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"55,5,Great Food.

We ate and yapping from 7:30pm to 11pm. Delicious food, we like everything we ordered. Refreshing and not too heavy. Excellent service",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"57,4,"A delicious meal for a special occasion. We came here for a double birthday dinner and I was graciously treated this meal by my dining partner. For four, the bill came out to around $500, but we all ordered drinks, appetizers, entree, and dessert each, and left stuffed (unlike at many other special occasion restaurants where the portions are tiny and 'French'). First, the atmosphere is classy without being stuffy. Everyone dining was older (or young couples with their parents), since the restaurant IS expensive, but the service wasn't uptight and gave us breathing room to enjoy our meal. We started off with table bread, which was soft, well-seasoned, and...so delicious I almost ate the entire loaf by myself. My drink was DELICIOUS (I forget what it was called- something ""maid""); I was able to enjoy it and its after-effects happily. I tried the snow pea salad, grilled octopus, and a bit of the gnocchetti as appetizers. The octopus was simply some of the best I've ever had. For our main dish, I ordered the monkfish while my dining partners ordered the seafood paella, filet mignon, and chicken. I tried all but the chicken, and it was all delicious - the paella especially was huge, and I still have leftovers. I picked the monkfish on a whim, and the portion was huge - but I thought it was a bit on the salty side. For dessert, I really wanted the snow egg...but they were out!!! We were relegated to ordered the almond cake & chocolate tarte. As consolation, we were given an order of sorbet. My almond cake was delectable, and I usually don't love cake. We finished the meal with silver-dusted truffles. Overall, a delightful culinary experience, with the price tag to show it. But if there's a special occasion, this is a great place to celebrate it.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"58,4,"Let me start off by saying that this place definitely has the sophisticated, upscale atmosphere, which is showcased in their menu offering (and price point). My fiancÃ© and I came here for dinner and we ordered a few first courses, an entree, and a dessert. Here are my reviews on each of the food we had:1. Grilled Spanish Octopus (first course): Nice apps, too salty in my opinion.2. Fettuccine: If you like truffle or mushrooms in general, I'd highly recommend this one. 3. Alaskan King Crab Tortellini: A must-have! Rich, creamy sauce, not-too heavy in my opinion. The best course we ordered!4. Fillet Branzino (not the Salted Crusted one): Fresh fish, great taste, should be the restaurant's specialty, a bit too salty and sour in my opinion though.5. Snow Egg (dessert): delicate design, appreciate different ingredients within the plate.Giving them a 4-star because I found that most of the food was too salty for my taste. Hope it was just by chance. Other than that, I think they used a great variety of spices that were perfect for a seafood course. In terms of service, we had an instance where the server gave us a new plate yet it was still wet that we had to drain the water by ourselves before eating on it :( Totally not a big deal, but we had expected a stellar service at a restaurant like Ostra. It was a fine experience overall, but it did not extremely stood out. I would come back in the future though, hopefully with a less salty food and a better service!",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"59,1,"Review - 3 starsIt was our second time at Ostra after celebrating our Christmas dinner. The first time experience was amazing: from food, service to execution of each meal. Second time, we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and all the experience was disappointing. Food was pretty good, but service was horrible. There was a huge waiting time between appetizers and food. We ordered a bottle of wine. We had to serve our own wine. The waiter only came to remove the bottle of wine from our table. The waiter disappeared throughout the whole time. We just flew back from a long trip just to celebrate our anniversary, and we had high expectations from this place. If we knew we were going to get this service at this place, we would just have eaten at some good local restaurant.",Ostra,"1 Charles St S Boston, MA 02116"60,4,"Wonderful space in the Boston Seaport area. My friend & I sat at a communal table, which added to the overall experience. Usually am not a fan of tapas, but the plates were right-sized and with 4 plates between us, we were relatively full. Highly recommend the chicken meatballs and the shrimp plate. On a nice day, you've got the choice of sitting outside in the patio area, though the wait can be pretty long. Other plus is that the location is close to a lot of other bars / shops.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"61,3,"Dinner for one this evening, I was offered a seat at the bar or one of the communal tables rather than a two-top. Which is fine, just worth noting. The menu at the bar is the complete menu and the service was great. They have a couple of Greek beers and lots of cocktails.""Avocado 'Tarama' Toast"" to start was delicious. Roe, cherry tomatoes, chili flakes and lemon relish with some greens on top. Great flavor and enjoyed it, other than it's a little tough to slice into and eat. I managed not to spill it everywhere but it was challenging.Main course, the ""Spanakopita Trout"" was a decent piece of trout with spanakopita filling and pickled sea fennel on top. The fish and the filling were great and I enjoyed them thoroughly. The sea fennel is nice to look at, but the pickling was so sharp that it overwhelmed the rest of the plate. I ended up pushing most of it to the side.I'd say, Committee was A-OK.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"62,5,"I came here with a work colleague for dinner. I've got to say, I'm not usually a fan of shareable food / tapas, but Committee was fantastic! In particular, the grilled calamari on a bed of fava was delicious, as was the ground beef kebab.They have a nice little patio outside and all in all the food is also a great value (we shared 6 plates and drinks and the tab was just over $60 each). Highly recommended!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"63,4,"I've passed by Committee for a few times everytime I'm around Seaport area for either work or leisure, and for some reason have always thought of the place as more of a coffee shop. When I found out they serve Greek cuisine with a Contemporary American twist, I got genuinely curious to try and overall I had a great experience! We got here for a Saturday brunch and ordered a few items off the menu: Spanakopita Grilled Cheese (which was excellent - and I actually liked it better than traditional version!) has a nice addition of sauteed spinach and classic tomato soup. We also ordered the Zucchini chips, which was light and great for starter. A visit to a Greek-inspired joint won't be complete without sampling their Mezze - and Committee's had an interesting twist of pineapple which we quite enjoyed. Interiors-wise, the place has a great industrial vibe. It's very laidback, casual, yet classy enough to send a message as one of the eateries to watch in Seaport area. Great for big groups as well as they have plenty of long, communal style seating throughout the space!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"64,4,"Went here for an early dinner with a friend and will absolutely be back.Following other reviewers, we started with the tzatziki trio. I was a little nervous because one was supposed to be spicy but I ended up liking that one the best, but all three were fantastic. They came with the most perfectly soft and toasty pitas. We also ordered the Mango Melitzanosalata, which I would not order again. The fried bread it came with was dense and dry and the dip was just average. Next came the star of the show, the tyropita. It was so good we debated ordering a second. DO NOT MISS THIS. 10/10. We also ordered the beets and the zucchini crisps for an infusion of vegetables and both were delicious. Finally, we ordered the keftedakia, which I would probably not order again because they were much spicier than I prefer and were a little dry, though the flavor was good. I would love to go back to try some other dishes. For dessert we ordered the baklava cheesecake which was really good but by that point I was too full to properly enjoy it.The atmosphere is industrial and though we went early so it was not crowded, the tables appeared very close together and the hightops are separated only by little plants on a long table so I can see it getting very noisy when it's busy. I also do not care for being that close to other patrons. The service was great, both at the bar before we were seated and the waitstaff.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"65,5,"WOW!!! Another credit to Boston in how it has changed for the better, way better. Bless the soul of Mayor Thomas Menino who really started the seaport / waterfront development.There was about seven of us guys reunited. We all grew up together as kids and I was lucky to see so many over the time I was visiting. We sat in the spacious lounge area of Committee and drank, ate, and were very merry! So happy to see each other, catch up and talk trash.Went through a lot of food and wine. At least 5 bottles of some delicious Greek reds. Then food was flowing - Octopus, shrimp skordo, Spanakopita Trout, Artichoke Moussaka, some other items, and of course...Poikilia Kreaton which is a combo of grilled meats: souvlaki, lamb kebab, chicken souvlaki, loukaniko, bifteki served withpatates tiganites, grilled pita, tyrokafteri, and tzatziki.Great service and very spacious!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"66,5,"Outstanding dinner at Committee on a Wednesday night. We loved the decor and ambiance! Our server was so friendly and attentive. We had the tzatziki trio which featured regular, spicy and passion fruit tzatziki. They were all great but we especially enjoyed the passion fruit. We also the grape leaves which had raisins and added a good sweetness. The absolute best dish of the night was the souvlaki (grilled lamb skewers). Perfect cooked with little charred bits, lots of flavor and cut like butter.

Thats really new for me. When we arrived for brunch, the entire indoor seating was empty and some of the outdoor seating was empty as well. We wanted to sit outside but they said that only indoor seating is possible. The drinks and food were really nice, specially the Shakshouka was spicy and yummy. We also ordered pancakes and waffles, both of them were delicious too.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"71,4,"I was working an event at the convention center and was staying at the Westin in the Seaport District in Boston. I have a lot of friends who live in Boston so one of my girls recommended we meet at Comittee. We were originally supposed to meet at The Gathering across the street but it was a Monday night and The Gathering was completely empty, however across the street at Comittee was Poppin, in a great way. I took an Uber over to Comittee to meet my friend, I was able to walk right in. There were several birthday parties going on as well as the place was packed. I had never heard of Comittee before and wasn't sure what type of food it was. What I was sure of is if they had a cow on the menu I could've probably eaten it. I was busy all day and didn't get a chance to eat once. What I knew for sure is that I needed a big martini the size of my face and tons of food. I was really excited to hear that it was a tapas restaurant because I have always enjoyed that style of eating. We ordered the three dip plate that is served with delicious toasted bread. We also order the taziki and chicken skewers. We got the salmon tartare which was delicious. With these four dishes, we were more than full. The drinks were delicious. We had martinis and wine. Our server was awesome. He was in his early 20s and hilarious. Definitely made the experience even better. I was so wrapped up in my food and drink I forgot to take any photos, but trust me. This place is definitely worth it. It is decorated so cool, definitely a hip and trendy Boston restaurant. Prices are affordable especially with how delicious the food is. Bon appÃ©tit.Since this experience I have been back twice, the first time I was out to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, we were able to walk right in and we were given a great spot right in the entrance with our own couch and booth. Without a reservation, it was really nice to have that kind of special service. Our server was Max who was great and very attentive to the birthday girl, he even brought out a delicious flourless chocolate cake for the occasion.The second time I was out with a big group of friends, some are my family and friends from Boston and I also had some friends from Los Angeles in. This time was a little bit trickier because it was a Saturday night at around 8:30 pm. We made a reservation at the door and the host said that it might be an hour to an hour and a half. We were going to be starving by that point, but we put in my name and hoped for the best. We walked to the bar and had a few drinks. I had to check on our table twice, the time kept changing. 45 minutes, a half hour, at this point we asked the host if he could recommend a place nearby that might be a little bit less busy. We decided to stay, and 20 minutes later we were escorted to our table. The food was delicious as always. It is Mediterranean, tapas style so the six of us were able to pass around dishes and all share them and talk about the food. Since we had already been at the bar for two hours, we didn't get any drinks and our tab was only $100. We were able to eat in less than an hour and we were on our way. The service was OK this time.

My dining partner and I ordered the chicken meatballs, the cauliflowers the lamb, the grilled eggplants, and the grilled squid.The prices are OK for Boston, but the portions for the vegetables were laughable.

Grilled as a ""steak.""Grilled Octopus- grilled with olive oil and caper sprouts. Unbelievable. So tender and cooked perfectly!Lamb Souvlaki - I might consider the chicken the next time in. Cooked perfectly but was fatty.Desserts are all made in house and look amazing! Creme brÃ»lÃ©e was killer!Great addition to the waterfront! Will definitely be back!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"74,3,"This is a beautiful restaurant in Seaport. The interior is modern and comfortable. We started with the olive appetizer. It was a portion big enough for two of various Mediterranean olives and marinated garlic pieces. For lunch we ordered the artichoke moussaka and the lamb gyros. The moussaka was moist and delicious with an interesting combination of spices. The pita for the gyros was homemade and delicious. Unfortunately, the lamb was disappointing, composed of bland ground lamb without anything resembling a Gyros taste. Service was good and the bathrooms were very clean. Paid parking is present nearby.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"75,4,"Great location! Love it. Food service was prompt. We had the Tyropita, was delicious but a little disappointed it was flash fried rather then oven baked, zucchini crisps were decent with a tasty yogurt, asparagus fritters were downright bitter and tasted like wet, freshly mowed grass (what I would imagine it was like lol) as well as the Souvlaki- medium rare and spiced to perfection, a definite must have. I definitely want to go back and give it another shot, as I so want to be wowed by the menu to match the location and overall feel of the seaport.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"76,4,"Waked in one evening and were lucky to get a table outside - gorgeous weather! The food lived up to its hype. We had the fried okra, corn and lamb souvlaki - all excellent choices. We will be back!!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"77,5,"I'm used to small and bad Greek restaurants but thanks to Committee I surely changed my opinion. We had fried feta, pork and beef meatballs. Everything was excellent..also we were in Seaport so great location",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"78,5,"If you're looking for a slightly upscale Greek restaurant with a great atmosphere - this is your spot. I came here for Sunday brunch with a large group (10 people) and they were very accommodating. They take reservations, and were fully prepared with a table in the private room near the back of the restaurant. Service was terrific.To start, they bring you complimentary cranberry bread and fig dip - a fun twist on your normal bread and butter. The best dishes were definitely the shakshouka and the baklava oatmeal, and the zucchini crisps were great for sharing. I wouldn't recommend the Spanikopita grilled cheese - it was good, but nothing special! Tasted like a normal grilled cheese and tomato soup combo, and the tomato soup was thicker than I like it to be. All of the drinks were creative and delicious.",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"79,4,"First time trying Greek brunch and it was a great experience! Came here with some friends on a Saturday morning and they seated us immediately. The restaurant is located in Seaport and has very beautiful industrial decor with a wide range of seating options. I highly recommend the shakshouka. We split it between two people and it was more than enough food. Also, the bread they bring out in the beginning is amazing. Service here was excellent and the waiters were very attentive. Will definitely be coming back to try their dinner menu!",Committee,"50 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"80,5,"First - I don't know why Yelp list this as not kid friendly, they have a dedicated kids menu. Seems pretty kid friendly to me. I guess if you lack parenting skills and your kid(s) an unruly jerk who you let run free, the 'Not Kid Friendly' rating is aimed squarely at you. On to the service: Amazing. Even on a busy evening they were extremely accommodating and found space for myself and two elementary aged kids. The service as a whole was more akin to what one would expect from a much pricier establishment. I mentioned my daughter loved the vegetables that came with my plate and they brought a side of vegetable for her. The food: the filet was like butter. No pressure on the knife to cut it and it melted in my mouth. As mentioned, the vegetables were cooked perfectly (just a little bite to them). I will return here anytime I'm in Boston.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"81,5,"Cozy spot in Beacon Hill just north of the Common. Also, it's a block or so away from Cheers, in case you want to do some sightseeing on the way over. I read that the owner of 75 own cheers and a few other spots as well. My first recommendation is to make a reservation on opentable.com. I seem to always plug the site but it saves me time and that hangry look I get from my kids. The place of very intimate. If you are dining, you will most likely be within a 1/2 arms length of any other guests. There are a few smaller tables that offer more room. The bar is a decent size. They have 3 TVs and seating along bar, window, and alongside dining area. When you walk inside there is a table of cheese and crackers that are available to all. Drinks are reasonably prices. Pretty much all beers have ranged from $7-9 and cocktails Â $11-15. For those of you traveling with kids. They do accommodate and very kid friendly. Kid's menu and kid's cups available. I was surprised to learn about this when reading reviews because of the type of restaurant I thought it was, upscale and romantic. It can be a place for a Â date night with some charm, like the several couples we saw or the spot young party goers meet up. Great places for all ages and sizes. The food is exceptional here. I had my eye on the Nantucket seafood stew and the waiter, Jay recommended it as well. Hearty chunks of fish, carrots, potatoes, with 2 pieces each of shrimp and scallops, with several muscles. The stew's broth was flavorful and not overpowering with that seafood taste. My kids went with the pasta. I had to try it since it looked like long curls. My wife said it looked Shirley temple like. The pasta was very good and cooked right. My wife had the ribeye cooked to perfection. For dessert we tried the German Apple strudel with cinnamon ice cream. Oh man, the cinnamon ice cream can stand on its own. Perfect pairing of the two. If you're looking for something different in Boston and want to get away from the more touristy spots by the wharf and North end, then I suggest dining here. Spend some time at the Boston Common and make your way over. Happy eating!",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"82,1,"Just pathetic. Came for brunch and ordered the only two unique New England (lobster) items on the menu: the lobster omelette and Benedict. The only good thing I have to say is that the salad green garnish tasted great.1. The lobster may or may not have been fresh, the cheese in the omelette didn't go well with lobster and it was rubbery. And the sausage links were questionable... which means inedible. The potatoes were equivalent to a greasy diner serving of hash browns. 2. My boyfriend and I left certain that we were able to prepare a better omelette at home. With a better presentation. 3. Folks at the table next to us didn't clear their plates either and left in a hurry. One guest asked for hot sauce and the waiter told him to pick a bottle from the Bloody Mary bar for himself...implying that the guest would have to LEAVE HIS SEAT to serve himself.4. When a brunch place is empty with no line but asks if you have a reservation, you just have to laugh.We should have just been patient and waited in line at Tatte or Paramount for proper brunch.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"83,4,"What a cute American restaurant in Beacon Hill. There is unlimited cheese and crackers, and the free bread that they serve you is nice and warm! There was just one kind of cheese cut into cubes, and it was a great way to keep me happy. There is a small bar area with TV screens, a lot of people were watching the game and cheering. It can get loud during games. If you can score a table by the window, you can people watch. There is a good cocktail list- I went with the Bloody Mary, which was delicious. For my main course, I had the seafood stew. There was a ton of fish in it, and 1 shrimp, and a few mussels. The fish was kinda dry, and not very pleasant to eat. You can also join the 75 club to get special benefits!",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"84,4,"I had Atlantic Cod, 75 French cocktail, and Creme Brulee. Everything was great. I especially like the cocktail. I am not really big fan of alcohol, just a social drinker. So this time I had cocktail with dinner. It was refreshing and nice taste for summer.

I will come back to try another menu.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"85,4,"I came here on a wintry spring day with a friend - I had never heard of it, but as she is a Beacon Hill native, she knew of this gem, off the beaten path of the well traversed Charles Street. We happened to be here on a Tuesday, and in celebration of Taco Tuesday, we both got tacos and I got a margarita while she enjoyed a Corona. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy and warm, and the staff were very sweet and attentive.

We sat at the bar under the large window with a great view of the historic brick buildings and trees across the street. Â Kenneth was our bartender and took our orders. I recommend sitting at the bar for and brunch. Eggs Benedict with salmon - marvelous panoply of yum, especially when beer lovers combine it with an Irish Goodbye cocktail. Professional bartenders provide a whole different level of brunch and booze service. If I lived here, I would definitely become a regular here. Food and hospitality is excellent. Such a nice Street and the design inside is great. Highly recommended to sit at home the high seats under the big bay window.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"87,4,"A snowy Sunday in Boston could have kept us cooped up in our hotel room. What a meal this was! Highly recommended by both Yelp and a friend, 75 Chestnut did not disappoint when we needed a Beacon Hill brunch on a Sunday morning. Walking distance from our hotel, 75C is tucked away in a quaint residential area of Beacon Hill that transforms you back to a foregone New England era. Â Everything about this experience was spot on. Seated quickly (thankfully because it got crazy busy!). Bloody Mary bar was on point. Homemade sticky buns to start - incredible. Lobster omelette, so fresh and tasty. Â I had no complaints about my experience and wish I frequented Boston more so I could enjoy 75C more often. Hope to be back here soon and can't wait to enjoy another great meal.

Cozily situated in one of Beacon Hill's more residential laneways, the picturesque restaurant embodies everything Boston: cute, comfy, and colonial...with the Pats playing on the bar television. While visiting a friend, her parents treated us to Sunday brunch at 75 Chestnut. They made reservations ahead of time, and I'd highly suggest doing the same if you're planning a weekend brunch. There didn't seem to be a terrible wait, but the place was definitely bustling. Their menu was brilliant. I'm often either overwhelmed or underwhelmed with menu choices, especially for brunch places, but I'm sure Goldilocks would agree that 75 Chestnut's menu was just right. Good balance of sweet/ savory / breakfast/ lunch. I hate tomato juice, but my table-mates ordered Bloody Mary's. These beautiful cocktails made me wish I liked tomato juice. You have the option to make your own or leave it to the bar. Both let the bartenders mix their Mary's. My friend mentioned she wished it was a little spicier, and when she sent it back to the bar to add an extra kick, they added chili flakes instead of a splash of tabasco as one might expect. My friend stated that these chili flakes gave the drink a weird gritty texture. That didn't stop her from drinking the whole thing.I ordered the spicy chicken sausage hash; a beautiful blend of potatoes, spicy chicken sausage, veggies, eggs your way, and hollandaise sauce. The potatoes were slightly undercooked. However, overall I was very pleased (and satiated for the remainder of the day!!) My friend enthusiastically ordered the $20 lobster benedict. She stated she'd ordered this in the past, and her only complaint was her eggs were overcooked. Last time, she didn't say anything, but 75 Chestnut ended up comping the dish. She was willing to give it another try. When her dish came, it was beautifully plated with heaps of lobster, but as soon as she cut into her poached eggs, she knew they were overcooked. She was able to pull the yolk out. She sent it back, specifically asking for runny yolks. When the plate came back, one egg was perfectly cooked, but the second, again, was overcooked. At this point, I think she just wanted to eat her breakfast, so she didn't speak up. But honestly, that's where the missing star comes in. Maybe stray from the benedict? There's lots of other good choices.Overall, 75 Chestnut is a solid eatery for a good brunch. Service was good, food was tasty, vibe is casual yet sophisticated. On the pricier side (at least by my Philadelphia standards)/ around $25-30 per person, and parking in this area is pretty tricky. Near some cute little shopping areas and Boston Common if you fancy a post-meal stroll. I'd absolutely come back.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"90,5,Hidden GEM.

The restaurant itself was super cute and cozy with dim lighting and a pretty extensive menu. The food was not as pricey as I was expecting for how nice of a restaurant it is, which was nice. FOOD: My friend ordered the Marinated Tenderloin Tips, which she said was alright. I, on the other hand, was thoroughly disappointed by the Atlantic Cod Filet that I ordered. It was pretty bland and tasteless and the beans were undercooked. Do not recommend that dish. Overall, the restaurant is really cute but the food was underwhelming.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"92,5,"Nice little restaurant in the Beacon Hill area.

Our group of 4 sat near the front entrance window so we could look outside and see all of the nice homes, trees and people walking by. I ordered the filet mignon ($32) which was a smaller portion size believe 6-8oz but it was still flavorful. I opted for the mashed potatoes instead of roasted potatoes. The meat was tender, juicy and delicious! To drink I had the watermelon jalapeno margarita. Hits the spot if you like a nice spicy kick to your drinks! Others in my group tried the clam chowder, steamed mussels, and seafood stew. We all enjoyed our meals. Service was fast and friendly.

Â We had a reservation for 6:30 and were stuck in traffic so I called to let them know we would be late and the woman on the phone was extremely helpful and moved us to another table in the bar area by the window so we wouldn't be rushed out by a party arriving after us.

The atmosphere at 75 is intimate and quaint, but at the same time casual, which made for a lovely setting for our friend's birthday dinner. The food was definitely a little overpriced, but is to be expected for the location. We got the steamed mussels, chicken sausage pasta, pumpkin ravioli, and fish&chips. The chicken sausage pasta had good flavor - really loved the little squash pieces in it - but the chicken was dry. The fries for the fish&chips were a little bland and sad. Overall, there wasn't anything too special about the food, especially for the price, but I would come again to try the drinks, brunch menu, or for the ambience. Our server was very nice and accommodating though. When we told her secretly that it was our friend's birthday, she presented the molten chocolate cake with a candle and scoops of whipped cream & ice cream and took the order off the check. All in all, we had a good time and good conversations. I would just say to CHECK THE BILL because three of us ordered the chicken sausage pasta, which on the menu said $24.90, but we were charged $32.95/dish. We would've paid a good extra $30 if someone in our group hadn't caught that error. We were also charged $2 for ""miscellaneous food items,"" which was probably for the bread and is totally fine, but wish they could've told us. It put a little damper on the night, but mistakes happen and at least our server was quick to correct the bill.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"96,1,"According to yelp 75 Chestnut was a steakhouse. Sadly their uninspired menu only had one steak on the menu. The rest of the menu was as stated above, uninspired and lacked originality.

From the wine, which she must have drank a bottle before making said recommendation because she clearly forgot how bad it was, stated was the ""most popular"" to the salad with everything but the kitchen sink...and our main entree which was the saddest excuse for seafood stew I've ever come across.

I had bookmarked this location well in advance of the trip so that we had a backup plan for meals as soon as we landed.I was super hungry after the flight so we dropped our bags off at our AirBnB and headed over to 75 Chesnut. It was a short walk from our place so that was a major advantage. When we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. Since our bodies were still on west coast time we were quite early for dinner. The menu looked great and it was hard to choose. They had some Mardi Gras specials which the wife was intrigued by. I went for the sirloin steak tips and fries because steak sounded way too good to pass up!The portion was a nice size - perfect for after travel. Enough food to fill me up but not so much food I wanted to fall asleep at the table. Our drinks never went empty but the waiter was not overbearing either. The wife ordered the jambalaya but found it lacking on the heat. She was looking forward to a kick in the tastebuds and felt it fell quite flat. We both opted for dessert to top off the night. I went with the apple strudel. Wonderful. The flaky top was a nice crunch over the yummy, mushy apple and spice inside.It was the prefect portion of food after a day of travel and a pre-sleep. By the time we finished our meal the place was quite packed. Great vibe though. Laughter and chatter all around.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"98,4,"One of the best restaurants in Beacon Hill. Located right in the middle of a residential neighborhood, the atmosphere is super cozy and is overflowing with typical Beacon Hill charm. We arrived a little early for our 8:45 reservation on a Friday night and were seated right away. They have a lovely little cheese and cracker display while you wait. The restaurant is pretty small so there isn't a whole lot of waiting room. Once we were seated our server was really friendly and attentive. We each had a cocktail which were both very strong and pretty pricey, though that should be expected at a place like this. For our meals, I had the pumpkin ravioli and my husband had the turkey pot pie which was really more of a turkey soup. Both meals were great and the portions were large.

Not a bad perk.The bar area is generally buzzing, and they have great (and strong) drinks. The free cheese and crackers are quite the perk too. Downside, prices are a little high - but the food is pretty good. I've had quite a few of their salads and sandwiches, and never been disappointed. Most recently, the steak sandwich was actually one piece of steak, as opposed to tiny or sliced pieces. It's a good sign when you're asked how you want your steak sandwich cooked! One of the best options for a meal in Beacon Hill, in my opinion.",75 Chestnut,"75 Chestnut St Boston, MA 02108"100,5,"Coppa is one of my favorite Italian places in Boston.Order anything here, but especially the pastas, for everything is amazing. If it's possible, sit outside-- it's a nice neighborhood and feels especially peaceful and maybe even a bit like Italy.For an appetizer, try the meatballs, which are delicious. I would avoid the grilled Caesar salad-- I believe that Gordon Ramsey has a mean little bit about restaurants that serve this item; I found the salad fine but just didn't think it was worth the price.The desserts are excellent as well. Try the affogato or the creme fraiche.This place is particularly a gem because it's just one block over from Barcelona but way better (obviously in different categories, of course).

I have never tried it before, so I do not have anything to compare with. In general, it was quite tasty.My friends ordered several dishes.

From start to finish we had a spectacular experience. Coppa started accepting reservations recently, and the city of Boston lucked out. This intimate Enoteca on a quiet corner of the South End is an oasis of explosive flavor and fantastic service. We had an 8pm for 4, and they practically had to remove us from the building at closing time. I started off with the usual ""we are about to order a lot of food, no judgment"" to the waitress. I am not sure why I even feel the need to disclose that, because they probably love that we will up-sell ourselves. We started with drinks: aperol spritz of course for me, and my lovely friends tried the spritz with ginger and rhubarb. Next, we ordered our THIRTEEN ITEMS:Round One: Arancini, Meatballs, Castelvetrano Olives, Duck Prosciutto, Cheese Plate (one goat, one sheep, one cow), fresh bread. Round Two: cavatelli con pollo, carbonara, bone marrow pizza. Round Three: espresso. Round Four: tiramisu, zeppole. We ordered everything at once, and our server expertly timed it all perfectly where the dishes came out in a steady stream over the two hours. It was very much a dinner I remember having in Italy. The bone marrow pizza is life changing. The myriad of flavors is so unexpected and despite it being one of the last things we had, we all made room. I love heat, but will warn my fellow foodies that most of the dishes we had with red sauce had a kick to them, and the pizza had red pepper flakes. If you are anti-spicy, don't forget to ask for it on the side. I thought nothing could ever be the bone marrow pizza level of satisfaction for me, until the zeppole came out. Made with ricotta cheese and served with Nutella, these bad boys are so incredibly light and fluffy, and have not lost their character to the heavy weight of the fried exterior. Absolutely amazing.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"104,3,"Tapas are always either a love/hate kind of experience. There is always a sort of game of chicken and math wizardry when it comes to splitting the portions. How will we split 3 pieces of asparagus between 4 people? Should I pull out the abacus? The service here is excellent, and outdoor dining is very comfortable in the summer. It's pretty dog friendly, as I see tons of dogs walk by and there are bowls of water for them. It can get busy, and a little crowded on the weekends. Our order was a little postponed since there was a huge order of pizza to go ahead of us. The waiter was really attentive and apologized for the tardiness. In terms of drinks, I thought having an option that is completely random called the Bartender's Whim was pretty excellent for a lazy person such as myself. The grapefruit Tom Collins ended up being super refreshing for the heat in the summer.For the food, I think the pasta was a little rushed. The noodles were thick, and I felt like some of them were a little undercooked. Couldn't really taste the sea urchin in the Carbonara con Riccio di Mare. If you are looking for the squid ink pasta, make sure to call ahead, since it is seasonal. The pizza was really good, and the funghi(mushroom) pizza was really fragrant. They did have the option to add truffle on it, but my other friends were cheapskates. I would recommend to ask for extra bread after every plate to soak up the extra sauce. The meat and cheese plates were recommended, but we ended up not getting it, because some people at my table believed we should go to a deli and make our own charcuterie later for cheaper. The pizzas and noodle dishes + copious amounts of bread and water should be filling enough for you before you go bankrupt.

For my entree, I had the prosciutto pizza and it was honestly nothing special.I went to Coppa on a rainy day so everyone opted to sit inside rather than outdoors.

I liked that they weren't oily even though they were fried. -Bucatini Cacio e Pepe: the noodles were really good. I'm not sure if they were made in house, but the definitely tasted like it. -Parma: the prosciutto had a bit of an odd aftertaste but I loved the combination of flavors on this pizza-Nduja: good standard-tasting red sauce pizzaI'm not sure if I would come back here again but I do think it's worth trying once! The service was great too.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"111,1,"In town for the weekend from NYC and my partner and I decided to check out Coppa for dinner. We arrived and there were a couple of people sitting outside as well as inside with some a few open seats available. We get there and waited about 2 min for the hostess to greet us. Table for 2 we told her and she asked if we had reservations and we said no. She looked around and said these tables are reserved and we won't be able to sit you before the kitchen closes. So how is it that Coppa had 12 open seats but refused to sit my partner and I for dinner. You don't get that kind of treatment in NYC, which is basically the food capital of the world! I could understand if it's a large group but I'm pretty sure the restaurant could've made accommodations for 2. Customer service should always be priority and you should NEVER turn customers away.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"112,3,"Not everyone deserves second changes (see Reek from GoT and OJ Simpson IRL) and Coppa might not either. Came here with my gf as she tried to reaffirm her faith in Ken Oringer establishments after a previously underwhelming experience and I too was left wondering if Coppa and Toro should take a paternity test.My gf made a reservation a few days ahead for a 7:30p reservation. The space is small but not claustrophobic, largely in part to the high ceilings, however make sure you don't trip anyone coming out of the kitchen as you wait in line for the single bathroom. Dumb enough to go out for dinner in single-digit weather, we were punished for our decision when we were seated adjacent to the front door. There is a double door, but the stream of reservation-less people in and out was enough to drop the temperature an uncomfortable amount. However there was a small space heater aimed at us, which teased comfort all night.Anyways, onto the food. We ordered the tartare di manzo, bistecca, polpette, lasagna di castana, italian grinder, and a nduja/parma pizza. The tartare was just ok, but the bistecca was amazing ordered rare. The polpette (meatballs) were juicy in the center, however both my gf and I agreed that the taste was solid but not much else. My gf was the only fan of the lasagna but not enough to want to pay $16 for a 2x2 square again. The half-nduja (sausage and burrata) and half-parma (prosciutto and arugula) pizza was a miss for both of us. The burrata was the only enjoyable part of an otherwise lackluster half, while the parma half was so salty and bitter that only a few bites were taken between us. FAIR WARNING: the crust comes very charred. The italian grinder arrived about the same time as the bill and was graciously comped, but otherwise nothing noteworthy to report.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"113,4,"We were in the mood for a non-traditional/non-stuffy type place that served pasta and Coppa fit the bill. We put our names down for a table for two around 6:45 on a Saturday night and were quoted a 45-60 minute wait which turned out to be pretty accurate, as the space is tiny and very popular. For starters, we got two dishes: shaved artichokes with hummus and roe with everything bagel chips (what an unusual combination that turned out to be absolutely delicious and devoured within minutes), and lightly charred brussels with dijon mustard (which was also an interesting twist amongst all the balsamic brussels..a tad too strong on the horseradish though, so for those who can't handle things like wasabi, this may be too much for you). Both dishes were a great way to start our meal. For the mains, we had the urchin and pancetta spaghetti carbonara and cavatelli with chicken sausage. The carbonara was a touch too salty, but still enjoyable especially due to the fresh bouncy spaghetti. The cavatelli had very fresh and subtle flavors, likely coming from whatever spices are used to flavor the tiny bits of chicken sausage. There are no condiments on the table because you won't need any! As for drinks, we got a refreshing grapefruit sangria and a strawberry rhubarb panna cotta for dessert. I normally avoid rhubarb because I find it too tart, and I avoid panna catta because it's usually a bit chalky. Not the case here, every flavor was very well balanced and the panna cotta was smooth and had a very fresh, subtle cream taste. Last but not least, I want to give a big shout out to our server, Marisa. She (and the rest of the staff) were very considerate about my nut allergy and even offered to leave out the nuts from our dishes without me even asking (I know some restaurants are really against alterations/substitutions so I just avoid dishes with nuts altogether but I'm so glad I didn't have to miss out on any of the awesome dishes). Top that off with friendly service, good (and not too loud) music, on a cute and quaint corner in the South End, and you have yourself a perfect Saturday night dinner. I'm normally not into pricey hipster places that put a whole bunch of twists on traditional dishes (I get enough of that in Brooklyn) but Coppa pulls it all off perfectly and is worth every minute, calorie and dollar.",Coppa Enoteca,"253 Shawmut Ave Boston, MA 02118"114,5,When: 6:10 pm (Weekday)Wait time: No wait time (Made Reservation)The time it took to get the dish: 10-20 minutesVerdict:- Funghi in Salamoia: 4/5- Arancini di Fontal: 5/5- Uni Panino: 5/5- Salami Board sampler: 5/5- Parma Pizza: 4/5- Ambiance: 5/5- Service: 4/5- Price: 4/5Overall: 4.5/5 - Great!

If you're adventurous I would definitely recommend both the lingua and duck proscuitto, both so unique and so tasty.- Bone marrow pizza: wow, this pizza is super unique. Didn't see too many chunks of bone marrow itself, but definitely a very flavorful umami-like flavored pizza. Would get this again.- Pig tail special: the night we went there was this pig tail special that was braised and SO good! I'd never had pig tail before and it was actually amazing! Who would've thought!- Spaghetti carbonara con riccio di mare - mmmmm sea urchin pasta. so rich and creamy, very heavy, but get it!- Tagliatelle con sugo - your typical bolognese, and of course, very good.- Zeppole dessert: cute ricotta donuts with nutella, great way to round up dinnerIf anything, come here to experience the most amazing charcuterie board ever.

I ordered the meatballs and one of the pizzas. The meatballs came in three and were spectacular. The beef was great and the tomato sauce was amazing. I had some mixed feelings about the pizza I ordered: bone marrow. I have eaten bone marrow before and loved it. As such, I was intrigued by it as a topping on a pizza. In addition, I saw online reviews that have raved about it. The taste and the smell were definitely different. It took me a slice to get used to the combination. I thought it was good but I am not sure I loved it. I would recommend a more conventional topping (e.g. pepperoni) if you do not want to be adventurous. In terms of the crust, it was very thin. It was like a crunchy flatbread. I prefer the crust thick enough to be chewy and doughy. Nonetheless, the dough and crust were good. The other food I saw other tables order, especially the pasta and charcuterie, looked great. I also ordered a blueberry soda. The drinks are from Maine. Blueberries from Maine are awesome and the sodas are great too.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

Doesn't look like parking is friendly, but note downtown is never easy.Was initially attracted by the signature beef but ended up being a little disappointed. The overall atmosphere was more on the casual side, lights are not as dim as one would imagine in a 3$ French/Italian. With that being said, the interior could be improved as I feel it's a little less than par.The oysters and seafood ravioli was good, on par with other places in little Italy. The beef was what disappointed us a little. I see that the focus was more on the crusted outside than the meat itself, letting the quality and taste of the meat itself fall below par. I also find it uneasy as the crusted exterior constant fall apart from the meat itself though the crust itself tasted pretty good. Something to improve right there, especially when that's the signature. Â Service and price was on par with other place of similar prices.

This was disconcerting.My friends ordered pasta dishes (Cacio & Pepe, the shrimp scampi, and the linguine) which looked and tasted like ramen dishes with a bland sauce. My one friend, a vegetarian, questioned what was in the sauce because it was brown in color, which implied it had beef stock in it. The first waitress said it didn't and it was just white wine, lemon, and garlic. The second wait staff then said it had brown sugar in it, which I've not heard of before. My one friend sent her dish back and ordered fish & chips (which were much better) and they didn't charge us for the switch, which was the right thing to do.I had the steak frites - the steak was undercooked and fries were mediocre at best.

Here's what I got:Cocktails: The Flapper is the perfect drink if you like a cocktail on the sweet side, but not syrupy sweet.Sunday Gravy: overall ok. The gnocchi was a bit stiff and rather chewy but had good chunks of meat mixed in. The sauce was a blend of salty meat broth with tomato sauce, which was interesting.

Friends had cocktails and shared escargot, rarebit (one said it wasn't quite traditional rarebit), and caesar salad (definitely sharing size). I love the outdoor seating. The reason I docked a star or so is that the service was not good. We had to ask multiple times for a third water and for the dessert menu. It was also slow.

We came here twice during a long weekend in Boston due to its proximity to our hotel - the first time was a 4-star visit, the second a 1- or 2-star.First experience: arrived at ~5 for happy hour oysters. We happily slurped down a dozen (or two...), then ordered the beef wellington and brussels sprouts to share. Sat outside in the alley, which was a wind tunnel (menus and glasses flying), but enjoyable given the summer heat. Oysters were fresh, but I thought the other two dishes were pretty forgettable. Beef wellington especially tasted underseasoned and was underwhelming given the price.Second experience: arrived at ~9 for (what else?) late happy hour oysters. Sat at the bar inside given it was a freezing night. The bartender was a bit rude and hard to get ahold of. We ordered a first, then a second plate of oysters. Upon the arrival of the second plate, my boyfriend said that something smelled rotten. I had no idea what he was talking about until I picked up the offending oyster and caught a whiff. It smelled like something had died on the plate many days ago, and may have turned me off oysters for life. Bartender smelled it, seemed entirely unfazed (said ""it's probably a good idea to not eat that"") and charged us for the whole lot anyways. (Side note: we also got the Sunday gravy, which was good - largest gnocchi I've ever seen!)They say that people tend to remember the bad more than the good, and I guess that's true for me and Marliave. 2.5 stars, rounded down because I can still smell that death oyster.",Marliave,"10 Bosworth St Boston, MA 02108"129,5,"I go to Marliave about once a year.

So we decided to split a dessert and ordered a couple of after-dinner drinks. We thought it was interesting that a restaurant like Marliave would offer tapioca pudding for dessert. I haven't had tapiocas in years. I think I might've had it in a hospital the last time, or could've been a diner in Maine. But tapioca pudding here? Isn't this fine dining? Well this must be a very special tapioca pudding. And indeed it was. I couldn't stop saying oh my gawd with each spoonful. They use the big, chewy balls instead of the usual tiny little pearls. The milk custard was insanely rich. It was truly a dessert you have to appreciate because in the back of your mind, you think ""it's just tapioca."" But it's not JUST a bowl of tapioca pudding.

This pie cradles Vermont Cheddar, red onion, bacon jam, roasted broccoli, and Jack's Abbey Beer Mustard. This has so much flavor, and felt quite comforting from the cold outside that evening. I believe it was my honey's favorite of the evening. :) As a bonus, the pizzas from this place REHEAT VERY WELL!!! I reheated all of mine at 350 degrees for just about 10 minutes on a cookie sheet, and it was as if It was still fresh. Â Parts of the crust did get a little too crunchy for my liking, but were still edible and tasty. Â I like that the crust on the underneath re-crisped nicely and made the following day in quite tasty!BONUS: We were sent out a plate of complimentary cheese fries. Simple, cripsy, and as tasty as fries can get. Â I believe they were topped with provolone and green onion. Seasoned perfectly, and piping hot!!! I will be ordering those again to go along with the beer. DECOR: It's a very simple kind of place that feels modern, but I don't think industrial is the word I'm really looking for. I like that the kitchen is open, and you can see your food being made, as well as how open the floor plan is in general. Simple, yet interesting light fixtures, high and low top tables. It seems quite minimal on decor, and I liked it. VERY comfy/casual and good for kids as well as groups in my opinion. Â We'll be back soon!",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"144,5,Oysters and BLTA were bomb. Im from texas so I dont get oysters often. These were goood!!!,The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"145,4,"I only tried their pizza and it was decent. You know those sliced you pick up and kinda flops over? Yea it's those. I guess I could've asked for the crust to be well done? But I didn't know it would be necessary. But the place is so cute! Nice outside area, big tables, good for large groups. The inside is nice and hip ambiance.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"146,5,"Coming back from a long drive and having built up an appetite, me and my lady were salivating for anything that had burrata on the menu. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of ingredients used at the Fork. Wolf Meadow Burrata was on point. Mushroom man pizza as well. Great beer selection to pair with food. Will be back next time in the area!",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"147,5,"This was the first spot we ate in Boston and what a great start to our trip! Thank you fellow yelpers because I really found this spot on a whim based on my group's cravings. The place feels like a neighborhood joint and we got seat for the 6 of us right away at the high top tables. We all wanted local drinks so we opted for beer and ciders. I have to say, I am a big fan of the downeast ciders after trying one here.After having some drinks, a good look at the menu led the group to debate on what to order. We finally settle on ordering a couple pizzas for all of us to share: the Freebird and the Bacon and Tater. Both pizzas were amazing and i don't think I have ever had toppings all grouped together like they have here. Very original flavor combinations. The Freebird had collard greens and as a Southern girl - the place has their collards done right! Love the smoky flavor all around! The Bacon and Tater was comfort food all the way. The creme fraiche really ties all the flavors together and helps the pizza not feel so heavy. The saddest part was that we only ordered enough so each person got one slice... I could have eaten some more of everything.Service was great. Our waiter really listened to us on what we wanted and gave us great recommendations for drinks. You also have to appreciate the industrial vibe of the place. I especially love that they used the cement blocks as a list for their beers on tap by making it a chalkboard with chalkboard paint.Overall, a great hidden find and it really felt like we were in on a great local's spot.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"148,5,"I am soooo mad.... that I don't live near by, as this would be one of my regular lunch places!! Â I had the grilled veggie pita and a Hefeweizen beer. Â The pita sandwich was by far the best version of that I have ever had!! Â It had a great selection for perfectly cooked veggies, and a chickpea salad on the side, and some pickles that included fresh ginger pickles - like the stuff with sushi, but big chunks and made in house. Â Kudos!!!!!! Â Btw. Â The pita was made in house!!! Â  Really great....My son had a great sausage pizza, but he's 16 and really grumpy and won't tell me anything else.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"149,5,"What a gem! Â The hip environment that is fun Â for all. Fresh food, open kitchen environment, excellent service and reasonably priced. Walking distance to Bunker Hill and the shipyard. Â The buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich was incredible. Good portion size with freshly baked biscuit. Terrific homemade pickled sides. Pulled pork sandwich was delicious with a fresh addition of pineapple instead of the usual B.B.Q sauce. The marge pizza was fresh and prepared to order. Good drinks and music too. I would come here again.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"150,4,"This place gets super busy on weekend nights so better make that reservation ahead of time! Oh wait! You can't- it's first come first serve. But that's fine, squirm your way over to the bar and grab one of the local beers from their extensive list. For dinner, the cheese board was amazing. I don't remember what the cheeses were (although they were all local!) but let's be honest, I'll eat anything that says ""cheese."" Speaking of which, the pizza. Wow. Delicious! We shared the tater pizza (had more of a breakfast-y taste) and the special which was a garlic bbq chicken pizza- the sauce was North Carolina style using a vinegar base. The pizzas are pretty small and personal size-ish. I found the price to be a little steep for the amount of food we got. But nevertheless the place is delish!",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"151,4,"What a wonderful find. Great beer with staff that know their stuff.

Our jam is typically the Sunday brunch, but we've been able to make it for lunch and dinner on several occasions.The charcuterie board is great and their breads are sneaky good - I almost want to say some of the best bread in Boston but that seems like a big statement (might be true, though)! A wonderful selection of items on the board, and they gave awesome meat and cheese portions; definitely try the pork rilletes. Pizzas are out of this world and you really can't go wrong with any of them. The crusts are absolutely perfect (fluffy and chewy on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside and a nice flavor) with fresh ingredients. My favorite is the clam pizza, or anything with an egg on it - but they're all good.Awesome beer selection with plenty of local micro brews. Decor is unassuming and modern, with a natural/organic flair inside - I'd call it hipster chic, without the douchie-ness of the hipster part.No reservations is a bummer and you might wait a while for a table between 7-8:30, but it will be well worth the wait.

Industrial meets fun outdoorsy decor.Drink selection is good. They have a rose sangria! Really winey and refreshing for a hot summer day.We had the pizzas and cheese board. Both very delicious. The Spaniko-pizza was my favorite! You can order half and half pizza too which is good if you want to try more than one pizza.Great place to come if you're near the water in Charlestown for lunch or an afterwork drink.,The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"154,3,"This place is so hipster, so trendy, so cute, I loved the decor. There were a lot of children also, which seems to be the standard for any place that serves craft beer in a trendy millennial neighborhood, so this wasn't really a surprise. After reading reviews we decided to come on the earlier side which was a fantastic idea. We arrived right around 5:00 on a Saturday night and scored a free(!!!!) parking spot right in front, there was hardly anyone inside so we also got a comfortable table. They were completely packed about 45 min after we arrived. They have a very good beer selection and our server was really knowledgeable when it came to helping us select from their extensive menu. For food, we shared a cheese board which came with some great selections. I really appreciated that they had a chalkboard on the wall that listed what is included on the cheese board and charcuterie board (which changes regularly), rather than just saying ""chef's selections"" like you see in many other places. That helped us to decide not to waste the money on the charcuterie board when we saw things listed that we knew we didn't like. The pizza is what brought this review down to 3 stars from 4. My husband and I have very different ideas of what makes a good pizza and I appreciated that we were able to do half and half on one pizza rather than buying 2 whole pizzas. My half of the pizza was a pulled pork, kale, horseradish, and red onion that was one of the specials. I really wanted to like it but it was overwhelming with horseradish. I am one of those people that likes horseradish and all things tangy but this was incredibly overpowering. My husband's eyes were watering from across the table. It was also under the cheese and other toppings so it was very difficult to scrape it off the other slices. The other half of the pizza was the mushroom which was good but honestly I don't remember much about it because my mind is clouded by my poor pizza. I won't be rushing back but I am willing to give it another shot and try out a different pizza that hopefully is better than the one I tried this time.",The Brewer's Fork,"7 Moulton St Boston, MA 02129"155,5,This was a unique restaurant with great beer and wine options as well as food choices. Small plates and a huge variety of off beat pizzas. Homemade top quality! Was our first night in Boston and will definitely stop back by and ohhhh no matter what you order add an order of meatballs.

With so many great choices it can be difficult to narrow down where to go. If you choose this place, you won't be disappointed. The food was amazing compared to other Italian restaurants of similar stature. It is located right in the heart of the Italian district making it a great place to spend time. I tried the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, and as a consistent Italian food goer I can proudly say it was one of my favorites. When I came here I spent $576 but that was on 12 people so it averaged about $45 per person. With a large party, we reserved the top floor which made for a great view. The service was great as the waiters were very nice and quick to refill drinks. The food came out fairly quickly, though it took a while to get seated initially. None of the orders were messed up so the kitchen did a good job fulfilling the orders appropriately. Overall, it's a great choice that I recommend you trying.",La Famiglia Giorgios,"112 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"161,3,"My friend suggested this restaurant , so we checked it out. Its a nice homey kind of feeling. We ordered chicken parmigiana Â (which comes with penne or linguine pasta) and mozzarella sticks. Â The mozz sticks were yummy. the chicken Parmesan was huge, easily shareable between 3 people.

Â Can you believe this price in Boston? Â They immediately served us with Italian Bread and Wine. Â The House Salad followed and were humorous and fully seasoned with iVinegar and Oil but adding Parmigiana Cheese made it so good that we couldn't believe it was not a complete meal and was part of a 3 course meal. Â The salad was followed by our Entree - Mussels with Garlic Sauce on Linguine and Chicken Parmigiana over Linguine with Marinara Sauce. Â We would have been so stuffed that we decided to share the Mussels (Left over seafood is not as good as left over meat) and just sample the Parmigiana and take 2/3 of it home and left room for the Mini Cannolis. Â After being satisfied we were pleasantly surprised that this meal was the least we spent on all Dinners and some Lunches we had in BostonWe had an epic dinner (albeit an early special) and was told they gave $8 Lunch SpecialsHighly recommend!!!!",La Famiglia Giorgios,"112 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"163,4,"Remember when you went to grandma's house when you were a kid and she served you some stuff that you didn't know what it was, but your mom told you to eat it, and so you did. Then over the years of eating it you started to like it and ate more of it. Then your grandma got that smile and piled a mountain of it on your plate and said eat eat eat! That's what this place is like. It's like eating at grandma's house where the recipe has been cooked the same way for generations, handed down on scraps of paper or for the really good stuff, never written down, just whispered in your ear. This place has it's following because you feel like you are at your Italian grandma's house and they stick to the basics of family home cooking. It's not haute cuisine or big bold flavors, it's old school Italian family cooking at it's best.I had the Veal Saltimbocca: veal, mushrooms, prosciutto, mozzarella, butter wine sage sauce $22.99 with fresh gnocchi $3. Veal is hard to come by on the West Coast because it is felt to be politically incorrect. Luckily, your Italian grandma on the North End Boston doesn't know who PETA is. ha ha, just kidding. It was quite good and as expected at grandma's house you get a mountain of it. I could barely finish half of it. I would order this again but get spaghetti instead on gnocchi. I am kind of fussy about gnocchi. I loved the veal, understated elegance and cooked to perfection. My chicken saltimbocca is work in progress, but grandma has it dialed in. If you want Italian home style family cooking with massive portion sizes, this is it. We came here for our anniversary with our daughter and her fiancÃ© and had a very memorable meal.

Luckily, our waitress gave us some recommendations. You get to pick your sauce and pasta. Trust me, order the homemade pasta...it's so worth the extra 3 bucks! I got the marina sauce with the fettuccine and added meatballs (the size of a house!). The sauce was fresh and bright and the meatballs were delicious.

That always means the food is BOMB. We waited about 30mins to be seated and w/ two staving kids, it wasn't easy. But so worth the wait.

I believe that each room has its own menu as well. My friend and I opted for the front room where there is an open kitchen! I was ravenous when and small plates are always the way to go - you get to try a little of everything! We ordered:Chicken wings - these had sesame seeds and a really good crunch. Crispy Potatoes - these were definitely the most memorable. The aji amarillo aoli is so tasty. The potatoes were right out of the fryer - they were very hot and crunchy. Cheeseburger - my friend and I split this. It was a little larger than a slider and definitely a good choice. Soppressata - this was a weird mix of ingredients - potato, onion, horseradish leaf pesto. I think I would have liked it a little better if it was plain pesto.

We split a pizza and some drinks, which were fine, the dessert was not great though. It was some kind of banana/chocolate/hazelnut combo and I really don't recommend it, although it was plated nicely.Service was quick and friendly, and the thing I really liked about it was the board games available to play while you eat/drink.

Sinfully good.-Pancakes: I believe it was caramelized pineapple or something similar when I went, but it changes. It's a super thick pancake (it looks like one of those rice cooker pancakes except not quite as thick), soaked in syrup and butter. It is one of the most unique pancakes I've ever had, and it was fantastic.-Donuts: Oh, the donuts. These are the ones I dream about. The flavors are constantly changing, but we got orange cream and Samoa/Caramel deLite-flavored donuts. They were soft and delicious and thiccccccI think I should go back now.",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"189,3,"We went here for brunch after I ran the BAA half; it was good food and a cute spot, but the menu was pretty limited for someone who was vegan (my roommate), dairy and gluten free (me), and allergic to nuts (another roommate). We did make it work; the food was good but not fantastic. My roommates got donuts that they loved though!I would definitely give this place another chance for dinner or for drinks; I think also for pizza aka for those who aren't gluten and dairy free, this place would be great.",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"190,2,"The restaurant - once you walk through it's seemingly random and completely opposite brother bar - is beautiful. Great decor and vibes and much nicer than the entrance lets on. However, the restaurant was freezing - the fireplace merely a facade. The food was mediocre at best. We all should have gotten the pancakes, which were great. The donut holes were dry and hard and tasted like they had been sitting out for a day or so. The huevos rancheros and shakshuka both came highly recommended but were incredibly salty and lacked any other flavor. We also waited almost an hour for our food - do not come hungry.. Our server was wonderful and the bloody mary was excellent. Overall, after the ill-advised hype and a two+ hour brunch that should have been an hour max it was not worth the price and I would not make the trip to go back.

The more casual bar w/ fun bar games/game watching up front, and the ""explorer theme"" more fancy (though still casual) back. The Club Room.The small plates were amazing. The quinoa and pork bowl, the quoahog, the chicken dish (WOW) and pork/shrimp wontons were all really, really good.

All it takes is one scenario to play out in which the customer is dissatisfied to loose other potential customers. That is why its so important to be professional as an owner, but apparently not this one! My husband's cousin who is one of the sweetest person I know was at this establishment to celebrate her sister's boyfriend's birthday and when she ordered a drink was asked for an ID. She presented her ID and was told it was fake. (she is close to being 30!) She asked to speak to the manager and she was rude to the point of even using profanity. All I know is that at the end of the story the cops came to prove this was a legitimate ID and a report was filed. This story made me pretty upset and that is why I am sharing this here. I hope the owner/manager learns her lesson that customers should be treated better.

I asked to speak to a manager and was directed to a woman sitting at the bar. She was annoyed that I was interrupting her evening with friends, but how is that my fault when your staff directed me to you? I calmly explained the situation, and she was dismissive and kept talking about how she's not working. A few of my friends who had experienced the same treatment at the bar came around and multiple people were talking at once, but the situation escalated when she jumped up from chair, got in my face, and yelled ""OK BITCH! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!"" How professional. It took everything I had not to react physically (read: slap the shit out of her) with her finger pointed in my face so aggressively.

There's board games and shuffleboard and other fun things. Went for Sunday brunch and there didn't seem like there was many people but service was still so slow. Took forever for my friends to get their drinks. They give you bottles of water for the table. Our waitress took our empty bottle and never came back with it filled. And whenever the waitress came by, she barely looks at us so it was difficult to get her attention.I had high hopes for the food. But after seeing my food when it arrived, I was so disappointed, especially since everything on the menu isn't cheap and over $10. I came here really wanting to try their Smoked Salmon Pizza that I saw on their online menu. But They didn't even have it on their menu today.**FOOD**RED QUINOA - this sounded good on the menu. Said it was gunna have quinoa, avocados, scrambled eggs and some veggies. I was imagining a small breakfast bowl with some toast. My small, sad little plate came out with a big green gloop with some quinoa mixed in. The veggies were on the side with 2 unripe slices of avocado. I was literally so confused when I saw my plate. Where are the scrambled eggs? I guess it was mixed into the green mush which is supposed to have walnut pesto. The mush did not taste like eggs or pesto. It was SO bland. Might as well have eaten straight up plain quinoa. The charred broccoli was good and that was about it. And there was no toast to go with this. $14 LOLGREEN SHAKSHUKA- my friend go this and I didn't get a chance to try it. I've had Shakshuka before and it's delicious. This was green Shakshuka and I have no idea what that is but it looked just as sad as my red Quinoa plate. It did not come in a griddle they usually do. It was a small plate with an attractive blob of what looked like scrambled eggs with mixed in. At least this dish came with toast.SHISHITO PIZZA- this was actual pretty good. Mostly because you can't mess up pizza. They do have an actual pizza oven in the kitchen. Â Shishito is apparently some kind of green pepper. Had shishito, potato slices and prosciutto. POTATOS (side) - probably my favorite thing we ordered. Literally just a side of potato's with some aoili sauce. It's small round potato's but they make it really crispy on the outside. Â Maybe their other stuff is good. But if you try this place out, ask the waitress what everything is before you order anything. Don't assume things like I did because it was definitely NOT worth paying what we paid for the food we got.",Tapestry,"69 Kilmarnock St Boston, MA 02215"200,4,"Closer to a 3.5 star, but rounding up cuz I'm feeling generous. The corned beef hash breakfast toast didn't disappoint, but the small portions left a bit to be desired especially for the price. The pancakes and other sweet items looked more substantial.

Would probably come again.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"201,3,"Boston was a one night stop for our family trip, unfortunately. Â BUT....we all hate seafood.  I know, why come to Boston?!? Â Um, History, Family, and to hopefully find other great eats. We came here for dinner after seeing they had a food option for vegetarians. First of, it was confusing. Â There was a sign that says ""Order Here"". When we went to that sign, the waitress seemed frustrated with us. Â So she rushed us to a table and walked away. Â From that point forward she just seemed mad at us. Â I get people have horribly hard days in the food service industry. Â I made sure we all had our orders ready when she came back. We ordered and waited for more water. Â It was so damn hot out. Â Like 89 without the heat index, and we were walking that ALL DAY. Â We ordered more than just water, but seriously, we were going through it so fast, just bring a pitcher or carafe. Â The place wasn't full by any means. Â  Â I had the steak frites, which was delicious. Â I would have licked the plate if my spouse didn't give me the ""don't do it eyes"". Â Kids chicken tenders were ""fine"", they said. Â Friend had a burger that was ""ok"". Â We also had a salad that was rated as ""fine"". Â So, I guess if you are going, get the steak frites.

Having heard the lines can be quite long on the weekends, we opted to visit around 8:30 on a Monday morning.We were greeted and told to wait in line to order. You cannot save a table - you have to order first, then they will seat you. We thought for sure we'd be stuck without a table because of the amount of people ahead of us, but apparently the turnover is fast enough that it wasn't a problem. The line was still a bit long and wrapped around the really tight area, thus blocking the two bathrooms. We watched them cook as we waited, and I'll say they work rather quickly. We were about 10th in line, but still waited about 15 minutes before being able to order.Because we apparently share a brain, Sonya and I placed identical orders for the nutella waffles with strawberries, but no bananas. But once our food arrived, the excitement gave way to disappointment. The strawberries had clearly been frozen (they hadn't entirely thawed), and the nutella looked just like Hershey's syrup... it was quite thin and barely tasted like nutella. Though we didn't want to mix nutella with syrup, the waffles were just too dry so we used the syrup on the table. The waffles themselves were bland and a bit dense, not the fluffy kind I was hoping for.This was mediocre food... and we waited in a line for it.

Â How these guys keep everything in order? No clue. The chefs taking orders never stop. Order after order after order. And somehow, they keep it all together. Very impressive. The staff is nice. Although the entire operation is a mess, they keep their cool and get things done the right way. Everything is priced fair. Â If something has their ""smoked feta"" then I recommend you order it. Knowing what I know now, would I wait that long again for this place? Probably not. Â The wait can get long. Our line was right up to the front door and we waited almost 25 min to order.

Their gluten free waffle was amazing! The price gets a little pricey with toppings which is understandable considering how much they loaded my waffle with strawberries. GF Waffle with no strawberries wouldn't been $8. They are set up a little different then most restaurants. You walk in to place your order and pay then you set down.

Â The menu is large and well-varied between savory or sweet options. More importantly, though, the food was great. Hot, well-portioned, and a great combination of flavors.The not-so-good: The line can get incredibly long, it probably took us 20 minutes to order, and when we left it was even longer.

This place was a hot topic on Boston food blogs and came recommended by several of the Uber drivers I met. I ordered the Boston Cream Pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs and sausage. The pancakes tasted exactly as it sounds like a Boston Cream Pie! I thought it tasted great! The eggs were simple and the sausage was decent. The portion size was huge. My fiancÃ© ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs. The corned beef hash although was a large size portion it was not the greatest tasting. If you are a corned beef hash enthusiast you will likely not like it. The place was fairly expensive for a breakfast stop. Without even ordering drinks the above meal costed $46. The ambiance was very crowded. Although it does have a nice flow allowing you to find a spot to eat, you will likely be rubbing elbows with customers waiting in line while you are eating your breakfast. The customer service was fair and so was the cleanliness. In my opinion, this is a place you try once for the experience.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"211,5,"Brendan and Becca:Made a quick pitstop into The Paramount on Charles St. in late morning. Upon entering, you are immediately struck by small town diner charm. They have an interesting: order first, pick up your food, and then get ushered to a seat by a host/hostess system - kind of bewildering at first if you don't know the gig, but in sitting there for just 10 minutes you learn that they've got it down to a science and keep the restaurant pretty high throughput. We both chose lunch sandwiches, but it was a close call because the breakfast options they were still offering were pretty enticing. I had a Mediterranean inspired chicken and mozz with pesto sandwich. It was a well-portioned, well-executed sandwich. Wouldn't change a thing about it. She had a chicken salad wrap with french fries. Also well-executed and very enjoyable. Definitely will be back to try more of their delicious looking breakfast options. Would definitely recommend to a friend.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"212,5,"My husband chose this location for breakfast before our walk to the public garden. Upon entering, I noticed the long line and I saw only booth. So I was about to walk to go save it, but at the same time we were politely told to wait in line to order/pay and then be seated. So we gave it a go. The line was a double line and very cramped but once you get to the counter you watch them cook your food in front of you. We waited for a minute or 2 and we were surpisngly seated. The system works. It seemed to push some people away, but give it a go! You will be surprised. We ordered the caramel & bananas french toast and cinnamon french toast with nutella, strawberries and bananas. The sizes are HUGE and they are DELICIOUS!

You are immediately ungulfed with the smells of breakfast as you enter and make your way to the 'order here' sign, and it only gets stronger as you approach the kitchen. Best part about it all is the interaction you get with the chef as you yell out your order from the middle of a hangry mob. Then as the procession of the single file line continues down the window between you and the food, you feel the heat of grill as your eggs are cracked into it's surface; you taste the hit of paprika in the air as the homes fries are dressed; and you melt as the butter is spread on the bread.

My husband and I came on a lovely spring Saturday early afternoon and the first thing we noticed was the long line. Well, if THAT many people like it, it must be good right? We decided to take a chance. We didn't realize their seating policy until we got inside. The seating policy is that you don't sit until you get your food, and when you are ready to sit there will most likely be a table open. So basically you are waiting in line for a long time (for us it was, no joke, close to 40 minutes) and then not 100% guaranteed a seat, though for the most part we realized there was always a table open when needed. Seems risky tho! While you are waiting in line, you're trying not to bump the people eating and constantly needing to squeeze out of the way of the servers. The staff clearly has a system down that seemed to be efficient, but I think on any day less than a Saturday early afternoon it would have been much less chaotic and cramped and the whole experience a little more enjoyable.The good part is the good is VERY yummy. I had the avocado sunrise open-faced toast and my husband had the chorizo omelette. Both tasted great and were flavorful and colorful. We felt like we had to eat quickly, though, because we knew there were so many more people waiting to get a seat. We didn't talk much when we ate. We had done most of our talking in line and were too hungry to talk when we sat down to eat! Â Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here, at least not on a weekend. But I would recommend trying this place if you're in the area on a weekday morning or early afternoon because the food really is good.",The Paramount,"44 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"216,5,"Amazing. Simply amazing. Been coming here for years and the huevos rancheros never disappoint. The tortillas are hot, the eggs are perfectly fried, and the mix of beans and potatoes and avocado mix perfectly. The line is long as you know, but I really love their unique way of getting everyone a table as soon as they have their food. It really works!Other than that, we split a burrata-tomato-avocado fried egg meal, which was heavenly. The burrata portion was huge, something you'd easily pay $15 for at a nice restaurant. It paired really well with the eggs and tomatoes. Must try! Especially with a nice mimosa to start the brunch off properly. Pros:ServiceHuevos rancherosFoodMimosas - strong pour for only $5Atmosphere - no frills, just foodCons:Long line can lead to a long wait.

It's really intriguing watching him prep all the meals and he cooks them right in front of you. Once the food is ready and you pay for it, they open up a seat for you! The only issue is that the wait is really long on the weekend but that isn't the restaurants fault.

""What should I get"" my response each time, french toast. Guess what they ended up getting not french toast! Sorry, just had to vent really quick.French Toast was very good borderline great. I would go back to this place for french toast. Crispy exterior and a cushiony soft interior. Great flavor, only optimized with the caramel sauce and bananas.

Fresh, but not cooked well and they are huge without anything to make them special.

The duck drumsticks with sweet and spicy chili sauce were delicious and the French fries with bacon and cheese even more sinfully delicious. We shared the above but I ended my meal with the kale salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing that I substituted for the listed dressing. It was great. My friend ordered a different salad and I took one look and ordered mine instead, happy I did. The drinks were good, my friend ordered cocktails and I sipped wine and then ginger ale with bitters after the french fries hit home but for the Love of all things fried I'd do it again. Great place, the front is the bar area with a few scattered tables but the back is actually quite enticing with romantic mood lighting. It's also a great date night location without the quiet and/or expensive intimacy. After all it is a gastropub!!Go enjoy, bring your tums if your not used to unhealthy kind of delicious food.

At my dining table, we had to shout just to barely hear each other it was so loud and overwhelming. Ward 8 should cap how many people they accept into their bar area. Additionally, when we went to use the bathroom, it was utterly disgusting. There was wetness all over the floor, a straw and lime in the sink, and a COCKTAIL GLASS in the toilet. We had a $200+ meal and that bathroom was worse than a porta-potty. But that is not even the worst part.About 3:30 AM after my dinner at Ward 8, I woke up to the worst food poisoning I have ever experienced. It was violent and lasted for 24 hours. I was throwing up, had major chills, a terrible headache, and a high fever. I called to let them know what had happened.

Food:There just wasn't anything special about the food. The fries were pretty good but the oysters didn't taste very fresh. The duck wings were just okay. And the lobster roll, although surprisingly inexpensive, was fairly meh as well (nice touch is you can get one roll warm and the other cold if you want, although I tried one of each and was left unimpressed, especially with the warm one). My fiancÃ© got the ribeye and it was almost half fat, which was quite disappointing. Drinks:The names were very interesting and they sounded delicious. Unfortunately my drink was just okay (although it looked really neat!) but my fiancÃ©'s drink was very refreshing and delicious.Service:The service was probably the best part of the night. Our server was very attentive to details (especially for my fiancÃ©'s allergies). Decor:The place looked cool from the few pictures on yelp but inside it just looked like it was arranged very poorly with the tall, giant bar in the middle and then clusters of small tables on three sides of the room. You'll know what I mean if you check it out. Impression: I feel like it looks like a place I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar and grabbing the right drink and the right food; I just don't know what to really recommend, but it's probably one of the less expensive places in the area.

Recommend the poached eggs over the salmon potato cakes and the bucket of bubbles with a variety of juices on the side. They also have great big salads,Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"228,4,They didn't have steak the day I went unfortunately. I got the half chicken instead and it was good. The tuna sandwich was a bit bland though. The servers were friendly but I found the service to be better than the food.,Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"229,4,"Overall: Solid drinks and attention to detail help Ward 8 stand out among other bars in the area.The good: A good bartender makes a huge difference no matter where you go, and we were lucky to be paired with one who asked for our taste preferences to recommend drinks. Then he crafted our choices and delivered some quality drinks (in my case, the Black Widow). And, they were effective, no skimping here. The presentation is also well done, from the glassware to the bar area and lighting.The not-so-good: By the time we were wrapping up, the atmosphere had changed quite a bit and was suddenly loud and busy, which was quite different from the low-key vibe when we entered. It was starting to get shoulder to shoulder. The music also changed to match that new vibe.Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 10/10Drinks: 9/10",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"230,4,"I really like this place. I used to work near North Station and would sometimes go to Ward 8 for a nice lunch. What prompted a review now is that I went last weekend with a friend before the Janet Jackson concert at the Garden.It was a Sunday night and it was super busy at 7 PM. I'm glad I made a reservation! I'm thinking it was that busy because of the concert. Everyone pretty much cleared out at the same time. Kudos to them for playing Janet Jackson music all night. Ha!Downsides first because they are small - it can get very loud in there. With the number of people and the music, my friend and I were yelling at each other across our small table. It's also a little cramped in there and some weaving & waiting had to be done to get to and from the bathroom in the back. Lastly, it took a while to get the check. All pretty small things, which is why this place still gets 4 stars from me.The food is delish. I've never had a bad meal here. Last week specifically, I got the cobb salad with chicken. Now, I'm not a big salad fan. Or veggie fan. Or fan of healthy anything. Lol. Hence, the cobb salad versus one without bacon. BUT, it still made me feel good about myself to get something with green in it. Let me tell you that the salad was BOMB! I've had cobbs other places. This one was delicious. The chicken was plentiful, juicy and tender. The bacon and egg mixed in brought it all together. The amount of dressing was perfect - not too little, not too much. I would actually go back there just to get another salad (how weird!) :-)For a drink, I got the bees knees. I've also had this cocktail elsewhere, but somehow, the Ward 8 version was elevated. It was sweeter than other ones I've had. I had to hold myself back from ordering another one.All in all - this is a really good restaurant with tasty food and drink options and fresh ingredients. I'll keep coming back as long as they keep up the good work. Remember that reservation if there's an event at the Garden!",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"231,3,"I really wanted to love this place but just couldn't. My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday dinner which slowly turned into ""gets get drinks and Â an appetizer instead.""We ordered the five layer dip and chips to start the evening. I can't have any dairy and asked beforehand if there was any dairy in the dip because it looked dairy free on the menu. The waitress said that there was sour cream in the guacamole and additional sour cream in the dip, both which I asked her to omit. She wrote down that I had a dairy allergy on her server notepad which I appreciated and about 15 minutes later we got the appetizer. It straight up looked like it was swimming in sour cream. After trying a bite, I confirmed that it was, in fact, sour cream and my boyfriend was kind enough to scoop all the sour cream out of the way so I could meagerly munch on the remaining dips on the bottom of the dish. It honestly took about another 15 minutes for the waitress to come and tell us that- oops, there is sour cream in the onion dip!For someone to note a food allergy and not follow through with the kitchen about it was very perplexing and disappointing as a person with dietary restrictions. The dip also wasn't anything special to write home about. If you have any dietary issues or would like raveworthy food in the North End, I would look elsewhere.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"232,3,Came here for some cocktails after dinner. The place was pretty crowded but we were lucky to find two seats at the bar. The bar tender was really nice and friendly but he was so swamped he was't able to even take our order for about 15min after we got seated. Once he finally got done with all the orders we got our orders in and our drinks within minutes. Drinks were great and really strong which I enjoyed. Atmosphere is loud and dark but great place to catch up over drinks.,Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"233,1,"Pathetic. Asked for 3 old fashioneds for my party of 4 and got a snotty reply saying ""what kind? The $30 kind?"" Aside from the insinuation that I couldn't afford a good drink, the bartender described herself as a ""b*tch after 11,"" and walked away. Shortly thereafter, I indicated to another bartender that I had been unable to obtain decent service from his colleague and asked again for 3 old fashioneds, immediately specifying the whiskey type this time. He refused to serve a member of my party who has a mental illness (but who is harmless, completely sober, and wasn't even going to be drinking alcohol), despite saying the member of my party seemed ""polite"" and despite me clearly ordering 3 drinks for a party of 4. We started to walk out and I noticed they had an air of humor about my party. I strongly expressed disappointment about how we were offended and left. I suspect they dislike customers who come by after the Garden, as they were quick to ask if we had been to a show. Kind of like the people who move next to a farm and complain about the smell. Except worse. Did I miss the memo? Is this place a cocktail bar affiliate of Dick's Last Resort? If so, you need a new business model. If not, you need new bartenders. We went to a competing bar and spent $250 where we received no additional insults from unctuous hipsters.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"234,4,"One of the better food options around north station. I Â normally come here for lunch. I would recommend their duck wings and roast beef sandwiches. But to avoid food coma, salads are my go to. They are normally chopped up and well seasoned. Avocado salad might look very underwhelming but mixed herbs added layers of flavor, carrots and sesame seeds give it an additional crunch. It's quite filling without adding protein.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"235,2,"Restaurant was trendy, the atmosphere was good. No ac...on a hot summer day couldn't even stand to be in the restaurant. Food looked good on yelp...",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"236,3,"If you check out my last review for this spot you might notice that it previously had a higher rating. This isn't necessarily because it's gone down in quality, but simply because this time around I was able to judge the spot more accurately. My boyfriend and I came to the restaurant in the winter (two whole years after our first visit) and were quickly seated at a table. We came around 7pm and the place was pretty busy, in fact, the entire back section was taken up by a single party. Luckily we'd made a reservation and were quickly sat at a table near the bar.We started the evening off with a few cocktails, I can't remember which ones currently, but I do remember them being pretty to look at and nice to drink (albeit a touch on the expensive side). We asked our waitress what was good and she was unable to give us a proper recommendation, sorta shrugging and saying it was all ""good"".We wound up ordering the BLT pork buns, fried cheesesteak dumplings, maple chilli duck wings and the five layer dip. The food took an excruciatingly long time to get to us, over thirty minutes, and some items were lukewarm by the time they arrived. While the food was quite good (even at lukewarm temperature) I thought it was definitely overpriced. The pork buns are like 9 bucks and honestly aren't that different from normal pork buns! Because we ordered numerous items and our table was so small we did our best to finish our dishes quickly (which isn't too difficult considering the tiny portions) but our waitress would regularly pass by us without clearing the table, despite it being quite obvious that the space was too little to hold all our orders comfortably.One reason why I'm giving this place an average rating is that since my initial visit the vibes seem to have changed, becoming a bit more divey than I'd like (although that could have just been the clientele for that evening). The subpar service is the other reason.I wouldn't say you should avoid this spot entirely, it does have some positives (interesting drinks and pretty good food), but the price seems a bit much for what you're getting. I'd maybe consider getting brunch here another time, but for now I think I'll pass on dining here again (I will still order the duck wings though).",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"237,4,"I really liked this place. Came here for brunch one Saturday morning and was able to be seated immediately. Cool digs (we sat near a giant floor-to-cieling window which they graciously had open for us to enjoy), and ""hip"" atmosphere was modern but not overbearing. The food was also really on point. I had a modified version of the English muffin sandwich, which was yummy af (although, since I'm not a huge sausage fan [lol, pause] I asked for bacon on it instead which I wish they would have at least folded for me given that the straight unbent pieces made the whole thing incredibly unwieldy). And lastly, the cocktails were right as rain.Go here.",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"238,4,"I popped by Ward 8 during lunch with a colleague. The restaurant was empty when we arrived at 12. Throughout lunch, there were a few other patrons, it seems this is more a dinner spot. The service was quick, I placed an order on sweet chili duck wings ($12) and ginger miso salmon ($24). It was my first time seeing duck wings on any menu - surprisingly it was delicious! Tender, juicy, and the sauce was just sweet & spicy enough without going overboard. The ginger miso salmon was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous, accompanied by healthy quinoa pilaf with strawberry bits.I'll be sure to check out the night scene and dinner food in the foreseeable future!",Ward 8,"90 N Washington St Boston, MA 02113"239,4,"Went to brunch with friends .

It's a fine line of I feel bad bc I've been swamped and want to have sympathy , then there is where you almost feel bad asking for anything bc you feel like you are asking too much .

Just when you thought nothing can top Gong Cha opening down the street, they tack on an amazing Taiwanese snack/fast casual chain. And they learned from the other boba chains to up their quality of service. Â There's plenty of seating but don't expect to find many open spots on weekend evenings. From Cheers cut I recommend trying the basic ""ninja chicken nuggets"" which is popcorn chicken in the true Taiwanese fashion. Pick salt and pepper flavor & Taiwanese teriyaki sauce (given on the side) for taste test of the original classic style. Also would suggest a Taiwanese favorite, minced beef rice - decently cheap for a large bowl. I will be back soon to try more food offerings. And will definitely gather some folks to order the whole fried squid one day.",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"241,4,"Cheers Cut. I've wondered many times what the meaning of the name is. After countless sleepless nights and hours of vein popping focus, I've decided to give up. Yep, just like that. How does the newest fried chicken restaurant in town compare to the already crowded fried chicken competition? Restaurant Type: Fast Casual/Takeout. Â My short summary: Cheers Cut is what happens when KFC meets Jay Chou. Food (65%)  Taste to price 5/5 Quality to price 4/5 Portion to price 4.5/5 Average = 4.5Service (20%) Â  Friendliness 3.5/5 Promptness 3.5/5 Average = 3.5Cleanliness (15%)  Bathroom 3/5 Dining area 4/5 Kitchen area 4/5 Average = 3.67Overall Score = [F(.65)]+[S(.20)]+C(.15)] Â  Â = [2.93]+[0.7]+[0.55]  Â  Â = 4.18What else to know: To be fair, Cheers Cut is from Taiwan and all the other fried chicken restaurants (namely Bon Chon, BBQ Chicken, K-Town) are Korean so in a way, competition is slightly different. Right from the start when you walk in, it's a different feel as this place is more of a takeout/fast casual restaurant. You'll see the majority of customers holding a Gong Cha cup (which is for a whole 'nother review). When you look at the menu, there are many options for their chicken (and fried squid, which is a must try). You can either order their rice combos or just the meat as a snack. I went with the Samurai Chicken chili flavor with minced pork rice; it was simply delicious. For the price and portion, you cannot beat it. Easily, this place is for the budget conscious looking for something fast, relatively healthy, and a cup of Gong Cha for their friend. For these reasons, I call it the ideal spot for a first Tinder date. To all you serial daters, you can thank me later for that tip ;)**If you enjoyed my review, follow or add me as a friend. I have tons of reviews like this.",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"242,4,"For what it's worth, Cheers Cut is a decent addition to the Allston food scene by introducing Taiwanese fried chicken (popcorn and gigantic chicken cutlet, no less). The ninja chicken nuggets are their interpretation of Taiwanese fried chicken. True to form, they are crispy and provide a small amount of crunch upon biting into the chicken. The salt and pepper slightly edges out the chili as the chili flavor provides only a very small amount of burn while eating the chicken. Generally, you can do without condiments for the salt and pepper since it's already seasoned pretty well (Basil would prolly elevate this even further). If there's anything to avoid, french fries top the list. Usually, it's not something Asian restaurants do well in the first place and Cheers Cut is no exception. Not particularly crispy and slightly mushy, go with a more traditional appetizer. The decor inside the cafe is pretty cool with the art and dark lighting lending itself to a more ""cool"" and edgy vibe than your typical boba shop. Since the snack joint is sharing space with Gong Cha, you can also easily grab yourself some boba too. I will provide an updated review after trying the sauces and other menu items in the near future; overall, Â this is a pretty cool place to visit for a quick bite or after grabbing dinner in the area.

Also had the ninja chicken nuggets which i def reccommend !! Soo crispy and juice each chicken nugget !! 4.5 star for portion. I felt like the combo portion or the grill combo portion couldve been a little more. Or maybe thats just me. Haha very clean meal overall. Good for people on a diet. Gong cha is attached to this place. A very good boba tea place in my opinion.,Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"244,5,"Where can I find both Taiwanese fried chicken and good bubble tea from Gong Cha? Here!!!Cheers Cut shares its location with Gong Cha so you can order both at the same time (though they do have separate registers and you have to pay separately, the cashier manages both and you don't have to go to two different people).The menu isn't super extensive but instead, they offer what they do best: Taiwanese style fried foods like chicken fillets, tofu, and squid. They also have rice combos with these fried proteins or with grilled meat if you're feeling slightly healthier.I got the chicken fillet with minced meat rice and it was so good! The chicken comes with two sauce options and a flavor. I got the honey mustard x2 and asked for the chili flavor, which was a light sprinkle of chili powder on the chicken.I will be back soon to try the other menu items as well as the XL size fried chicken!!",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"245,4,"Great addition to Allston food scene...Quick bites, fried asian food, bubble tea, and quite well-priced. You know by description that this place will be a hit. And sure enough, if you come here on sundays, the line can go out the door. I came here a few times this week to check out a few of the menu items:Fried squid: great portion, can be shared with 2-3p, juicy tender squid fried in savory batter. Tried the salt and pepper, which tasted good. It came with tapioca crackers at the bottom, which is great in concept however was soggy and soaked in oil. Perhaps put the crackers on top next time?Giant chicken: tender meats with nice crunch into each bite. I would say this is also 2p portion with rice, unless you are a huge fan of chicken. I love the concept of eating this like a sandwich with the paper wrapper.Ninja chicken nuggets: pretty good bites, comparable to other taiwanese places like Dolphin Bay, try their thai spicy sauce with this.Oyster Mushrooms: one of my favorite dishes here and great alternative for vegans. Mushrooms were perfectly cooked with juicy mushroom flavors coming through each bite.Minced meat rice: if you are a pork fan get it, if you don't like eating tiny pieces of pork fats skip this altogether.Fishcake: tasted good, doesn't blow me away though. I am a HUGE fan of Gong Cha so the fact that they are in the same place has triggered my interest. The only downside is that the registers are separated for the two places which means a longer wait time in line.",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"246,4,"The long lines can be daunting, but their signature chicken and giant fried squid is worth trying! Appetizer portions are quite generous and I feel there's no need to get the combo (which includes a choice of rice/minced meat rice/curry rice/french fries and salad side.) If you want to get a little bit of everything, option A9 (Appetizer Combo) is a great choice as it has chicken, beef, and squid in a single serving.The place also has some seating although big groups might find a bit more challenging to be seated on weekends. My only two cents for this place would be to possibly split the lines for Cheers Cut and Gongcha (Bubble Tea vendor sharing the space with Cheers Cut) to speed up the ordering process. Overall, it's a great snacking joint that us Bostonians have been waiting for!",Cheers Cut,"154 Harvard Ave Boston, MA 02134"247,4,"I may or may not have been periodically checking in on the progress of this place from the day it was announced to when it opened, and I am so excited to have a place to hang out while I get my boba and snack fix. Gong Cha is by far my favorite Boston boba shop, so to have Cheers Cut join them in a cafe-style location is a dream come true. Admittedly, getting work done here is horrible for my waistline.I got the Minced Meat Rice (lu rou fan), which was fantastic. It was well flavored and tender. In my own experience making the dish, I've run into problems where it comes out too oily or salty (by virtue of all the soy sauce and pork belly), but both these issues were generally avoided here. Also, for $5, the dish was massive. The value!I also got an order of ""Ninja Chicken Nuggets"" otherwise known as Taiwanese popcorn chicken. Don't let the word ""nuggets"" fool you, these pieces of chicken are very much whole. It was well marinaded and practically popped in your mouth. The chicken was at that perfect just-cooked level, where there were no mushy undercooked parts, but none of the juiciness was lost either. I do wish it were a bit crispier, but the pros far outweighed the cons here.As an aside for service, the fact that it is a shared space makes ordering and pickup a bit confusing. The cashier for Cheers Cut and Gong Cha are the same, but with two registers, so if you want something from each place you get rung up twice. The pickup locations are also separate, so it's a bit confusing. My order got labeled as ""Pick Up"" instead of ""Dine In"" by mistake and my number never got called for the lu ro fan. It was a bit annoying, but hopefully these issues will be resolved once they get used to being open (and busy)!

The place in the Super 88 food court was decent (also from a Taiwanese chain), but since it closed, this is the closest thing I can find that would be most similar to the great fried chicken places in Taiwan. At least these are similar in size to the ginormous ones there. There are three flavors: salt and pepper, chilli, and plum. I've only tried the salt and pepper and will try the chilli which sprinkles chilli powder on to make it spicy. The staff will ask what sauce you want. I usually eat mine plain and have not needed any sauce to go with the chicken.

My lobster roll was a generous portion but I found the meat to be flavorless and wish they'd seasoned it a bit more.

Check it out.Listed in Drive Across America: yelp.com/collection/4_4-â€_",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"262,4,"Shared a cold lobster roll with my boyfriend. When we first got the lobster roll I thought it looks tiny especially for what we paid (~18 if I remember correctly). Buuuut after taking a bite into it, realized it was stuuuuuffed with fresh lobster. Even thought we shared one lobster roll, def thought it was enough lobster to satisfy my craving. If you dont want to spend so much, recommend sharing one and then sharing another one of their wraps, as theyre well priced and really filling!",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"263,4,Provided the kind of quality to be expected of Boston lobster at a fair price with quality service!Definitely would go back!,Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"264,4,"Excellent lobster roll. Not very big but what there was was packed.Pauli's in the North End gets packed at lunch time. With a few tables and a counter, it's very crowded. The folks behind the counter are doing a great job of managing the queue but it's clearly a busy place.Why so busy? The sandwiches are excellent. I saw an Italian go by that made me drool. But my taste buds were already promised to a lobster roll and it took about ten minutes to be prepared. It was worth being patient. Served on the usual hot dog bun, this was well loaded with big pieces of lobster meat and drawn butter. Big pieces and well stuffed. Yummy!Definitely will return to Pauli's for that Italian soon.",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"265,4,"Between 3 and 4 stars.Ordered the cold lobster roll with a bag of chip for $19 (basically lobster meat on a toasted hot dog bun) + clam chowder soup for $8 (the soup did not seem to be cooked at the restaurant, as I received it in a container with Saran Wrap melted).The restaurant had a very extensive list of choices on the menu from pasta, wraps, sandwich, salad, etc....",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"266,5,Stopped by on a Saturday around noon was was able to order with a pretty short wait. This place had an amazing lobster roll. We got one regular and one with the hot butter. I definitely recommend spending more for the one with hot butter because it really makes a big difference! The lobster roll had so much lobster in it that it was overflowing with each bite. The roll itself had the right amount of bread too.,Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"267,5,Hot lobster roll!

Â My first lobster roll in Boston; absolute winner!,Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"268,4,"Hot lobster roll was good. I thought it was in small size , just right for my hunger needs, but still an excellent fair value Â for 21 bucks and more butter or small butter portion on side would have made it better. The lobster meat as shown in picture was all top claw and knuckles meat.... no tough stringy lobster or chopped up meat by nibble pieces.A little ambiance upgrade will draw some of Neptune next door patrons as I had both Pauli's and Neptune's hot lobster rolls and prefer Pauli's . Neptune had too much roll and tough stringy nibble pieces like chef used my order to dump the lobster scraps. Menu on board was confusing. I may have tried a meatball or two if appetizer. A beer would have been nice...",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"269,5,"Classic Cold mayo lobster roll that comes with chips but you can upgrade to fries. The fries were fresh and hot when we got them- delicious! This place is awesome!!! You can what you want. Straight up lobster meat on a potato roll. The lobster is not overdressed and tastes fresh. We ate lobster rolls all over Boston but this is one of the best. Â No frills, fresh, Â delicious and completely reasonably priced. What more can you ask for??!",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"270,5,"Quick place to get lobster rolls in Little Italy! The lobster rolls were stuffed with lobster meat and the bread was so beautifully toasted. They come in two different ways, hot and buttered, and cold with mayonnaise. I personally would recommend the hot and buttered more as you get more of the lobster flavor, but mayonnaise is the more traditional way. Highly recommend and the cost was fairly low compared to most places without sacrificing quality!",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"271,5,Great lobster rolls. Walk up to the counter to order. When your food is ready and the call your number enjoy!,Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"272,5,"If you're wishing to splurge on lobster rolls, this is the place to visit! Both their hot and cold rolls are worth the indulgence. They aren't skimpy on the lobster claws stuffed inside each roll. I counted at least 3 whole claws in mine. The freshness is indisputable. I prefer the hot roll because the butter is melted and the taste of the lobster is more detectable than the cold. It just feels more hearty. It is also a few bucks more expensive. You get chips with each roll (just don't forget to grab them), and you can also order extra sides such as onion rings. We spent $44 total on two rolls and onion rings for lunch. Don't expect empty seating on the weekends, this place gets very packed. Get to go or come early. I'll be back to try their pastas soon!!",Pauli's,"65 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"273,5,Had a hot and cold Lobster roll. Both were amazing.

Please invest in your employees just a tad bit. They don't even care to recommend something other than the Loster Roll.

Try the fondue and the gnudi! This place is not good for groups, so this deliciousness is best kept as an intimate affair! What can I say about the fondue? The portobello was grilled to perfection and the fondue itself was flawless! My gnudi was delicious! It was a pretty filling plate that I would ORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN!Make your way here!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"276,4,"Yep, Grotto is located at or beneath street level at Bowdoin Street, which is not far from the Capitol Dome and the State House. It's fancy Italian which is really great for lunch. Oops.They have a nice lunch menu with set prices for one or two courses. Three of us at the table landed on the bolognaise for lunch, which was a delicious choice. It didn't look like much because it was served on a huge dish but the pasta already tossed with sauce turned out to be a very good portion. Rich, meaty, garlicky and delicious, I nabbed the last piece of bread from the basket to scoop up the little bit of sauce that was left. Delicious.It's not a very big restaurant - maybe a dozen tables of two- and four-tops - but they do a fine lunch and I'd bet, a better dinner.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"277,4,"Ready to finish this draft as a 5 but had a very non-Grotto experience this Friday. Table of 4 at 6 pm before U2. Expected from previous experiences to be out in an hour or so. App and wine came within minutes and then we waited over AN HOUR for main course in 1/2 full dining room! No communication about issues. The food came out and was tremendous as usual. But wow. Talk to us! Oh and it's the most over priced calamari (3 small pieces buried under greens) on the planet. Come on Grotto, you're better than that! Still a big fan. Will be back. You should go. Chalk it up to bad night.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"278,4,Really enjoyed our meal.There are a couple of not so good tables in the restaurant (to close to the kitchen runway) and unfortunately we got one of them.Other than that the evening and meal was great.,Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"279,5,"I. DON'T. CARE. HOW. LONG. THE. WAIT. IS! OMG this place is amazing! Prepare for a food coma!! Me and my partner searched for Italian places to go whilemany would suggest going to little Italy (North End) there is absolutely no need. Being a New Yorker I can certify that this place is of the highest regard. From the service to the food everything is spectacular! It is a nice ambient restaurant for that romantic getaway with your s/o or friend. We had the Gnocchi, Carne, fondue, duck and chocolate cake and it was superb. Zagat rated. But by far the best Italian spot I've seen in Boston. I hope to come back again in the near future!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"280,5,This is such a cute place tucked away in the heart of Boston. It is a bit underground and the interior is all brick - really romantic atmosphere. You have to get the black truffle garlic soup - it will set you free. The short rib gnocchi also to die for. I loved this place! One of my favorites in Boston and I will be back next time I'm in town!,Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"281,4,"This was our first time at Grotto and we would definitely go back. Warning, this place is very small and dark so would not be recommended for little kids. But it's a great date night spot.They participated in restaurant week and by far had the most choices for any restaurant week location I've been too.For appetizers we got mussels which came in a picatta sauce, and a toasted mozzarella caprese salad. Both were very good. The bread was average and was saved by the dipping oil.Very good wine and drink selection, especially for a place without a sit down bar. They offer two different sizes of wines by the glass, and half and full bottles.I had the chicken parm. This was by far the best chicken parm I've ever had. Great presentation that you don't see at most places. And the home made pasta and sauce was awesome. Chicken parm is usually a heavy dish. Â But not so here even though it was a very fair portion size. My girlfriend had the sea bass which was very good as well.For dessert we got the warm chocolate cake (my favorite) and the mixed berries. We were starting to get full but both were very good.We would definitely go back and would recommend Grotto to others. Quick/friendly service with great food. They could invest in a little more lighting while still keeping the intimate feel.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"282,4,"I came here for Restaurant Week last summer. I had the lobster Fra Diavolo as my main, and it was delicious. Spicy, but not too spicy. The Fraser was also great. Â The restaurant is very dark, and not well-light, as it is garden level.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"283,1,"Loved the location. Absolutely, adored the decor. Was very nice to have been 'subterranean'. Appetizer. Crab ravioli. My friend went with the beet salad. She seemed to enjoy it. The ravioli was nice, the shaved almonds were a great addition- Added some crunch Drinks. Initially my date ordered a glass of white wine and simultaneously It was overruled and I ordered a bottle of something red. Even still, the glass of white wine was brought to the table. Wait we asked for the bottle instead? And, they charged me for it. We did not drink it. Very odd Entree. This is where everything went sideways. Date ordered the haddock. Me, the gnocchi. Her haddock came out. And, a Bolognese for me. Wait... I ordered the gnocchi? The bolognese actually looked lovely, but has a three meat base, one of which is pork. Unfortunately, I don't eat pork. So. I let the waiter know. They took the dish back. Not really an apology and did not offer to keep my friends plate warm while we waited for them to fix the error. 20 minutes later. The gnocchi comes out. It was an unexciting dish. And my friends haddock was ice cold by this point. Somehow we were left without a clear apology. And, honestly I did not feel right to have paid for a dish that was sitting there for 20-25 minutes. Dessert. Again. They brought out TWO wrong desserts and we are left to re order A place like Grotto. You don't visit just for food and location. It is experience. That's why I ventured out to try it based on great recommendations. Maybe it was an off night. Maybe not. But, I did not enjoy the meal and to leave feeling like the restaurant owes me something, was a horrible feeling to have had. An apology. A make up for allowing my dates dish to age. Where, really offering to re make hers while they correct my order would be the expectation. After all, We came there to the eat together. The unexpected glass of white wine. The wrong desserts. All of these aren't HUGE blunders - other than the dish going cold. But, the way in which things were handled. Really was not right. Grotto. You have great potential- but the treatment of your customers needs to improve",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"284,4,"Intimate restaurant with Italian comfort food.I would've probably never found Grotto but someone gave me a gift card so my husband and I tried it out. I made a reservation for a Saturday night around 5:30pm. We came inside and there was only one other couple dining at the time. The music was at a perfect volume and despite the cold air outside, it was cozy at our small booth table. We chose the prix fixe menu for $35: an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I chose the carozza to start: a lightly breaded and seared piece of fresh buffalo mozzarella, wilted spinach, and a tomato sauce. The cheese was perfectly fresh and savory and the spinach cooked just the right amount.For the pasta, I got the gnocchi with short ribs. Man, oh man. This was the epitome of comfort food, ideal for a cold winter night. Then, to finish, I chose the panna cotta with lemon and raspberry. Overall, it was a delicious meal but nothing blew me away so I'll stick to four stars. The service was friendly and timely. This is a nice spot for a special occasion or quiet night out.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"285,5,"First off, my pictures do not do this place justice. Everything I ate was so incredibly delicious and flavorful that I couldn't put my fork down. Our waiter was very helpful and offered great recommendations. I opted for the $36 pick three option and it was perfect! Starter: steak fondue - GET THIS. It was sooooooo good. Tender steak, perfectly seasoned mushrooms, and some kind of heavenly cheesy sauce to dip. Entree: my husband and I both got the short rib gnocchi and pretty much licked our plates clean. The perfect choice on a cold December night. Dessert: bread pudding - such a unique spin! Served with pumpkin spice ice cream. This bread pudding was the best I've ever had.Perfect spot for a cozy romantic date night or dinner with a couple friends. A reservation is necessary due to this space being very intimate, only about 10 or so tables.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"286,4,"I came here with my three siblings, husband and brother-in-law for dine out boston. The best thing about eating with family? You can have a taste of what everyone ordered! Apps were all delicious. You seriously can't go wrong with any of the items we ordered, listed from most fave to fave - Â Fonduta (cheese fondue), Piccata (Mussels), Zafferano (Crab ravioli), Mare (Grilled calamari), Cavatelle (House prepared ricotta pasta). What really helps is the sauce, particularly from the cheese fondue, zafferano, and piccata dishes. We ordered more bread so we could dose it with sauce from those plates!Entrees weren't as impressive and the majority of the table ended up wishing we got ordered else. Â My husband loved the meatballs from his spaghetti and meatballs dish. My two sisters and i ordered the Gnocchi. We agreed that we would not order it again. Although the short ribs were tender, the gnocchi, which should be the star of the dish, tasted gummy and unseasoned. My brother and brother-in-law both ordered the grilled beef tenderloin and had mixed opinions, which stemmed from the grill of the meat. If you like medium/well done meat, then this is for you. If you're a medium rare lover like me, don't. Get dessert here. We were all a fan of the dessert that we got - Cioccolato (melting chocolate cake w/ vanilla ice cream), Budino (banana bread pudding w/ caramel ice cream), and Panna Cotta (Lemon w/ raspberry sauce)! I recommend going with the Budino or Cioccolato if you aren't very full, but if you are and just want something refreshing, get the Panna Cotta.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"287,4,"Grotto was sooooo good!The atmosphere was very intimate and set the mood, which is great for a romantic date, but if you go for anything else I'm not sure this is the right place. The staff was so friendly and very helpful in answering all of my questions and making great recommendations. I will say the amount of food you get for the price isn't quite on par with other restaurants in the area, so that was a little disappointing, but they do make everything from scratch so the flavor almost makes it worth the price. They also have a 'tasting' menu where you can get 3 courses (including dessert) for either $30 or $40, depending on your choices. If I go back, I'll definitely look into that option more because everything I tried this time (the cavatelli and short rib gnocchi) was delicious!Overall, I had a good experience at Grotto. It was a bit pricey, but if you need a restaurant for a special occasion I definitely recommend it!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"288,3,"Grotto is a small Italian restaurant, which is slightly dark with romantic vibes. The entrance of the restaurant is a little awkward with curtains and stairs. We came for Restaurant Week for dinner, which was $38 a person. With three courses each, I wasn't especially wowed. +BREAD & OLIVE OIL: Complimentary. The olive oil has a strong olive flavor, while the bread has a nicely salted crust. +BUDINO: Probably my favorite of the night, as the combination of the banana bread pudding and salted caramel ice cream is wonderfully delicious!-INSALATA: The combination of prosciutto, lemon, and parmesan is tasty, but honestly just what is expected. Perhaps more prosciutto would be nice as there was much more arugula.-PETTINI: Described as a scallop ""ravioli,"" but honestly wouldn't call it that at all. The ""ravioli"" was two sheets of pasta with a lot of arugula between in. The construction of it was honestly a little confusing. However, the scallops were well cooked with a nice sear on the outside. My boyfriend got the duck leg as the appetizer, which needed some salt but otherwise tasty. His entree was gnocchi with short ribs, but the gnocchi was disappointingly not fluffy. While parts of our meals were tasty, others were just okay, leaving something to be desired.All in all, the experience we had here was just okay. Perhaps it was just because it was Restaurant Week though. The restaurant was a little too dark, and the food was decent but left me a little doubtful with a normally $$$ price tag.",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"289,1,"We had a dinner in this restaurant. The good was just ok, the service very slow. Espresso was served almost cold and the tiramisu without any hint of coffee was served with a big big spoon which is too big to reach the bottom of the glass.

Can just guess how tidy this place.Never coming back!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"290,5,"I've been to Grotto 3 times now and it never fails to disappoint. It's a small, romantic restaurant that is a recently discovered hidden treasure. I've never eaten the pre-fix because I know I'll realistically not be able to finish it, but every entree I've eaten has been delicious. The ambiance is perfect and the servers are extremely well-mannered and polite. Did I mention the food? I usually don't love gnocchi but they made the second best I've ever had (second to a restaurant I've gone to.. in Italy). It melts in your mouth and has all the right combinations. The bolognese has all the right flavors too. I can't get enough of the Cioccolato dessert either, and I order it every time. Overall I HIGHLY recommend!",Grotto,"37 Bowdoin St Boston, MA 02114"291,4,"Grotto is super small and very dark- be prepared to use your phone to look at the menu. The ambiance was very nice but also a little loud because it's so small. I got the pumpkin risotto with mozzarella and pomegranate - it was AMAZING! The flavor was so rich and the sauce was so creamy. I absolutely loved it and there was so much that I took over half of it home. The spaghetti & meatballs were good too, the meatballs were huge!

Â The service is excellent once you're seated. Â It can take a while for one of the staff to see that you're waiting near the door, which is awkward for you and for those seated near the door. Â This is true even if you have a reservation; there's no way to check in without peeking through the curtains at the door. Â The food is good. Â Unfortunately, it's impossible to see anything. Â It's uncomfortably dark, even with the many tealight candles. Â The restaurant hasn't made any accommodations for being able to read the menu or being able to see your food. Â An appetizer with sausage had unexpected mushrooms; we couldn't see them listed on the menu and missed seeing them in the dish itself.

I had the shrimp plate and was delighted, my friends had various sandwiches (served with SOOOO much meat) and the crab cakes and there were no negative reviews. There is a pretty good amount of seating but you can expect to wait a bit in line if you go during lunch. The only thing that looked tastier than the options for lunch were those for breakfast and brunch so my sole disappointment really was the time of day I happened to show up. The only other downside is it's a lot to take in your first time, the menu is massive and that doesn't even include the daily specials so I am not even sure if I ate what I would have if the amount of people in tight quarters hadn't made me feel rushed.

Â I am giving 5 stars after one visit since it was such a fantastic experience. Located in the financial district, Fin Point is a high-end restaurant with a casual feel.

The location and restaurant are both great and the service, even better. Our server, Derek, was extremely attentive and overall great. We ordered the clam chowder, clam ceviche, fish dip, and mussels. The ceviche came out first and set the tone for the rest of the meal. It was tasteless and lacked lemon, a prime ingredient in a ceviche. The pineapple was a welcome taste but did not bud well with the obviously fresh clams. Maybe my opinion and understanding of a ceviche is different than what this restaurant had in mind, but we ended up returning the item. The rest of the good was good, enjoyable, but nothing out of this world. The best part was the clam chowder though it lacked spices - nothing a little black pepper can't fix. We decided against ordering a main dish and asked for our tab. Derek so kindly asked if we were in a hurry and we let him know we were not. He brought us out a delicious chocolate mousse dessert and won me over. He took care of the ceviche on the bill and went above and beyond to correct what was surely not his mistake. We made sure to let the restaurant manager what an incredible job Derek did and it did not go unnoticed. Unfortunately cannot give more than 3 stars as the food was not beyond average but Derek deserves all the stars.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"317,5,"This place is amazing. The atmosphere is high class, yet welcoming. The chef is a talent. I occasionally take risks with what I eat here, and the chef makes me truly enjoy foods I have never really been a fan of previously. I've sat everywhere in the restaurant, and all of the staff is amazing. In the lounge, our waitress was charismatic and welcoming - along with every server I've encountered in the dining area, and the bar. The owner, Meki, and manager, Peter, are very hands on and go above and beyond to please every customer. Whenever I go in I see them very involved in every customers experience. Fin Point, I will definitely see you soon!!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"318,5,"I had such a great time I feel the need to tell you about this place! We came with a large party (23) completely last minute. They have a private back room where they immediately set up 3 large tables for us. Service throughout the night was on point. But the food really knocks you out of the park! We had a plethora of appetizers. Hands down you must try the octopus. Its grilled to perfection. Completely reminded me of a nice steak while I was eating it and it was so good we ordered another one! We also tried the shrimp tacos, poke, razor clam crudo, baby back ribs, and bruschetta and prosciutto. They have us bread to hold us over for our entrees and even the bread was soft and baked to perfection. For entrees, I got the filet mignon. It's served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Flavor was great and all mixed well. My friends got the halibut and the tuna ahi steak which was also all very good. The tuna ahi is a thick cut! It was even bigger than my 8oz filet! At the end, we were served a dessert platter and ice cream! The entrees did take a little long to arrive, but our party was so last minute it was completely understandable. Ultimately the food was worth the wait. I'm definitely coming back here.. especially for that octopus!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"319,5,This place is in a very cute part of town and the service was excellent.

My husband said it was the best Bloody Mary he had ever had (it was so spicy)! Lobster Benedict is a must try and I loved the French toast and the waffle looked amazing. Quick note for families - We travel a lot with our 1 year old daughter and I am used to the scared or annoyed looks from waitstaff (babies rarely add to the tab and make a mess) - BUT this place not only accommodated our larger group with a private room, they smiled and talked to my daughter and made sure she was taken care of. From our sweet server, the manager, hostess and even one of the cleaning staff, they all spoke kind words and worked well together as a team.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"321,3,"Great location.

Great service, lovely atmosphere, terrific seafood.My dinnermate chose the clam chowder and said it was well packed with clams. I had the tuna tacos to start. Really well filled with spicy tuna and the corn shells were excellent. I ate every bite and even picked up the bits that fell out on the plate.For main course, we both chose the scallops. Not a huge portion with just three large scallops on a tasty risotto. Perfectly cooked, nicely plated. Very nice.Totally could return to Fin Point.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"325,5,"I came this morning for Easter brunch with my family and everything was so amazing!

Â I was so happy that we dined at Fin Point for my husband's birthday while in Boston. This restaurant is located in the Hilton. The ambiance is wonderful and they have a great bar area, too. Ellie was our server and we loved everything about her from her very attentive and caring service to her friendliness and smile to her knowledge about wine and the menu. Her recommendations were spot on. Ellie enhanced our dining experience. When I questioned the spiciness of the ceviche, she appeared at the table with a tasting. She went over and above normal service. We started with a great bottle of wine and the grilled octopus. The octopus was perfectly grilled with a nice roasted flavor. There was one large tentacle on the plate with micro greens, lemon roasted artichokes and wonderful aioli sauces. A perfect starter. My husband had the special fish for the evening which was the striped bass. He thoroughly enjoyed the dish. The fish was moist and flaky and the sauce made the dish. I had the daily ceviche and the beet salad. The ceviche was fresh and flavorful with poblanos and citrus. It was served with two large chips. The beet salad was phenomenal, the best I've ever had. It had yellow and red beets with goat cheese, baby greens, pecans and apricots with a sherry vinaigrette. We ended our meal with a cappuccino for me and a 20yr port for my hubby. Ellie surprised my husband with a chocolate mousse dessert with a candle for his birthday. Â It was so perfect! Â Ellie also took a few photos for us. We so enjoyed everything about Fin Point!

Â When our party arrived, we were seated with the best server. Â She was very knowledgeable and a great guide. Â She informed us of the specials and answered our questions. Â We could not stop commenting on how great she was. Â She even told us that she is a dancer with a focus on urban dance and hip hop. Â The fresh oysters were scrumptious. Â My linguini and clams were the best I have tasted. Â Everyone at our table was extremely impressed with the mussels, Â the lobster roll, the ceviche, and the tuna tacos.

I had the most relaxing afternoon having coffee at this beautiful place, I love the ambiance! Good place to sit and relax. I was debating between the chopped salad and the Tuna salad( both sounded very good), but my waitress recommended the tuna salad saying it was amazing and I was sold.And indeed it was something I had never tried anywhere else, the dressing was out of this world. After having a great lunch my server asked if I wanted to look at the dessert menu. I am not a big dessert person but my experience was already very good and I wanted to try something else. My server recommended the strawberry shortcake and she was right, one of the best desserts I've ever had. The cake was perfectly done and the chantilly cream was to die for!! I am definitely coming back to have some dinner and cocktails!",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"332,4,"we were wandering Boston when we saw $1 oysters from 12-4, which is honestly just what we were looking for. We each got a drink and a dozen oysters. They were fresh and delicious and presented well. The wait staff was really nice and the ambiance is lovely. The $1 oysters are on Saturday and sundays, and definitely worth a stop in you're wandering about that part of town.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"333,5,"Fin Point never disappoints. Â From the delicious food to the beautiful decor it is definitely a top notch restaurant. Â The new summer menu is amazingly delicious, especially the shrimp tacos.

Highly recommended for everyone and every occasion.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"334,5,"My husband said the eggs Benedict with lobster were quite tasty. I enjoyed a gluten free avocado toast with marinated shallots , paired with a Bloody Mary. The waitress made sure to check if the marinated shallots were safe for someone with Celiac disease. She stated that allergy concerns is one of the reasons they do not have a buffet option at this restaurant (it happens to be connected to a Hilton hotel). The eggs for both dishes were perfectly poached. We would visit again.",Fin Point,"89 Broad St Boston, MA 02110"335,5,"The Barking Crab is located right on the water. The place has much personality and most importantly it has some great tasting food. When I went to wash my hands I noticed that the sign on the men's restroom has a sign of the artist formerly known as Prince. Oh yes so cool. We ordered the basics and it was delicious. Parking can be really tough in the area so consider a car service. I spent $24.00 dollars for an hour at a lot nearby with a maximum of 54.00 so be careful where you park. I would reclined eating here, it was delicious",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"336,3,"Ambiance: 5 stars! Super fun, live band, right on the water. BUT - outside is super loud. This is expected with the live band, so be expected to literally yell at your table to hear one another. Service: 1.5 stars. Super huge mess. There is no communication between outside and inside, so our 45 minute wait turned into a 1.5 hour wait because both outside and inside thought the other had a table for us. Very confused staff. Once we were seated, our waitress was pretty disinterested in general. Food: 4 stars. Amazing seafood as expected! Everyone enjoyed their food. I got the salad (gluten free!) and it was super pricey for a pretty basic salad. Next time I will go with a entree for the same price! Still good, though.

The waiting lists, as I learned, are completely separate. As far as I know, they have the same menu.We opted not to wait for the outside seating and instead enjoyed a table at the inside dining room with a window overlooking the seaport area and a small marina. Close enough, right?Starting off with an appetizer of peel and eat shrimp, they were cooked perfectly with onions and green peppers, served with a sharp cocktail sauce and a wedge of lemon. My only problem was that it would have been awesome if they had deveined the shrimp as some of them had recently eaten well, if you know what I mean.For mains, a fried fish sandwich was a good portion with excellent fries, cole slaw and a pickle. Delicious and nicely cooked. And then, a ""fire-grilled lobster"" was a very good portion, cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Plenty of meat in this bugger and not hard to eat as the appropriate utensils and a plastic bib were provided.Service was friendly and efficient. No problems at all.Barking Crab isn't fancy and it's not really a date place.

Now this is a very popular spot in Boston Harbor where they dump the tea but I really enjoy the ambiance versus the quality and portion of the seafood. The seafood is good since I had the lobster roll and the fried clams but considering I've eaten other seafood places, I have had I better experience elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, the food was tasty but just living in New England, I've just had a bigger and fresher portion of seafood up the seacoast we're at Sea to table.The place is fun and the service was very nice with this one. Wonderful server called Felipe. The only thing I don't like about this place was that there was tartar sauce on the floor that they forgot to clean up so I end up stepping on it when I was seated. I was trying to figure out what was slippery under my shoe sole as I got up.",Barking Crab,"88 Sleeper St Boston, MA 02210"340,3,"This place has been around for such a long time and has a fun, kinda kitschy vibe to it. Right on the water, there are lobster traps with strings of lights wound around them on the ceiling. Food was pretty good. We shared the fried clams and chowder as apps. Both were good. The fried clams stayed crisp and the chowder had great flavor and perfect thickness to it. I shared the sesame ahi tuna and the baked lobster roll with my friend. The tuna came with rice and seaweed salad and rice and was pretty tasty. The lobster was pretty dry and didn't have much butter on it. The coleslaw it came with was too sweet but the fries were perfectly crispy. It was annoying to get a table. There are two entrances/hostesses depending on where you want to sit. We weren't super particular on where to sit, we just wanted a table but they kept sending us back and forth and each time we went to the other side the other hostess was nowhere to be found.

Yes its a tourist trap and you can get the same food a lot cheaper some place else but its still a fun time. The food is very good and definitely up to par with other seafood places in the area.

It's the ultimate New England restaurant you should experience at least once in your life, but not for the quality of the food...it's for the atmosphere. Some things you should know:1. It's right on the water so it's a great view 2. Great patio & outdoor-ish restaurant with appropriate nautical decor3. Friendly service4. Loud & always crowded5. The waitstaff is almost always more ethnically diverse than the patrons6. Make reservations if you have a big group7. Not vegetarian friendly unless you wanna eat sides or salads8. Lots of tourists9. Drinks are pricey & not very strong but tasty. 10. Seafood is fresh, pricey, & somewhere between mediocre & Whole Foods take-out in terms of tasteYou come here for the really fun atmosphere.

Yes, their clam chowder was delicious but so are a lot of other places. Their lobster roll was also good but charging $28 for it was criminal. It didn't stand out as any more amazing than any of the other places we tried other than it's enormous price tag. The Barking Crab is a tourist trap. We were tourists and got trapped but still enjoyed our food and had a good time. It's basically a shellfish party in a large circus tent. Prepare to come early or expect a long wait.

This is super reminiscent of one of my favorite restaurants in Siesta Key, FL. The wait staff is quick- we got our drinks super fast (I loved my spiked blueberry lemonade and my friend had the pomegranate martini). These drinks are SUPER SUPER strong. We had the lobster empanadas which were surprisingly amazing! there is a good amount of lobster and the spicy aioli is great. We also got the fish tacos (haddock is what was in that day), which I liked. It was lightly battered with a good amount of lettuce and salsa on the side.

Ordered a bevy of dishes including oysters to start (pretty fresh) and clam chowder (one of the few things worth eating) and drinks (avoid any cocktails on the list as they are weak and not well made).Entrees included the crab cake combo and the seafood casserole. Crab cake combo was shockingly tiny with three tiny, overcooked and over salted shrimps and a bed of lettuce soaked in dressing. Seafood casserole was salty and mostly breadcrumbs with very few pieces of seafood. The one redeeming factor was that the service was fantastic. The waiter we had was very nice, attentive, and friendly. Overall - maybe worth visiting once for lunch if it's your first time but wouldn't stray any further into the menu beyond the clam chowder.

We had about a 45 minute wait but with the aquarium right there and the harbor we enjoyed walking around and seeing the sights while we waited. Our waiter was very helpful in helping us pair wines with all our entrees, I had an oak aged Chardonnay and it was wonderful.I had the lobster roll because of my aforementioned obsession with seafood, and it is nothing to mess with. I had it hot with drawn butter and my mouth was WATERING at the sight of it. Stuffed with succulent fresh lobster on a warm quishy bun of perfection, this lobster roll was very possibly the most satisfying bite of food I've ever taken. The roll goes at market price but I thought it was reasonable for how full of lobster it was. They do not skimp!One of our group members is gluten free dairy free and they were very accommodating of that, they even had gluten free rolls for her and were very careful to keep everything separated. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had to wait a pretty long time for a waiter to come to our table, to take our order, for our food and then our checks. It was busy but it seems like they should be used to that because of its prime location and great reviews.",Legal Sea Foods,"255 State St Boston, MA 02109"364,5,"I ordered the lobster roll with mayo- delicious- because it wasn't smothered with mayo...kids menu had a ""small""Lobster... fun...

As far as the Sangria goes the liberty one (or at least that's what I think it's called) was very good but the strawberry sangria was a bit too sweet and tasted like medicine. As our main course we both ordered the shrimp pasta and that didn't disappoint. It was flavorful and they didn't skimp on the shrimp.

The menu was very well laid out, and the atmosphere a bit upscale beach-bar like. We ordered right away, and our food was brought to us very quickly. We ordered a bowl of Clam Chowder, the Bang Bang Cauliflower, and a Lobster Roll. The Bang Bang Cauliflower was pretty good, my only complaint would be that the Cauliflower was just a bit over-sauced. Other than that I would recommend it!The Clam Chowder was AMAZING. It was creamy, yet light. The pieces of clam in the Chowder were big chunks and they were so fresh they basically melted in your mouth! The Lobster Roll was also fantastic! I never really liked the lobster I had tried before, but I decided to give it another shot. The lobster was also so fresh and buttery. It was so delicious! I cannot wait to come back here.

I ordered the crab cakes which were absolutely amazing. I will be craving them for some time. My husband got the combo that included crab cakes, scallops and shrimp.

Any time you are in the Boston area you have to visit Legal seafood. This review is for the one across from the new England aquarium.

Living in florida now, there's nothing better than lobster ftom new England! Also had plenty of options on the kids menu, my kids had a cheeseburger and a little pizza. The clam chowder was nice and thick with excellent flavor and more than enough clam and veggies in the soup. The lobster roll was so buttery with plenty of lobster pieces. We had the Boston Cream pie for dessert which was presented differently in a round small cake but oh my goodness.

Count me in!I usually reserve my poutine eating habits when I'm in Canada, however to my surprise when finding lunch places along the the Freedom Trail, this place popped up in my radar. Poutine is one of those winter time comfort dishes because it just warms the soul with its crispy, cheesy, gravy goodness. But it's the hottest summer ever. But I'm also in town and I love poutine. Love for poutine over 86 degree humid weather. I just saw more pros than cons in Saus. I ordered the regular sized poutine with classic gravy and topped off with pork belly and crispy shallots. My brother ordered the kimchi fried chicken but as a salad. We even ordered an extra side of the fries to try out their cheddar-ale Saus and their bacon-parm Saus. So good, all of it. The classic sauce isn't too salty that it overpowers the entire dish. The topping options are also spot on to help you customize and balance out your dish. Overall amazing experience.

Â Very similar to Pomme Frites in NYC. Â Their potatoes are hand cut in house, and I confirmed this with my best friend who worked there one summer. Â She cut loads. Â Eat your fries gratefully!SAUCES ($0.75)My favorites are the mayos: **Roasted Garlic** and **Secret Saus** (both $0.75).

Â #1 is still Mayos though.SANDWICHES / MEATS IN CARBS ($9)I'd recommend the **Crispy Chicken** or **Pork Carnitas** (both $9). Â They're not life-changing like some of the chicken or carnitas sandwiches I've had in NYC, but they are decently yummy!I didn't like the kimchi in the Kimchi Fried Chicken. It wasn't strong or fermented enough like normal kimchi, but more like a kimchi slaw. Â Idk if this is to make it more palatable to, errr, people who are used to more ~neutral palates~, ahem.I've also tried the Frik too, but didn't realize it would be so thin (this is the standard for Friks FYI). Â If you're looking for value / a filling meal, I'd recommend the sandwich over it especially since both are $9. Â 'Twas not enough for my tall and hungry boyfriend.SWEETSTheir **Liege Waffle + Salted Caramel** ($3 + $0.75) is sooo good. Â It has a nice chew with every bite, albeit it's very small size -- like half a small waffle.

We found this spot that focuses on fries. Not just any fries, Belgian style fries! The inside is not big but not too small. They had a large table at the entrance, can be used for a big group, or as a communal table. The rest of the space has seating with smaller table on the left side of the wall. At the back is their kitchen and ordering counter. You need to order your food at the counter, pay for them, and then take your seat. Go back and pick up your food when your name is called.We got Hand Cut Fries. They do have all sorts of poutine and other fancy kinds, but we want to try the very basic one, as we heart it is the best way to get the true flavor. We got two kinds of sauce to go with it, Secret Saus and Truffle Ketchup. We also spotted complimentary Housemade Hot Saus, so we got that as well. They offer 15 plus unique sauces! They were really good and tasty, went perfectly with the fries.The ""Regular"" sized fries were pretty big, enough to share! Potatoes were fried perfectly, crunchy exterior and soft and potato-y inside. Definitely reminded me of the real Belgian fries that I had in Belgium. Staffs were courteous and nice, efficient and quick. The fries are made to order so they are fresh and hot!

Â But I ended up preferring the Crispy Chicken Sandwich $8.50 (beer brined chicken breast and scallion slaw and dill pickles and Saus mayo on a central bakery bun) over the Veggie Burger $8.50 (farro, fava beans, corn, kale patty and dill pickles and scallion slaw and sliced tomato and cheddar and swapped for the avo-goddess sauce on a central bakery bun) because the flavors weren't as strong and the patty gave me no resistance such as a meat based burger might.",Saus,"33 Union St Boston, MA 02108"381,4,"We came here after a night of drinking and their fries are such amazing drunk food!

Now, I have a talent for putting away food (and the body to prove it), but I had to struggle to fit the whole thing in my stomach. The struggle was well worth it though. The fries were salty but delicious, and the gravy and cheese curds paired very well together. For the fries that weren't drenched in gravy, I tried their house-made ketchup, which was phenomenal! It was perfectly balanced, and I swear I tasted a hint of maple.

I chose the crispy chicken sandwich, which was excellent. A thick chicken breast, covered in batter and fried up nicely, served on a bun with cabbage and pickles. Yummy and very hot.With it, I ordered a ""regular"" size of fries. Hand cut and a little random, which is nice. Some done light, some done a bit more. Tasty with the salt.

But the staff was very friendly and patient with my indecisiveness at their extensive sauce menu. We got the poutine with kimchi. The poutine itself was okay, the gravy just didn't do it for me. The kimchi didn't really add much to the poutine either.

The fries were perfectly cooked. The sauces and cheese curds are delicious. My only complaint was there isnt enough fresh opinions. The poutine is a heavy and greasy dish. Im not a fan of vegetables and like greasy food. But sometimes too much grease isnt a good thing. I ordered the scallions and crispy schallots to lighten the dish. Turn out crispy shallots is fried shallots. The whole dish was way too greasy. Also the pork belly is super delicious on its own but way too heavy for this also.

The place was recommend to me by a friend who knows I love history and after telling me that this is the oldest continuous running restaurant in the entire USA how could I not go. Also I thought; of its good enough for John F Kennedy , it's good enough for me. The outside is beautiful and it's in a really cute part of town. So a star for that.

The beer had a fishy taste, I suspect it was the cup, which is understandable. On our way to wash our hands we noticed more cool memorabilia on the walls which was cool to look at and take photos. There was something about the hair and filthy Â bathroom that made me rethink my purchase of clam chowder (the only thing available after 10:00p) I mean was someone getting manscaped in there? There was no soap in the dispenser or it wasn't working. Â While I chatted with my buddy waiting on the chowder he commented to me how dusty the bar looked, the bottles were dusty and the touch screen on the register was greasy looking, it was dirty. Suddenly I started to notice that the entire place needed some TLC and some cleaning, it wasn't patina there were crumbs and other unidentifiable particles. Perhaps this is the restaurants charm? It's not for me. I think the outside of the building is beautiful and the history of the place makes it a good place for pictures and something on the bucket list, but I don't think I could recommend dining here.

Don't sit in the back of the second floor; it's so small that all the conversations make the atmosphere very loud. We had to move because we couldn't hear ourselves.The waitress (she didn't say her name) forgot my guest's baked beans, and they rarely came by our table unless we called them over. When she refilled my tea, she stuck her finger in the glass as she held it. From watching the other waiters, we realized it was just our waiter, so you'll most likely get good service here.Don't order the American Bouillabaisse! The cod wasn't deboned, the broth was red water, and they mix in steamers, which are known for being sandy, plus they gave the broth a bad aftertaste. The mussels were cooked well, but the scallops were a bit rubbery (scallops are difficult to cook, so I expected it anyways), and the lobster was not cut well in half. There were pieces of inner shell mixed with the lobster meat, and there was a small amount of body/tail meat left inside, as if some had been scooped out. Neither me or my guest found any of the lobster meat in the soup. The lobster meat was boiled well, though, and it was very tender.The price of the food was a major issue. Since almost all of the food included lobster, the given price was almost always ""market price."" Since our waitress was absent, we couldn't ask what the price was for today. As a recommendation, there should be some kind of average price range, or even a base price plus the market price ($17.99+market price, for example).Overall, I did not enjoy my time at the restaurant.

Yes I felt like a tourist in a trap but I couldn't resist it. The narrow entry can be difficult to pass through with people coming and going. Once inside there is a gift shop to the left and raw bar seating to the right. We were seated promptly and our server was polite and attentive. Bread service was a hunk of corn bread with a wrapped square of butter underneath. It alone could be a meal. I didn't want to spoil my appetite so I didn't bother to eat it. I should have. Hubby ordered steamers to start. Our server showed him how to pinch the skin away, bath it in water to remove grit and dunk it in the butter. After watching, I'll admit that I got a bit nauseous. Hubby dove right in and loved them. I looked away. Not my thing. Hubby had lobster for his main. The presentation was dramatic and a little macabre. The lobsters face was placed in front of the butter as if it were drinking. Twist of the tail and let the cracking begin. I've had lobster loads of times but I just couldn't eat it this time around. Hubby, butter splatters on his shirt and happily munching away, was not put off by the little butter slurping face at all. I'm not usually squeamish but this day, I was. I ordered 1/2 dozen oysters. They were fairly small and only partially detached. I wasn't given an oyster fork so I had to use a regular one to detach them. Some were gritty. The cocktail sauce tasted like ketchup even after I added horseradish. It had a sweetness to it that was unappealing. Hubby for the win. He enjoyed his meal, hence the three stars.

Additionally, it is located right next to The Bell in Hand Tavern (Est. 1795) which is the oldest continuously operating tavern in the United States. So you really can get a two for one!The clam chowder at The Union Oyster House is delicious. Super thick and creamy with delicious clam flavor.Let's be honest though, you aren't eating here because of the food. You are coming here because of the history.

Sam Adams slams down his pint, lets kick some ass!!Walking in, it's an old school vibe. There is a very small bar, and a small area for dining. The larger dining room is upstairs. Since I'm little ol me, I'm going drink a pint and nom on some chowder. My waitress comes over and explains Sam Adams makes a special beer for this restaurant. I place the order for beer, New England Clam Chowder and some grilled oysters. My beer and chowder comes first. Man... the chowder is crazy good! Made with huge chunks of fresh clams, add the special beer to the party? Heaven. Next my grilled oysters come to me. The grilled oysters was another perfectly executed dish. I know this place is a tourist magnet. The chefs at Union Oyster House did not skimp on quality when prepping these dishes. My oysters had a unique taste and were not overcooked. Everything about my experience was top notch at the Union Oyster House. If you're in the area, its a must stop to drink a unique beer and enjoy the regional dishes.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"402,3,"Given its name is Oyster House, then the rating is just average. Â I've had better oysters in Island Creek. Â Lobster on the other hand, tasted better than Legal Seafoods. Â It tasted sweeter while Legal just tasted salty like from sea water, so take your pick. Â Legal's clam chowder is better imho though as it's too thick for me for the Union's. Â Good service, lots of seating and interesting inside.

Old world neighborhood town bar with contraceptions and memorabilia from the good times. Freshest Oysters I have ever eaten. Tip - there was over a one hour wait at 4:30pm on a Sunday, luckily my gf and I got seated at the bar waiting less then ten minutes and it was well worth it, one of the highlights of the trip.The two bartenders / master shuckers open close to 3k oysters on a given day and shuck for the entire restaurant! They use an old contraception after shucking the Oysters to bring it to the upstairs shown in one of the below pics! You just have to love the old school ambiance!

It's always busy during the weekends so we got in easily during a Thursday lunch.The prices are really high for the quality and quantity of food they provided. We ordered a seafood plate that was not worth ~$26.Alas the service was not great. You would think that a place that calls to tourists would be very welcoming but they were not. We both felt very rush and the bartender even threw a spoon at us for our soup.

Â I had the scrod and was admittedly disappointed with lack of seasoning for my own taste - but the fish was still cooked to perfection.They do not have Coke or Pepsi products - they have what I believe is a local cola (it was okay)My favorite thing here that we tried was their clam chowder, but the cornbread is damn good too!",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"407,5,Such a great doing experience!This is the oldest restaurant in the US and I can see why they have stuck around!The service was fantastic!

They were also really nice about the fact that we had a baby and played peek a boo with her.The good was delightful! The clam chowder was the best I've ever had!

It's a tourist trap - we just wanted to try it out since it's the oldest restaurant. It's an interesting place in terms of its history, but other than that, it's not worth it. We had 2 Bloody Marys and 2 meals and the bill was $75. Rediculous. Our server was very brash and would just throw the plates on the table in front of us. It took her forever to even come and take our drink order when we first sat down. If you want to come here and check out the restaurant's history, I would sit at the bar and just order a drink. Food is so much better in other places in Boston.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"411,3,"The historical significance of the Union Oyster House is a big draw. I mean how many times do you get the chance to eat at the oldest restaurant in the United States and where historic figures like Daniel Webster ate? It was a neat experience from that perspective but it comes with a hefty price tag and I can't say the food was particularly stellar. We got oysters which were fine but the house made cocktail sauce had a weird funk that reminded me of the way my grandmother's house smelled. The cornbread was cold and pretty sweet which is not to my liking. The service was very good and they do have a beer brewed just for them by Sam Adams which was very good. On the whole, I'm glad we went but I wouldn't go back.",Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"412,2,Over priced tourist trap. We waited over an hour for a table.

Don't bother going in to eat!,Union Oyster House,"41 Union St Boston, MA 02108"413,4,"Self proclaimed the oldest continuously running restaurant in America, this place definitely has character. You can hang out downstairs for the lightened menu or go upstairs for the chicken fingers. I mean don't, but if you must, they do have it. The oyster bar downstairs is part of the original bar. In fact, coasters serve double duty as balance adjusters so your plate doesn't slide right off. The two shuckers are super friendly and gel well together. Funny enough, I actually witnessed their dumb waiter breaking off the chain. Luckily no one was hurt. I started with the Sam Adams Colonial Ale. If you've never heard of it before, it's because they only serve it at this place. I don't traditionally like Sam Adams but this was quite tasty. I went with a cup of New England clam chowder (the white one) and some steamers.

Â Food: The appetizers were outstanding. Â We had perhaps the best clams casino I've ever had. Â The calamari was good - not the best we had in Boston (hello Legal Seafood) - but still very satisfactory. Â My clam chowder was delicious.

I'll start with 3 positives. 1) They sell a bottled cane cola that is fantastic. 2) they were open. 3) I could charge my iPhone. That's it. Overpriced. Underwhelming. Bland food. Burger was seriously underwhelming. Average at best. Soggy roll. Overwhelming amount of toppings that had no magic. (I ordered the man cave).They managed to check off every one of my big pet peeves. - only one size of fries. This would be forgivable if the fries were creatively prepared. Â They were not. Just typical fast food frozen bland fries unworthy of $4. - don't make me predict your service. I hate when takeout places make you tip at ordering. Â How am I to know how you will do? A tip is what I reward you with for great service. And the default lowest amount was 15%. Service was mediocre and they were out of things. - if you're a restaurant, have a restroom. Duh. After walking around Boston chances are you want to wash your hands before eating handheld goods like a burger and fries. Just a big letdown. Doesn't happen often. Took an Uber from south station since the reviews and photos were so enticing. At least I could charge my phone. But I probably used that juice to write this crummy review. $20 for a basic fast food burger, fries and soda? Nah.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"418,3,"I got the man cave burger because everyone on yelp was raving about it but to be honest, it wasn't THAT good. I'd give it like a 6/10.

There's nothing fancy about this joint and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's small, it has a few stools around the counters along the walls and they have a tiny kitchen that you can see into. Not a lot.My colleague and I ordered burgers. I chose the pimento cheese which came with a big pile of crispy bacon and thin-sliced pickles. A double beef patty, it was super juicy and very delicious. A little messy but awesome.We shared a basket of fries, which apparently only come in the size of ""massive"" because there were still leftovers after two growing boys dug into them.They do have a wifi but we didn't spend enough time here to sign on.

The Wheelhouse was okay (didn't like the sauce too much), but I enjoyed the man cave.

Overall, great little place to grab a quick bite to eat!",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"422,5,"Initially i was worried that this place is overhyped but it wasn't! We got Mancave, Fun Guy and Cali. I cannot pick which was my favorite burger because they were EQUALLY AMAZING! I wouldn't recommend getting an extra patty because each burger is perfectly balanced with the amount of sauce and cheese. Throwing in another patty would ruin the proportion (in my opinion). I'm definitely coming back again... !! Tips: order online! The only minus point is the wait but you can order online to skip the wait",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"423,4,"These guys make a pretty tasty burger. Â The quality is definitely there, but not the old condiments like lettuce and tomato. The first time I came here, I was caught up in the hype and a little bit disappointed.

Didn't feel too full or hungry with a side of fries. The Chuck Norris is pretty good, and filled with flavor. It gets busy at lunch, Â so you should order online or be very patient.One thing I applaud them for is wrapping everything in wax paper.

I loved the buns with the creole sauce. There wasn't an overwhelming amount, thank god. Cheese was my favorite part because they give you a massive amount but not too much to the point where it overpowers the other flavors.",Wheelhouse,"63 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"429,3,"We stopped in for breakfast sandwiches.

The line wasn't too bad on the 4th of July. We highly recommend Maine Lobster Roll. But Boston Chowda was a so-so. Street parking was totally impossible.

There are two main queues inside the tightly packed market. Hordes of tourists crowded at the registers not sure what to order. The owner was pushy and belligerent in his acknowledgement of each customer and practically shouting at you to get the pre-set special of lobster roll, chowder bread bowl and drink. We managed to get through the queue and quickly ordered our hot lobster roll and small bowl of chowder, no bread bowl. Our to-go food arrived quickly and we ate outside in the public seating area. Immediately upon picking up the roll I noticed the sitting seafood smell and also realized my hot roll was not hot at all. Rather the roll was toasted and got cold and the lobster was room temperature and rubbery. The chowder saved the meal though not very much clams in the thin soup base. Flavor profile of chowder was all there, not much to chew on except a stray piece of clam and copious potatoes. Added the oyster crackers in the end for some semblance of texture. All in all, the rolls here were the least memorable during our time here in Boston. I'd recommend you venture away from Quincy Market for a hot roll elsewhere, such as Neptune's up the way - theirs was fresh, juicy and hot!",Boston Chowda,"1 Faneuil Hall Market Pl Boston, MA 02109"437,4,"WHAT TO TRY???The lobster roll. The Boston chowder. This place is located inside Faneuil hall. There's always a line here so if you see a line, you're mostly at the right place. They're known for their lobster roll. I like their roll because it's served hot in butter. The bun was crispy on the outside. The clam chowder was alright though. Nothing that special but if it's your first time in boston, make sure you try the chowder. The lobster roll can come as a combo that comes with a small chowder and a soft drink. Quite a deal if you take advantage of it for a nice lunch. LAST TIP?!You can also have the clam chowder served in a sourbread bowl if you haven't tried it already. I normally can't finish the bread bowl though, but you can definitely feed the birds with the left over bread if you like. I usually just get the regular chowder without the bread though.",Boston Chowda,"1 Faneuil Hall Market Pl Boston, MA 02109"438,4,"Boston Chowda is the number one stop inside Quincy Market. Almost everyone comes here with two expectations - clam chowder and lobster roll.

In addition they got other soup options like Rockport Lobster Bisque, Paul Revere Chili, Plymouth Corn Chowder, Manhattan Clam Chowder, and Mother's Chicken Vegetable Soup. ***New England Clam Chowder (small cup, $4.99): Creamy soup with a good oyster-to-potato ratio.

It can be a bit of a wait depending on how busy it is, but the staff is quick and efficient.The New England Clam Chowder is famous for good reason. Deliciously creamy with a good amount of clams and potatoes - my only regret was not getting it in the bread bowl! It was probably the best chowder I've ever had.

If you're someone who likes simplicity, you may be a fan but I found it a bit bland for my liking as there wasn't much else going on other than bread and lobster.The perks of this place are food is piping hot, they have delicious chowder, and they don't skimp out on their portions.

Food court style service in a very long hall of options. Cold day, so I thought some Chowda would hit the spot. It was warm but nothing special. I've had canned that was just as good. The lobster roll was a total let down. Hot dogish style bun, tasteless lobster and what's with the lettuce under it? Small portion of lobster and priced at just under $22.

A cool little place for a quick bite to eat.

Besides being homey and a little snug inside, there are community tables right outside the building under the plastic cover. Around this time it's a bit chilly to sit out there but good news my friends, they'll warm these pies up for you if you plan to eat here. And the pies? I think we went here when they had an off day. Buffalo Chicken Mac N' Cheese Pie (Monthly Specials)- Didn't have that tang or kick from the buffalo sauce. It had an odd cheesy texture and was lacking flavor. The crust was the highlight of this pie, flaky goodness.Beef Stew Pie- We were looking forward to this in particular but surprisingly the meat tasted like it had no seasoning. Not sure if it was sitting under the lamp too long but everything basically evaporated and was completely dried out.Potato Wedges- The one item on the menu that didn't disappoint. Extra crispy potatoes with sweet and spicy chili sauce drizzled all over. Overall Service: It was stale.

I had ordered a pie but the buzzer never buzzed. I went in and asked if it was ready and the owner brought the pie out of the back. I felt the top and it wasn't hot so I said something. The owner assured me it was hot and I was like ""I just felt it - it doesn't feel hot"". He took the pie, turned it upside down and slammed it on the counter. The pieces flew everywhere, all over me. I was so shocked I cried. I kept repeating ""it didnt feel hot!"" I called my husband over and showed him my jacket, and he went to the owner and was like ""are you serious??"" The owner said ""whatever! I showed her it was hot and she got hysterical.""I had brought 12 people with me - all my neighbors in East Boston and they had to see me cry in front of KO Pies manager.

As many others, we were in town to visit the cider house next door. We came here based on the many Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. At first it looked a bit overwhelming, but it's quite a fine-tuned machine. You order at the counter. There are signs everywhere telling you where things are and where you can find things. It's really helpful. We ordered the classic meat pie and the special of the month, which was Buffalo Chicken Mac 'n Cheese. We were not disappointed. I must say, I wish we jazzed up our order a bit based on what was coming out of the kitchen. We kept it pretty basic. The pies were already made and waiting for us in a hot space, bonus! We didn't have to wait for the meal to be ready. I wish we ordered the potato wedges! Both pies were really delicious. Our meal of two pies cost $15. I don't think you can beat that. In hindsight, we should have vamped up our order. The pies are relatively small, so they weren't that filling. You can sit (season pending) at their picnic tables under the awning. They also have a pretty sweet outdoor area that offers some backyard games and seating. This is really cool place that you don't get to experience often.

The owner, however, is an extremely sensitive, tiny-statured, and generally, delicate individual who, if you're unfortunate enough to encounter, may throw an epic tantrum over the slightest perception of offense. Oddly enough, he seems to exhibit some self-control over his case of the angries. He limits his ""threatening"" *snorts* behavior towards mainly his women customers and small children.

There were pies that had some type of sauce on top but I Â apparently got one that did not and I think that made a difference. The pie tasted a bit dry.Cost: The pie was about the size of a palm. On the expensive side for how much you are getting. Worth an experience if you never had one of these before.Environment: Cozy would be a word I would use to describe the place. Getting your order in is a bit difficult because space was small but the eating area is nice and open with a couple picnic table styles to sit on.Service: There wasn't much service except putting your order in. Depending on what you ordered, it looked like the pies were made and kept in a warmer and as soon as you ordered they would take it out and give it to you.Uniqueness: I would consider this experience unique because I've never had anything like this before. Something I would recommend to try at least once.Came to visit the cider house next door.

This place is seriously in the middle of a shipyard and there isn't much near by except for Downeast which is a cider brewery. Had the classic beef pie and a can of cider. Both were amazing! Even went next door to Downeast to get a six pack of ciders to take home. The only reason they aren't getting five stars is because of the location.

Our last stop was Down East Cider which is literally feet from KO Pies so we decided to have some Australian in Boston (said no one ever). The place was really busy and not just from the Down East crowd, KO seems to have a local reputation for good quality inexpensive food. We decided to each get a meat pie with a couple dishes to share. They were out of the seafood pie my girlfriend wanted but she settled on a classic beef and cheese (think cheeseburger). I had the Jamaican jerk chicken with pineapple sauce which was OK but there was so much crust and it needed moisture from hot sauce and the side pineapple sauce to help me get it down. The shared dishes we got were their famous fries, served with two dipping sauces and the spicy wings served with an amazing tangy sauce. The fries were good, steak cut and made for dipping. The wings were better, I personally ate about 6 of them myself. The wings aren't spicy themselves but are served with fresh cut peppers that pair really well. The sauce was actually the highlight! I could have that tangy sauce with anything and it helped me get down some of the pie crust. KO pies has good inexpensive food for everyone. They served a couple different beers and are in a cool location away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The pie I had was OK but the wings and fries bump it up a start for me.

I was super excited because I've heard so many positive things about this place but when I came in last night, I guess I was a little disappointed. Food- first of all the food was the best part. Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS. The homemade pasta was what drew me into the place at first anyways. Environment- the restaurant was smaller than I thought it would be. It was also very loud; it was hard to hear what my table mates were saying. I felt like I had to shout to be heard. The table we were seated at was kind of banged up-- it was chipped in places and just looked sad and out of place for such a nice restaurant. The food is so good and expensive-- why was the decor just...lacking?Service- I'm going to preface this with this: I am also a server. I've worked in restaurants for about 1.5 years. I know how hard this job is, and the staff was working super hard. I am not super picky with the service I receive, but the service here still left much to be desired. The restaurant was quite busy, but our server just seemed out of it. She didn't interact with us much. Didn't even give us her name, or any introduction for that matter. I didn't know if we were supposed to request bread, but none was brought to us despite it being brought to other tables around us also in this server's section. We had to request bread. Also, I requested extra cheese for my pasta dish, and by the time the cheese got to us, I had already eaten most of the pasta, and forgotten about the cheese entirely. I'm sure she was busy but it still dampened the experience for me. Overall- probably would come back, but not planning to anytime soon. I don't think the whole experience was worth the $160 price tag for 3 people.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"477,4,"I'm so torn! My husband and I ADORE Sportello and have been coming for years! When out-of-towners visit, we always bring them here if we can snag a reservation. It's the home of my favorite pasta in the city! I enjoy the simple, open atmosphere and the big windows. Management (Mr. Moriarty) was gracious and wonderfully accommodating on one particular evening which keeps us coming back. However, multiple times, we've been served one particular waitress who has really dampened our dining experience. I'm definitely not one to expect too much or demand over-the-top service; I humbly say that I can be gracious to understand that people are people and people have good days and bad days. I appreciate great service, but am happy to let things slide as well. However, as we have gotten this waitress multiple times, I want to say that I've given her the benefit-of-the-doubt of having an off day here-and-there. Every time we've been served by her, she just doesn't seem happy to be there. I've never seen her smile while engaging with customers or otherwise. Her interactions with us have been short and minimal. We've always felt a little rushed. It's just overall dampened the mood of the meal. My husband is even more generous in terms of service expectations than I am, and even he has mentioned to me that this waitress has muddied our experiences at Sportello. I hope that if this waitress is unhappy, she finds happiness doing something she loves! Sportello is such a great concept in the city of Boston that I just hope the people they bring to their team can really get behind the dream and keep it the gem that it is!",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"478,5,"We had their spicy tomato soup, tagliatelle, and strozzapreti.

Â This is basically just plain butter lettuce with very vinegary pears. Â Not too special of a salad.*Warm bread - pretty good. Â We had two orders of this. Â Four half-slices of a baguette come in this order. Â The bread has oil on it, and is served with delicious olive oil. Â The first order of the bread was pretty hard, but the second was much softer. Â The flour is flown in from Sicily, which is supposed to give the bread a softer, spongier texture. *Strascinati (burgundy snails, opal basil pesto, toasted walnut) - delicious! Â You could tell the pasta was made right on the spot. Â It took a little while to come out, but it was definitely worth the wait. Â I greatly enjoyed this dish. Â The flavor profiles of all the ingredients complimented each other greatly, and I was pleased that this dish was not served in a cream-based sauce. *Tagliatelle - definitely order this with the bolognese sauce (it's a famous sauce!). Â If you do not eat meat or do not like bolognese, opt for a different dish. Â The portion is smaller than the Strascinati. Â The Warm Octopus Salad came highly recommended by our knowledgeable server, Katie (though we did not order it tonight).Blood Orange Sorbetti is made in-house and is very good. Â It's light, refreshing, and a nice way to end the meal. Â The cannoli also came highly recommended to us, but we wanted to opt for something lighter after the two orders of bread and pasta!Ambiance - 2 starsThe majority of the seating is counter seating. Â This gives the experience a much more casual vibe. Â The decor is quite plain, and the noise level is moderate.

I came with a group of 6 last week with reservations and we were seated immediately. We were planning to go for the restaurant week menu (3 courses for $38 - FYI these plates are smaller than a la carte), but had a great waitress and ended up going with the 3 course family style option for $55/person (yes we got upsold). But at least with this option, we could choose whichever dish we wanted. Here's what we got:Octopus salad: generous amount of octopus, warm and cooked perfectlyChicory salad: good portion but wasn't a fan of the tasteLocal cod: ok, not particularly memorablePork chops: ok, not the juiciest chop i""ve hadTagliatelle: EXCELLENT, best entree of the night. Sauce was delicious, i kept eating it even after the pasta was gone. Potato gnocchi: some of the best gnocchi I have ever tasted. They melt in your mouth like little nuggets of mashed potatoes. Not chewy at all unlike most other gnocchi. Sauce was ok. I appreciated the chunks of lobster it came withWe got 2 bottles of red wine to share - both were ok. Our total bill came $91/person with tip. WoofOverall, the food was decent but expensive. I would stick with their pastas because those were the gems of the night.

The service is always top-notch, friendly, and helpful. Ethan is one of the best waiters in the area, extremely funny yet also incredibly professional. The food is stellar. I've yet to have a single bad meal at Sportello. All of the house-made pastas are incredible, although there's a special place in my heart for the Bolognese (usually with tagliatelle). The spicy tomato soup is also a staple of mine and I can't get enough of it. The house-made limoncello is also good and has a great kick to it. A word of warning: most of Sportello's seating is counter seating. It's fine for two or three people eating together. If you have more than that, they will seat you at an actual table by the windows if one is available, but the tables are not usually for small parties. If you don't like counter seating, you may not like it here.Sportello is a little out of the way in the Seaport, but there's always plenty of parking in the area (metered or in one of the parking lots). You can also pair your visit to Sportello with a visit to Drink (either before or after) for some great craft cocktails.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"484,4,"Sportello is a casual dinning spot in the Fort Point area and I have been coming here for years now. I've tried several dishes over the years, but my standby and absolute recommendation is the tagliatelle. The pasta is handmade. It is thin, but has a slight chew. Very soft and fresh and also resilient. The pasta is perfectly paired with the bolognese sauce. Ground meat is well incorporated into the creamy rich sauce. My guess is that it is a mix of beef/veal and pork, I didn't notice any lamb taste. Parmesan adds a nutty tang. Fried basil leaf on top is mostly for decoration. I would have actually preferred if the basil leaf was uncooked, as it was oily and didn't have much taste. But some fresh basil would add a nice nuance.  Another dish I've gotten before is the dorade. A whole grilled fish with a pistachio crust and mint dressing, topped with watercress. The last time I ordered this it was stuffed with some citrus and herbs. This time the fish was not stuffed with anything. The fish meat itself is not very tender or juicy, but it is soft and easy to tear apart with a fork. This is a great dish to share. Especially since the saltiness and heavily seasoned skin can become monotonous. The crispy charred skin, with pistachio and paprika crust is where all the flavor is happening. However, the only nuance comes from the mint dressing. But, the mint is not evenly distributed and the heavy paprika, salt and pepper needs something to balance it. I don't know if this was an off day for the way the dish was made, or if the recipe changed since my last visit. Again, this is a dish best shared and coupled with something else off the menu to act as a balancer.Despite my criticisms the tagliatelle is more than enough to keep me coming back to Sportello.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"485,4,"It's too bad about our waitress.... Â The food was fantastic, the atmosphere was great, was a really nice evening apart from the experience dealing with our waitress (Megan L). Â She was completely emotionless, wasn't welcoming, didn't smile once, and wasn't attentive. Â She did her job and is knowledgeable but at the same time made my guest and I feel like we were annoying her by being there. Â It's a shame because everything else was great.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"486,4,"Some very tasty dishes stuck with me. I came to Sportello with a small group for restaurant week, but we decided to go rogue and go with the family style tasting menu instead. Everything we tried was satisfying, including the octopus salad, the pork chop, and the cod. What stood out, however, were the two pasta dishes we tried. The bolognese sauce was really tasty, but my favorite dish was the gnocchi with lobster, peas, and mushrooms. The sauce was rich and flavorful and the gnocchi were quite simply lovely (not a word I use for food very often, but they were so light and satisfying that it seems to match).The atmosphere was modern, but very casual as is typical in Boston currently. Service was friendly, helpful, and casual. Overall, we had a fun dinner. I recommend that you share dishes to try as much as possible. If we hadn't tried so many dishes and found the highlights, I would have probably not enjoyed dinner as much as I did.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"487,5,"What a wonderful experience.

Restaurant is open kitchen style and you get to sit around the kitchen and watch the hustle and bustle. We shared the octopus carpaccio, each had our own pastas (a must do because they are SO good and you won't want to share), and desserts. Carpaccio was divine and addicting. Pastas are incredible: as a not so big lobster or gnocchi lover I have to admit it was the best I've ever had. My husband also raved his pasta dish which had rabbit in it. I got the gelato of the day and he had the cannoli which were equally amazing.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"489,4,"I'm not the world's most adventurous eater and I never thought I would eat rabbit, but Sportello's strozzapreti with braised rabbit is hands down one of the most delicious pastas I've ever had!+ Strozzapreti with braised rabbit, picholine olives, rosemary ($27) -- My husband ordered this on our first visit here and I wasn't even planning on trying it, figuring that rabbit probably tasted gamey like lamb. However, he insisted I try a bite (his mistake!!) and I was in LOVE. I tried to play it cool and kept eating my gnocchi, but he could tell that I wanted more so, being the generous, newly-wed husband he is, he traded dishes with me!! I proceeded to devour his rabbit pasta. It's hard to describe the flavor, but it's definitely not gamey, and tasted almost like very tender chicken. The pasta was also a perfect texture and the flavor of the sauce was not too heavy but had a delicious umami savoriness to it!- Potato Gnocchi with lobster, mushroom ragu, peas ($29) -- This is what I ordered and I was really not feeling it. It wasn't just that the strozzapreti was SO much better, I just found this dish to be way too bland. The sauce reminded me of milk... just plain milk.On our next visit, we planned a surprise birthday dinner for a friend. I called in to make a reservation for 9 and found out some things about their large group reservation policy:Large parties have to do the $70 prix fixe ""feast menu"" and there's a 7% admin fee on top of the regular tax and 20% gratuity. Unfortunately, that was outside of the budget we had in mind so we planned to make a reservation elsewhere. However, after consulting with the kitchen, they graciously agreed to let us order a la carte for our party of 9, but let us know that if our numbers were to change and we have 10+ people, we would have to do the feast menu. (I can't remember if we still paid the extra 7% admin fee, but I think we may have.)During the dinner, I, of course, talked up the strozzapreti and almost everyone ordered it and everyone who got it was as smitten with it as me!",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"490,5,"This place is AMAZING! Every time I go the food tastes exactly the same, the way it should be in every restaurant. The tagliatelle bolognese transports you to Italyâ€‹ with the flavors. The servers are really nice, and it is pretty cool that you can see the kitchen closely. It is casual, nice, and great food. And don'tâ€‹ forget to grab an affogatoâ€‹ at the end of your meal.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"491,3,"Meh. I will be honest - this review is pretty much only for the lobster gnocchi. I went back and forth between getting the lobster gnocchi with peas and mushroom cream sauce or the tagliatelle bolognese. I made the wrong choice. I'm not a huge gnocchi fan anyway, but the reviews on yelp made it seem like the dish was the last stop before meeting god. I'm going to have to side with the other yelpers that said that the dish wasn't very flavorful. The pasta was kind of mushy, there wasn't much lobster at allll, the sauce needed salt or some other kind of flavor besides bland mushroom. My friends who got the tagliatelle really liked it. I'm not saying I'll never be back. If I do come back, I'll try the bolognese instead.The other reviewers who mentioned high prices and small portions are correct. This is a place with high-end prices, small portions and weird seating. Luckily, I was with a party of 8, so we got a table. I would have been annoyed if I had to eat my $29 mini-dish of pasta on a no-back stool crammed next to strangers. It's not my bag. I love Italian food more than life itself. If I get to choose, I'm going elsewhere.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"492,5,"Lovely. Wonderful interior. Great service. Loved the negroni, tomato soup and pea pod-shaped pasta.

The chef made me a special vegan meal which was pasta in a red sauce with vegetables. Others got the pork chop, steak, ramp tortellini, kale salad etc with a few appetizers. All said the kale salad was amazing.Drink selection was good and they were kind enough to bring some dessert wine for a birthday we were celebrating. So overall it was okay.",Sportello,"348 Congress St Boston, MA 02210"495,5,"Barcelona does everything right - service, food, cocktails, atmosphere. We live in the neighborhood and go there frequently and are never disappointed. Last night, we didn't have a reservation so we went early (around 5:45) and were lucky enough to get a nice table near the bar. An hour later we would have no chance of being so lucky. First, the staff are just great there. Not snooty, but very efficient. We had a tandem of servers that worked so well in conjunction with each other. The various team members, from the bread to water to the manager (Guy) who was greeting people and making sure everyone was enjoying their meals, are all excellent. So professional yet fun and friendly. As for the food, Barcelona is just a great place for whatever mood you are in. Their Tapas menu has food that appeals to vegetarians, meat eaters, fish eaters, etc. So you can always find nice things to share. We opted for the razor clams (my wife said were fantastic), ham & cheese croquettes (fantastic), grilled hanger steak and shishido peppers. All were great. For our main course, we shared the whole grilled Branzino. At $25, with a huge accompaniment of watercress and roasted potatoes, this is the bargain of the South End. (see attached pic).Finally, we love all the cocktails there as the bartenders are top notch. We opted for the pitcher of Sangria this evening. Again, at $30, this is a major bargain as it yields about 7-8 glasses of Sangria. Very tasty - not too sweet.All in all, we just love Barcelona and will continue to go back frequently.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"496,5,"SANGRIA. Say it louder for the people in the back! Trendy spot for tapas, with vegetarian and, drumroll, gluten-freeâ€‹ options. The hanger-steak, tortilla, croquettes and patatas bravas are the hoy-grail.

The menu has changed a tad bit but everything we got was delicious. The customer service was perfect; they didn't hover too much but they stopped by frequently enough.

Also the cocktails were very nice.,Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"498,3,"Yeah, no. Not the Barcelona I first experienced. And the fact that a visiting Sommelier got ZERO attention, leaving us to the ""experience"" of lovely servers - killed the mood for us. LOVED the croquetas and the bacon wrapped dates. But the much anticipated Paella de Chorizo and Morcilla with Garbanzos when a Seafood Paella was sent instead (with a ""seafood allergy on our table, AND THEY DIDNT COMP THE MISTAKE), fell flat on its lack of zocarrat and bland. I don't know what happened. The rice was overcooked, the paella had very little to no paprika flavor and none of the crunchy burned bits on the bottom. Another very disappointing dish was the fideua. The chicken fideua lacked crunch, was too salty and underwhelming.The place is super loud. Wines are spectacular. But the star plates of the evening were as disappointing as a blind date showing up in wrinkled and stained clothing - well-intended but poorly executed. I'm sorry Barcelona, we drove out from the 'burbs to meet Puerto Rico celebrity Sommelier and prized orthopedic surgeon Carlos Fraga and we were painfully disappointed. I had asked him to join us at Bar Boloud or Tresca, but he was looking forward to Spanish fare... I hope this isn't what you have become.... You have seen much better days!

At first, I wasn't sure if I picked the right place for dinner after watching the Boston Ballet's Romeo & Juliet, but our waiter from the very beginning provided excellent service and put us at ease.

The restaurant is a little hard to find, since it's tucked into a small street in the South End. The location also isn't too far from the nearest T-station, but it can still be about a 7min walk. We both started off with white sangria,s and I loved the light, refreshing taste of the drink, paired with bits of green apples. It was a nice contrast to the traditional, red sangrias, and I personally preferred the white sangria more! We were also served bread for the table, and it was warm, with a crunchy crust and soft inside. For the tapas, we ordered: + Grilled Octopus--very tender, and I loved the mustard-mayo sauce that came with it + Hanger steak with truffle steak--perfectly cooked to a medium rare with a nice, rich truffle sauce + Tuna Tartar--Very light, and perfectly seasoned with olive oil and capers+ Meatballs with ham tomato sauce--I'm usually not a big fan of meatballs, but these were so flavorful! The sauce also tasted great when dipped with bread+ Prawns a la plancha--THE BEST DISH! They were drenched in a very aromatic chili oil, the shell was crunchy, and the prawn meat was perfectly cooked+Churros with dulce de leche and WARMED! chocolate sauce--If you love cinnamon-sugar desserts, you will absolutely love this! It comes warmed to the table with caramel dipping sauce and warmed chocolateOverall, I loved my experience here and would highly recommend a visit! The service was great and the servers were constantly checking on us. They have a great variety of tapas, and also an amazing selection of meats and cheeses (and of course, amazing sangrias!).

I was surprised to see that there were about a dozen things that were ruled in for me. This can be a rarity to find so many options that are vegan.

Food was outstanding as well, definitely order the filet mignon, some jamÃ_n, shishito peppers, and mussels. Everything is tapas style so order 2-3 tapas per person.

Don't make it your first stop, don't make it your last. All the wine I got was great and the wine list is extensive enough for you to find something you'll surely enjoy.

The restaurant has a wide selection of affordable tapas. The serving sizes are tiny though, but I appreciated that because I could try different things.My dining partner and I arrived on a crowded Saturday night with a 7pm reservation. Those without a reservation were quoted a wait or 1.5 hours. The bar was flooded with people, and the restaurant was packed and lively. I got seated in 10 minutes.Because the restaurant was busy, it took a while for our cups to be filled.

I tried the hanger steak, the grilled ribs, the spinach and chickpeas, the egg plant, and a tomato fish dish.

Yes, it's tapas, so you pay a lot for a bunch of little plates. However, EVERYTHING here is delicious. The meat plates (bottom of the menu/save your stomach if you decide to order) are some of the best cooked, juiciest meat I've ever had. I think my favorite dish is actually the chickpea and spinach tapas - it has this amazing savory flavor that makes me want to actually eat vegetables. Also, DO NOT skip the croquettes - no one should miss out on those crispy balls of cheesy goodness. My chief complaint (and probably only) is that sometimes the menu can be tricky to translate. Most of the dish names are not in English so ask one of the friendly wait staff for recommendations if your Spanish is rusty like mine. Typically I would praise the wine list, but they actually have awesome cocktails here too! Excellent spot for noshing with friends or taking a classy date (only date people who are willing to share their food, obviously).",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"511,5,"I've been here multiple times, but never for brunch. The brunch was great! Brunch tapas style was awesome - I always never know if I should get savory or sweet for brunch but this was perfect because I got savory (veggie Benedict which was amaaaazing) and sweet (French toast also very good). Didn't get to do this but saw that they have a build your own Bloody Mary station. Would definitely recommend making a reservation - this place is always packed.

Oops. Better late than never though, right?To celebrate our anniversary my boyfriend decided to bring me to Barcelona Bar -- he'd been before with a family member and had fallen in love, insisting we visit. Because it was the holiday season (January 2nd) the place was unsurprisingly busy, so we were glad we'd made a reservation. We were quickly sat in a booth near the bar and as we waited for our waitress I took in the restaurant. It has the perfect vibes for a date night or a special occasion -- lots of dim lighting and woodsy details in other words -- and was filled with attractive men and women. If you don't already have a date Barcelona Bar might actually be a solid place to find one (haha). We started with a meat & cheese board (which I can't remember the exact details of) and continued with a few cocktails and many, many, MANY tapas. Here are the ones I remember: Calamari Plancha, Spicy Eggplant Caponata, Mussels al Ajillo, Blistered Shishitos (my boyfriend orders these EVERYWHERE), JamÃ_n & Manchego Croquettes, Albondigas, Grilled Pulpo (the highlight of the night, the octopus was crispy but tender at the same time), and Grilled Hanger Steak (another highlight). We loved everything and were both unbelievably impressed not only with the flavors and presentation of the dishes, but also the technique. The only dish I would NOT recommend is the Spicy Eggplant Caponata. It really doesn't taste spicy (at least to me) and is on the sweet side. And I swear, I'm not usually ""that person"", but the texture of this dish actually gave me goosebumps. It was cold and mushy but with enough bite to it that it lingered for far too long. Not pleasant. PS: We visited Barcelona Bar's Brookline location more recently and I personally prefer this location. While the other has more space (and better lighting) I find the South End location far more elegant and intimate, making it a better spot for dinner in my opinion.

Their excuse was that people were taking their time at the restaurant and not leaving. I dunno how restaurants figure out balancing reservations and walk-ins, but not being able to be seated WITH A RESERVATION until an hour later is unthinkable and a huge misstep on their part. Now, once we got seated, the staff was quite courteous and sent us several tapas on the house. This was probably Barcelona's saving grace, and the only reason this didn't turn out to be a two-star review. We ordered potatas bravas, spicy eggplant, octopus, and some type of meatball. We were given an additional order of potatas bravas, fried brussel sprouts, a cheese board, and a potato tortilla. At the time everything tasted delicious since we were starving, but looking back, the food was definitely lacking.The potatas bravas tasted were quite chunky and honestly just tasted like home fries from a breakfast diner. Octopus was way too salty and slightly over cooked, brussel sprouts and the eggplant were also quite salty, though they did have good flavor. The eggplant would have delicious mixed with a bowl of rice (sry my Asian is showing). The meatballs were only ok with flavors akin to a typical italian meatball in marinara. It was a mediocre experience at best.",Barcelona Wine Bar South End,"525 Tremont St Boston, MA 02116"514,5,"In love with the ambiance of this place.

We travel to Boston probably 6-8 times a year and always try to visit somewhere new. This particular time, we were in town for a show and my girlfriend's birthday so this was her pick. Man, did she nail it. We had a pretty early reservation to make it to the show on time, and mostly had the bar to ourselves. We got to hang out with Peter who's the OG of this joint, and a super nice, knowledgeable dude. In all, we had the shishitos, the wedge salad, the korean tacos, and the buttermilk fried chicken wings. Everything was great, but two standouts for us: reading, ""wedge salad"", you might think, ""meh, had about 1,000 of those"", but this was a much different, very welcome take on it. Along with normal things like bacon, blue cheese, and hard boiled eggs, were quinoa, asparagus, shredded beets, honey mustard. It might sound like a mismatched mess, but I tell you it was perfect. Every ingredient shined in it's own way and it was the most delicious, interesting salad I've had in some time. Then there were those wings. We've been down south pretty recently and their chicken frying is something else entirely from what I usually see in the northeast, but this was about as good as it gets. Crispy, tender, fall of the bone, right amount of salt. We were still talking about it 3 days later. Then there was Peter, casually asking about dietary restrictions earlier on in the meal and secretly delivering a gluten free dessert for my girlfriend. To say this place made our trip would be an understatement. Our next trip to Boston, we won't be trying somewhere new, we'll be trying the rest of the menu.

It saus on the menu that its ""the best in Boston"" boy, do I believe it! Hands down the best chicken amd waffles I have ever had. That waffle (though a bit small. Aparently you can order an extra if you want) was absolutely wicked. Purely insane! The texture, density, and flavor are nuts. It almost seemed like the waffle was lightly deep fried after it was cooked, to create the perfectly firm outer bits and deliciously moist soft insides. The chicken that comes with it must be the most tender chicken I have ever had, falling off the bone like you would not believe and perfectly crunchy batter crust. I asked for some hot sauce to go with it, as I always like that mix of sweet and spicy with chicken and waffles. I didn't use any, because it didnt need it, it was already perfect.Drinks and the bread putting for desert were also suitably delicious but nothing can top that chicken and waffles so I will just stop there.This place is now a must visit any time I am in Boston.Thanks again Peter and Asia! -John",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"518,4,Went here for dinner and had a wonderful time.

We didn't order it, but the fact that it existed was enough :DGrabbed seats at the bar and were quickly greeted by the friendly bartender. So far our service experiences in Boston hadn't been great, so this was a big plus right off the bat. We each ordered a cocktail (can't remember the names and the cocktail menu isn't online) - mine was gin based and his was bourbon based - we both enjoyed our choices. $12 cocktails, but they were great and lasted us the whole meal.For food, I had the Hawaiian tuna-salmon poke bowl and my husband had the Thai crispy chicken basil rice bowl. OMG, both of our bowls were delicious! I tried some of the chicken and it was cooked so perfectly - moist and flavorful. The fish in my bowl was so fresh tasting and the other ingredients complemented perfectly. There were definitely other things on the menu I'd love to try if in town again in the future. I also want to share this: apparently this night was our bartender's birthday. A local couple grabbed seats next to us at the bar and brought him home-made cookies for his birthday!

Â Most of the food was good too - the lasagna squares app really stood out, a must try! The local greens salad was yummy too, especially the crispy kale on top. Lows:The Irish curry was way too spicy. The chef did try to reduce the spice in the second attempt but it was still pretty spicy. I like that they asked us if anything was wrong and tried their best to accommodate our request. It didn't work but that's okay, it happens.What I don't appreciate is when restaurants sneak in charges. The Groupon was supposed to be $92 in value, covering 1 app, 1 salad, 2 entrees and 1 dessert. While ordering the entree, the server asked us if we'd like to add any protein to the curry. We did but apparently that's an extra charge not covered by the Groupon. That's fine but let us know beforehand, and not after I look at the bill and enquire. So even though our bill came to approx $75, we still had to pay for the ""additions"".",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"524,3,"My girl and I were seated promptly by the hostess. The waitress soon came by to take our orders. However, the food didn't arrive for almost half an hour. Service was also slow for the nearby tables. It felt a little weird to have both the hostess and waiter to check in frequently. We both ordered the burger. My girlfriend said her burger (medium rare) lacked flavor. As for mine (medium) was ok but I don't think they justified the price. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the food options back home in New York City. All in all there are more reasonably priced options in Back Bay and Allston. At least the staff was pleasant haha",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"525,5,"One of the best restaurants I've been to! Three words to describe my experience here: intentional, friendly, comfortable!I came here with a friend for brunch as we had a gilt offer for Moonshine 152. We ordered Mimosa, Crab Egg Benedict, and ""Gypsy Eggs"" with the spicy tomato sauce to the side. To my surprise, the chef brought out the food to us! How awesome is that?! The food was on point - good proportions of each ingredient to perfect the overall taste.Service was great. Everyone was helpful in answering our questions and providing the information we needed about the food and how to use gilt offer. I'd definitely come back even without the gilt offer.",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"526,5,"This is the best hidden gem in southie. I can't not say enough good things about this place. I've been here dozens of times. You must try the chicken wings, they really are the best. As a chicken wing lover, I have to say these are literally some of the best I've ever had. Also, try the Rangoon's, delish!! Their oysters too- always so fresh and perfectly shuckedThe staff here are literally the best, always friendly, nice, and personable. This is the perfect place to pop in to meet a friend, grab a delicious drink, and eat some delicious food and have a great time.",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"527,4,"Came here purchasing a Groupon for the dining experience for two. Was very easy to make reservations, not too busy for a Thursday evening. The ambience has pretty good dim mood lighting, and I appreciated the large booths - alternatively you could sit at a high top. The hostess and our server were both very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.The Groupon for two includes: 1 app, 1 salad, 2 entrees, 1 dessert. So our dinner consisted of: buttermilk fried chicken, house salad, steak frites, crispy flounder fillet (an extra side of brussel sprouts), and butterscotch pudding with an added scoop of peanut butter ice cream.The fried chicken was pretty good, the meat was fall off the bone with very crispy breading/skin. The ranch sauce it came with was also pretty good, and the celery slaw had the perfect tang as a compliment. The salad was a mix of greens with a mound of fried sseaweed on top. At first I was like nah, that's way too much seaweed. But the chef knows what she's doing when she designed this salad. The flavors and the texture contrasts were on point. I'd pay to have that salad again. The steak frites were ordered with the horseradish sauce on the side (will talk about that later), which would normally smother the steak on top of the shoestring fries. This can lead to soggy fries, so if you're not into that be warned. My dining partner didn't mind though and said that the steak was perfectly cooked. My crispy flounder was SO good. The fillet sat on top of two slice of fried green tomatoes, which when dipped in the horseradish sauce from earlier, was stellar. The sauce had tons of shrimp and tomato in it, an overall killer dish. The roasted brussel sprouts were also delicious - and this coming from someone who usually hates brussel sprouts. The ending butterscotch pudding was velvety and smooth and the perfect ending to the meal.So would I be back? Likely only for drinks as the bar area seemed happening. The food is a little too pricey for me to do on the reg, something that other reviewers have mentioned. Case in point, the side of Brussels sprouts were about the size of a small rice bowl (maybe 1 cup) and cost $7 - yikes! They were amazing....but still. We also had 2 Sapporos at $6 each.In the end I did enjoy this meal, simply because I felt like I got Â  a good value from it. I was able to get a 25% discount code on Groupon, so I didn't pay the full $55. Next, Groupon+ gives a cashback of 50% up to $10, AND THEN, I AIN'T DONE YET, Yelp gives a cashback of 10%. These cashbacks (linked to a credit card, so make sure it's the same one), which indeed stack on top of the groupon credit, were applied to the balance due with drinks, the side, and tax. Win, win, win!Also this shouldn't have to be stated, but do tip on the full amount. Don't be cheap. The receipt actually lists all the food you get as the Groupon sale price at $55. I added up all the items as they were priced on the menu and tipped off of that. Again, dont skimp out on the quality of the food and service that you get.",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"528,3,Everything was okay. I want to love it but food was okay and service was slow. I liked the concept of Parks and Recs though...,Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"529,5,"I LOVED everything about this place on our random visit. It's a really beautiful little place with a very fun, pub type of vibe. I wish I could recall our server's name, because he was pleasant and polite. My fiance and I ordered a couple of apps, cocktails, and entrees as well. We were NOT in anyway disappointed! Tequila Toddy: This guy was on their cocktail special for the evening so we gave it a try. This is a WARM cocktail, as you might imagine. Â Sweet, light, lemonlicious and soothing after a chilly walk. I thought that the slice of lemon with cloves was just a perfect garnish. Simple, flavorful, and sure to become a classic I'll formulate my own spin off of, no doubt. Manhattan: Stiff, strong, tasty, and classic. I order these in all kinds of ways, all over this country, and this is one of my faves. It was mixed well, chilled perfectly, and presented in a classic manner. LOVE IT!Bacon Wrapped Stuffing Bites: These were really freaking tasty! I mean who doesn't like bacon wrapped appetizers? These little bites were nice two bite sized pieces that come 4 to a skewer and were served atop an arugula/mixed greens salad and a really tasty vinaigrette. They were crispy, bacony goodness on the outside and a taste of the happiest holidays in the middle. I think this was a $9 appThrowback Korean BBQ Tacos: These were also THE BOMB DIGGITY!!! As a half Korean, I was excited to see this fusion on the menu. I was amazed at the simple, yet complex flavor combination of spicy, sweet, savory, and absolutely delectable! Asian pear kimchi and candied ginger? Count me in! You get to for $15Southie's Favorite Irish Curry: Again, this was a perfectly balanced plate. There was spice, heat, curry, rice, veggies, and BOLD delicious flavor. My fiance added steak atop his for an extra $10 making the plate $27 in total. The steak was cooked well, and it was a very filling portion. If anyone is curious, this dish does REHEAT in the microwave well, without changing the flavor.Mushroom Tofu Burger: Again, I was impressed with this burger. I have eaten LOTS of burgers in life, but this by far has been the best of the NON meat variety. Â I am not a fan of the texture of this burger, but it was a new thing to me all together. The burger had rich mushroom flavor, and the mouth feel of bread stuffing that has been crisped up on the outside. It came with house cut shoestring french fries, and toppings. This is a VERY filling burger that I was able to only eat half of. Â $16House made Shoestring french fries: These guys are thin, but weren't so much crispy. I Feel like they were very basic fries, but still tasty. I do plan on going Â back here one day to try out some more of this amazing, fun and creative menu. I feel like this would be a really good date night place for some adventurous eaters!",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"530,5,Buttermilk chicken is the bomb here! We also loved the party tots. Chef Asia is amazing and she is so personable and friendly. We will come here any time and highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some great food options!,Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"531,5,"Wow! Hidden gem. I don't usually venture to southie for brunch but now I will! We came by because I noticed that they make their own hash. I really dislike canned hash so I've taken it upon myself to hunt down as much ""real"" hash as possible.We had a Bloody Mary and an Irish coffee. The Bloody Mary was delicious!! Try the firecracker option. I had the crab eggs Benedict and my bf ordered the hash. The sauce on the eggs Benedict was AMAZING. Little light on the crab but that was as expected. Overall a great dish. Now to the hash.... just blew me away. It was perfect. I'm coming back for it! My bf barely let me steal a bite because he wanted it all for himself . I highly recommend this place!",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"532,4,"I went here with a few friends for Sunday brunch because there was a deal on Groupon+. I got the shrimp and grits, and it was pleasant. It was my first time eating grits, so it was like a bowl of mashed potatoes for me which I liked. The sauce was spicy, buttery, and overall very flavorful. It was garnished with scallions and caramelized onions and garlic slices. I was disappointed though that the shrimp was not larger. It's served with several bite sized shrimp instead of a few, larger prawns, which I didn't expect since the dish was $17.The menu is Asian-American fusion. There are interesting choices for starters and entrees, and they have a full bar with unique cocktails. The average price of dishes is a couple dollars more than I think it's worth, so I'd only come back with Groupon.",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"533,5,"Stopping in for dinner at your restaurant we were happy to enjoy the wonderful service, great food and neighborly advice!We visited Moonshine 152 after seeing Chef Asia Mei competing on Chopped.

The Bloody Mary with kimchi juice is so good my friend immediately ordered one after tasting mine. Shrimp and grits with an unidentified slight drizzle of Asian flavoring and strips of (bok choy?) is a new favorite. I know unidentified drizzle doesn't sound great - but I promise it's delicious! The only thing that makes this a 4 instead of 5 star review is the service. Our server was friendly and attentive even when the restaurant was busy. However as the restaurant slowed down we waited 30 min for our check, had other servers let her know we were waiting for her, and still had to stop her as she ran by our table.",Moonshine 152,"152 Dorchester Ave Boston, MA 02127"535,5,"Hooray for Locale's pizza! My fiancÃ© and I were in the area one late afternoon. We found Locale's dark exterior appealing, since we both love wearing black, even in 90-degree weather. Upon entering the establishment, we were immediately greeted by two waitresses. The place was empty, considering we came around 2PM. We started off with their toasted garlic bread. Highly recommend this. It's crunchy, garlicky and buttery. The bread also comes with a side of tomato sauce. For pizza, we ordered the Polpette, which is made up of their homemade tomato sauce, homemade meatballs, ricotta, and pickled chilies. A satisfying pie indeed! Everything about this particular brick oven pizza screams ""YUM."" The dough was toasted to perfection, and the meatballs just melt in your mouth. I can't wait to come back here.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"536,4,"A nice little place. My boyfriend and I got seated right when we walked in the door. The place was a little tight - depending on where you sit you can be kind of elbow-to-elbow - but you've got to keep that in mind when dining in the North End on the weekends. They did seem try to usher people in and out as fast as possible Â (I think we were in and out within 45 minutes). It's understandable because the place is small, but I was a lil disappointed cause I hadn't been here before and was hoping for a slow evening.That being said, I was a huge fan of Locale's food. We skipped the apps and just ordered pizzas - I got the Cacio E Pepe, and my boyfriend got the Tartufo. I was kinda worried that Cacio E Pepe translated to a pizza would be too dry, but it was honestly amazing. My boyfriend and I traded slices too, for purely unbiased opinions. I normally love mushroom pizza but wasn't the hugest fan of his Tartufo; he, on the other hand, seemed to be a big fan of the Cacio.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"537,5,"Whenever I go out to eat, the one thing I seek the most is value. In the North End--and even the City of Boston as a whole--the place that comes to mind is Locale. I've come here on a few occasions and have been thoroughly impressed by a number of things: the ambiance, the service, and more importantly, the food. On the nights I have come here, the restaurant exudes a cozy and warm atmosphere, with polished woods and fake (but still mood changing) candlelight. Furthermore, the service is prompt and attentive. But to me, it is the food that makes me return, as the pizzas are extremely high quality and unique to the restaurant all while delivering in great price point. The crust is slightly dense and purposefully just a bit burnt. There is a good amount of sauce, as I tend to prefer saucier pizzas. The cheese is stretchy and aids to the pizza experience in the way it should. What makes these pies really special is that they use charcuterie quality meats as toppings. Even eating one of their pepperoni pizzas will be a new experience. This isn't the place to get one giant pizza, as they only serve more petite style pizzas. However, it is a great opportunity to share and try out different combinations of toppings you would not have done so otherwise. Whether you're dining solo or with a group of friends, you won't regret a trip to Locale.tldr: cozy and comfy atmosphere with great food at great prices",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"538,4,"We've heard nothing but positive things about Locale, so it's surprising that it took so long for us to check it out. That said, the hype we'd been fed led to some inflated expectations. Locale lived up in some areas and was just okay in others.First, the service was really good. Our waitress was super nice and our plates were cleared and waters filled quickly. All of the staff that we encountered were pleasant. The space is small, but welcoming, and the prices are really fair, so on those fronts, Locale nails it!The food was good, but I wasn't left in awe, as I had hoped. The meatballs were quite dry, but they were still still decent. I'd imagine they're usually better, as one of the people in our group went there regularly and commented on the same thing. The margherita pizza was good, but not my favorite in the North End. The tartufo pizza was my favorite item, for sure, so I'm thinking you're better off ordering one of the more ""adventurous"" pizzas on the menu. Salads were larger than I expected, simple, and delicious.Overall, the food is good and I'd have no reservations recommending Locale for the overall experience. Sure, you can probably find better pizza and meatballs in the North End, but with the price points, chill atmosphere, and wonderful service, you can't really go wrong with Locale. Plus, it's slightly removed from the heart of the chaos that crowds the North End! Enjoy!",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"539,5,"Katie was the PERFECT waitress. She continuously checked in on us, apologized for having us wait ( which we really didn't and absolutely didn't notice), she gave us great recommendations and made sure we were okay the entire time.

Coming from a New Yorker, his pizza is ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC and if we could visit Katie every time we came we absolutely would. 5/5 stars for the restaurant and our waitress.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"540,4,My boyfriend and i stopped by locale as i was visiting him in Boston. We were looking for a place with good brick over pizza and salad and locale was perfect. The food came out extremely fast and we were not disappointed! We came on a Thursday night around 8 and were seated immediately. Definitely try the garlic bread appetizer it was super yummy.

Food and service there is amazing,Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"542,4,"Nice interior and fresh pizza in the North End!Locale is an affordable, brick oven pizza spot, lined with subway tiles and iron chairs. They have several tables and an open kitchen, cooking up fresh pizza and a few appetizers. We went on a Thursday night around 5:30pm and the restaurant was quiet and warm.We chose the garlic toast and the polpette pizza. The garlic toast came out served with hot marinara sauce for dipping. The toast was served as four rectangular slices, toasted with just the right amount of garlic.The pizza came out soon after, piping hot. The polpette has tomato sauce, homemade meatballs (which actually were not served as balls, but more of a sausage, maybe we got the wrong thing?), pickled peppers and ricotta. Delish!The crust was chew and crunchy. The cheese added a good amount of creaminess and rounded out the pickled pepper zing. At $16 for the pizza, it was very reasonable.The service was straight-forward and fairly friendly. This is a great spot if you're looking for good pizza but nothing to blow you away.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"543,5,"* BOTTOM LINE:Simple and good pizza places have gone out of vogue. Locale is a fantastic, unpretentious, and affordable pizza place in the heart of North End. Come here if you want piping hot wood fired pizza with interesting flavors and no frills. * THE SPACE / SERVICE: Small, but airy. There are mostly two and four person tables, which they can combine for big groups but it'd be hard. We went at 3pm on a Saturday and it was half full. Service was fantastic. Our waitress was kind and friendly and pizza came quickly. * PIZZA:The menu is simple but they do their pizza damn well. Us two got two pizzas and left with generous leftovers. Polpette - the meatball pizza -- meatballs cut and put on pizza like pepperoni slices. So. Good. The best part are the pickled chiles which add a nice tang to the pizza, which could easily get heavy. The special - white pizza with pistachio pesto and sausage -- amazing. This thing really highlighted how good the crust is here. It's sturdy but not too thick and the crust is insanely airy. They brushed the pesto on the crust so it ended up tasting like ridiculously good garlic bread. Overall, locale is one of the best pizza joints we've visited in a long time. Come here for freshly made pizza and a solid wine list!",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"544,5,"If you're looking for a place to have a romantic dinner or a fancy corporate outing this aint your spot, but if you are looking to grab an awesome pizza on the fast, you should definitely check it out. The oven operates at solar heat levels, so be expecting to see your pie in less than 5 minutes; great dough and excellent ingredients. I had the puttanesca (pizza version) and arugula salad and would repeat anytime.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"545,3,"I walked around for awhile trying to find a somewhat decent and well priced place to eat. It came down to here since the simple pizzas were more affordable than other places. It wasn't crowded at the time I went, but the service was good, at least before the crowd came in after 1230pm.The menu is short and simple. Each pizza is 12"". But if you're hungry you can finish it. I got the margherita pizza, which is cheese and basil, although a bit skimpy. It took a moment for it to come out, but it was quite good. The crust was a little bland, but cooked well, it was chewy and soft.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"546,4,"This small brick oven pizza shop is a great spot for a late afternoon lunch in the North End. I ate here with a group of 7 on a Saturday at 2pm, a little later than typical lunch time. The space was full of happy eaters.Between the 7 of us, we ordered 5 pies. They only come in a 12 inch size. 5 was perfect for us, with a couple pieces for leftovers. My favorites were the margherita (just a nice classic taste) and the spinach with ricotta. They brought us a balsamic glaze for that one, which was a great addition. My least favorite was the one with anchovies. I didn't think I'd like it, but gave it a try anyways. It was just a little too fishy for me. My dad really enjoyed that one though.I think about 3/4 of a pizza is plenty for one person, or a whole pizza if you're super hungry. They are reasonable prices, something like $15-19 per pie. To me, it's not a ""let's plan a fancy night out in the North End"" place, but it's definitely a ""I had this great pizza once, & if we're ever in the North End again, let's go back there"" place.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"547,5,The Tartufo is a must!!!

Must try.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"549,4,"Locale makes my favourite pizza in the North End. Aside from the occasional pie from Regina's or slice from Rina's, I'm all about Locale. I would recommend The Picante or The Rocco for its generous use of salami and sausage. I order take out from here often and don't have to walk far with my pizza. It holds up well. I've tried some of the appetizers both during dine-in and take out visits and I can't remember being blown away from the salads and meatballs. And maybe that's not to say the appetizers aren't great. Perhaps my mind, and stomach, are so focused on pizza when I have Locale in mind that the appetizers become an after thought. I don't know. But I can for sure attest to the quality and taste of their pizzas. It's the first restaurant to come to mind on pizza day!",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"550,2,"Stopped in on a Sunday night as we heard the pizza here was great. Service was sort-of friendly. We ordered one of their specialty pizzas with broccolini on it, but it didn't work with the rest of the toppings and was actually not very good. You would think they'd come up with topping combos that work. The meatball was boring, but fine. The pizza crust was pretty good. The overall experience was blah. I wouldn't recommend this place as you can't trust their flavor profiles for their signature pizzas.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"551,5,Wow! The pizza was great. We had the spinach and the tartufo and they were Â both excellent! Â The waitress suggested the meatball app and it was awesome!

The waitress was wonderful-helpful suggestions with food and wine choices and attentive.,Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"552,2,"Went to this restaurant for dinner. It had a nice atmosphere. The food did take a while to come out to us. We ordered the Calabrese pizza which states to have ""Sweet Pork Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Hot Cherry Peppers"" on the menu. When we received the pizza I saw that it had jalapeÃ±os on it which I am not a fan of. I tried one slice of the pizza hopeful the jalapeÃ±o wouldn't have too much of an effect on the other all pizza but I did not like this pizza at all. I let my boyfriend eat this pizza and I ordered the Piccante pizza which had pepperoni. This pizza came out much faster than the pizza before (about 1/4 of the time). It wasn't served looking quite as pretty as the others. This pizza was more to my liking flavor wise but the middle of the pizza was very soft and I didn't find biting into it to be very satisfying in that great pizza way. The crust was good but mine on my pizza was a bit burnt. My boyfriend did claim to love the calabrese pizza and was glad to have it to myself. The pizzas where decently priced at $17 and $12. Overall this wasn't a great pizza experience for me and I wouldn't recommend this pizza over quicker/cheaper by the slice pizza.",Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"553,5,"Fantastic find.

I would definitely come back and recommend it to others.,Locale,"352 Hanover St Boston, MA 02113"555,4,"Brendan and Becca: Went to The Gallows for a simple birthday dinner with some friends. The design of the restaurant is warm, with lots of creatively designed wood pieces. Overall, very attractive and fitting for the gastropub feel that they seem to be shooting for. We started dinner with the Buffalo Cauliflower and fried babybel cheese. Both were absolutely delicious. The cauliflower was refreshingly spicy without being overpowering. The cheese was cooked well, smooth and soft. We both had burgers. They were cooked nearly exactly the way that we had asked. Overall, pretty juicy and delicious. Frankly, neither of us felt that the burgers were anything special. Definitely not the best burger I've ever had, but certainly a quality burger that would bring be back to The Gallows. The service was great, no complaints here. In sum, a good experience that delivered quality food. Nothing life changing, but not every meal can can be. Definitely will be back. Would recommend to others.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"556,4,"Great experience here! Our server was super friendly and helpful, bringing us samples of their beer to try. She was very patient with us while we were placing our orders and checked up on us frequently during our meal. The food was great as well, we ordered the buffalo cauliflower to share and I got the falafel burger with pizza fries. Everything was fantastic except I found the french fries to be a little on the soggy side. Cool ambiance as well, its a little dimly lit with fake candles. I would recommend checking this place out.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"557,3,"Indifferent. That's how I felt leaving this restaurant after brunch. Brunch was for two people. We split a doughnut ordered a cocktail and two entrees. They don't have iced coffee, but they'll bring you ice on the side. Don't forget to ask for cream! They didn't bring/ask if I wanted any. I had the breakfast skillet. It came with a nice spicy aioli but lacked something. The eggs were undercooked and It had a flavor but there were too many potatoes. It seemed like they were trying to just fill the plate. Overall, I probably wont go back unless someone suggests it or wants to try.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"558,4,A party of 3 of us arrived slightly after 5pm on a Friday and there was no problem getting a table. The bar was popping and only got busier as the night wore on. We got the following items: Scotch egg - I have a soft spot for anything with soft boiled egg but this was delicious! Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. I loved how the egg yolk spread onto the sausage. This is much better than the scotch egg at hops n scotch. Simple poutine - I love fries but I will say that this was a bit boring and I will probably skip this next time or try a different version. It really wasn't anything special and wasn't worth the carbs or cost. Maverick burger with truffle fries - another item with an egg! It makes it extra delicious. The burger was solid and fresh tasting. I think it's a little more unique than other burgers I've had and would recommend this particular one if you're looking for a burger. The truffle fries were totally worth the up cost fee. It is probably the best truffle fries I've ever had because they were tasty and crispy at the same time. Fried chicken - the fried chicken was solid fried chicken but it's nothing something I would go out of my way for. I do recall it being a little spicy. I think they dribbled spicy sauce on top of it so beware of that. This is definitely a solid restaurant and will be back!,The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"559,4,"Loved the atmosphere of this place! It was a bit expensive, but the food was so amazing! My friend and I both ordered the breakfast nachos. We barely spoke the entire time, we were so consumed with eating the food.

It's the dinner special but was extremely underwhelming and lacked flavor.Spanish Octopus - an amazing flavorful dish. 100% would get this every time. Well paired with the bread.Classic Poutine - exactly as the name states a classic poutine. Simple and delicious.South Korea Poutine - had kimchi, short rib, and other classic Korean flavorings. It was made well. The flavors went well with each other and it was quite tasty. Would get this one again as well.Overall 4/5 as most of the dishes were good and the service was great!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"561,4,"Pretty cool place. The ambiance is really nice, and I liked the decor. The drink list is really cool, there were some really fun options and creative cocktails. I got the Queen Bee and it was light and really flavorful at the same time. I really enjoyed how fresh it was. Our service was really good as well, prompt and efficient without feeling like they were right next to us the whole time. I HAD to get the Scotch Egg when I saw it on the menu, I had not had one since I was in London over 10 years ago and was so thrilled to see it, and it was delish!! My friend and I both got the Pub Burger. It was delightful and the onion aioli really hit the spot. This is a cool little spot, I would head here again just for a refreshing cocktail and a Scotch Egg!!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"562,4,"Stopped by The Gallows for brunch this past Saturday. We ordered the Sunrise Poutine and the Corned Beef Hash. The Corned Beef Hash came with a ton of food. The hash was homemade (nothing that resembles catfood) and the sourdough toast was fresh as well. The Sunrise Poutine was divine. A brunch spin on traditional poutine, so fries, gravy and cheese curds but with 2 eggs and bacon in top. This portion is giant and could easily be eaten by two. The service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was quaint. Perfect for Saturday brunch. One thing that struck me as odd: We asked for poached eggs instead of sunny side up and were told they can't poach eggs? What brunch/breakfast establishment can't poach an egg? We settled on over easy and they were still delish.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"563,5,"I've been going to The Gallows for a couple years now and they have consistently maintained the same level of quality and excellence in food service. I had Emily as my server as she commanded the back booth section. It was getting later in the night, and i believe that her section was closed after seating us. I only know this from working in a restaurant and could tell they weren't going to seat anyone else there. This did not stop Emily from providing high level service. She was attentive and checked in on time every time, never rushed us at any point. We ordered The Daily Catch & the Steak Frites. Both were cooked to perfection, the risotto was amazing. The drinks were also both tasty. I will continue to make date nights to The Gallows, so long as the consistency remains present.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"564,5,Found this place on our last visit and what a cool place it was!The staff was friendly and accommodating.

The place is modern, dimly lit, ok for a date, and fun. I got the steak frites (28$). The steak was just ok. Not the best steak i ever had but still edible. The fries were actually horrible. The salties fries u can ever find. I hope i dont get in hypertensive coma. Lol. I had a glass of red wine accompany the meat ($11). A friend ordered the mousse dessert. It looked like cappucino but i think she was happy although couldnt finish. Overall great ambiance but average food. Would i go again? Possibly but i wouldnt be too excited.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"566,5,"You know, eff it -- I'm gonna give this place 5 stars. When I have friends visiting and they tell me they're craving a burger, I love taking them to this trendy and very classy bar and grill. With walk-ins, I never have to wait too long. I really dig the cabin vibe of the wood tables and walls and hanging dim light fixtures that criss cross along the ceiling! We started with their Scotch Egg which, if you can imagine, is a soft boiled egg wrapped in pork sausage that is then fried crispy. FRIED. *le drool* I sank my teeth into their Brie and Apple Burger which was not on the menu the last time I visited. I like that they change it up every now and again. Keeps me coming back! I think they'll cook the burger ""medium"" (aka perfection) unless you request otherwise! The staff is incredibly friendly and always open to make suggestions! If you order a burger, you can ask to upgrade your side of fries to truffle parmesan fries or poutine so why not? You're here for a good time, not a long time. ;D",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"567,4,"We were looking for a relaxed atmosphere to get dinner our first night in Boston. Thanks to Yelp, I found The Gallows which had great reviews and was a 20 min walk from our hotel. It was around 8:30 when we arrived, but it was Wednesday so there were a few open tables. I tried the Queen Bee cocktail to start. It was a delicious mix of Pear-infused gin, ginger, honey, lemon, and prosecco. It was fabulous!!For our meals, my boyfriend got the fried chicken and I went for the Mook burger. The chicken was plentiful and breaded to perfection. It was served with a spicy honey sauce that had quite a kick. It was a good kind of kick though that didn't make your lips burn for an hour after the meal. The bacon potato salad was also really tasty. I'm going to need to find a recipe for that!I was a little nervous about all of the items on my burger. It included Italian charcuterie, fresh mozzarella, basil pesto, balsamic aioli, pickles, lettuce, tomato. The flavors of everything together was like magic! It ended up being a fork and knife burger because it was super messy. I ate the entire burger and most of the delicious fries served with it.This was a great opening to our Boston food tour and if we ever make it back to the city, I would definitely return!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"568,5,"Nice atmosphere and delicious food.

This place is a sure bet for yummy food, drinks and overall experience.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"569,5,"Was looking for a cool, young atmosphere bar and restaurant and found the Gallows! The theme is pretty dark in here - the wall has a huge ouiji board and the general atmosphere is pretty warm, but decorations tip off the darkness (also, clearly from the name, The Gallows). Drinks were SO GOOD. My friend and I had the Queen Bee and Smokey and the Bandit, both were amazing, great taste and not too strong. We shared a plate, something with carrots, which was a new combination of veggies for me. The only thing, the service was a little odd... the waitress was kind, and strangely folded our napkins for us when either of us left the table. Not sure if it's a cleanliness thing, but doesn't change my opinion!",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"570,1,"This was my favorite place to grab a burger in Boston. However, management in their infinite wisdom, decided to get rid of the Maverick burger (and Truffle fries) and that royally makes me mad. I only went to the Gallows for this amazing burger topped with pork belly AND a fried egg. Make your mouth water?? Well, FU because it's no longer available.Bring back the Maverick and I will be back. Otherwise, time to find another best burger in Boston.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"571,3,"A solid 3 star, but not quite 4. Had a couple of drinks (Diet Bud the menu calls Bud Light). Ordered a half order of Poutine. It was good, but not great. Very crispy fries and a good brown gravy, but the cheese curds were the consistency of soft feta. I'm not sure if they were homemade or if they just don't know what a cheese curd is. A good cheese curd is required for good poutine. I ordered the chopped salad. Absolutely fantastic everything bagel croutons. Too many chick peas. Tasty balsamic dressing. Wife ordered flat top grilled burger. Great beef taste. Nice soft bun. 2 drinks. 1/2 app. Salad and burger. $55. Â Meh.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"572,4,Really enjoyed this place. Got a table for 6 on a Friday with a day-before reservation. We started with some fries. They have about 5 to choose from. Definitely great to start. I got the Maverick burger and it was awesome. Literally left that place knowing I ate too much. Bar scene looked crazy busy too. Definitely would go back. Service was excellent.,The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"573,4,"Came for the monthly pig roast - held the second Sunday of every month. Roast pig, cornbread with melted maple butter, chilled broccoli salad, Velveeta mac + cheese, creamed corn, chopped slaw, Texas toast, and bread and butter pickles - unlimited, all for $25. Included is one free beer from the partner brewery that month. For June it was Otter Creek Brewery.The only downside is the AYCE is served by the tray (see photos), but the kitchen can accommodate and make you a platter with only the sides and parts of the tray you want. Also service was wicked slow which can get in the way of eating all the pork your little heart desires.Overall 3.5/5. Definitely want to come back one day and try their regular menu.",The Gallows,"1395 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"574,4,"Oh, Gallows...you are sort of becoming my regular when I want to class it up a bit but keep it close. Â While the beer selection isn't as expansive as I would like (I tend to go to Five Horses if I'm looking for a range of beer), this is my first choice if I'm looking for a range of food. Â I'm partial to the fried chicken and poutine, but could be persuaded to explore other things on the menu.My only complaint is that when I sit at the bar (which has been every time I've gone), sometimes the bar staff cares more about interacting with each other than interacting with the patrons (unless they are regulars). Â I haven't dined in the dining room so can't comment on the service there, although the hostesses are always friendly.

This has been our third visit and I'm looking forward to our next. Our first visit was a lager group and we were impressed at how smoothly they managed our group. Apps and drinks (beer and wine) orders were quickly taken. Everything was amazing. Â Calamari was crisp and delicious as was bruschetta. We all ordered something different from menu and everyone was very happy with choices. Last night we met friends there again for dinner, as expected it was busy, they did fall behind a little at reservation seating but not a problem at all. Again we ordered calamari and Â caprese salad. The veal Marcela is delicious as was the lobster ravioli. Service is very friendly and accommodating.

We've come here many times before, but haven't seen the current bouncer (young man in his 20s) before. He initially told us it would be a 30-40 min wait, but we ended up waiting 2 hours because he let many parties of the same size in before us even though they arrived later. He was also extremely unprofessional - not only did he never update us on the wait time, but he blatantly pulled out a stack of 20s from his pocket and counted them while standing beside the entrance. I understand that bouncers often take bribes, but this was just ridiculous - they should know how to do it to a reasonable extent. Will not be returning anytime soon.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"577,4,"I'm so excited to have finally crossed this place off my Boston bucket list. I visited the south end location today and was able to get a reservation about 2 hrs prior to our desired seating time which was awesome ! Upon arriving we were seated quickly and given bread. The location was very small and I felt like I was essentially on top of the people nextto us but the bread was very average & the olive oil and balsamic were really good ! We order a bottle of the $20 chianti and shared an order of calamari which was pretty good and I got the butternut squash ravioli and my boyfriend got the chicken parm. The portions are HUGE. The butternut squash ravioli was creamy and delicious (although it said it had pancetta in it but I didn't see or taste any) and my boyfriend enjoyed his chicken parm. All in all it was a great meal for a good price. Here's my final summary:- great value - not frills or ""instagrammable"" setting - will likely be back but absolutely not worth the 1.5 wait that many other reviewers have endured !!! Capitalize on the south end location allowing reservations!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"578,4,"** NOTE: CASH ONLY **I'm fortunate that this place is down the street from me as the place can get really crazy come dinner time on the weekends. Â If you want to have a good shot at walking in to be seated then I would suggest the middle of a weekday!Service the night we came here was prompt (Tuesday night) and fortunately it wasn't crowded to a point where one would have to shout for the other to hear which can be the case if you come in on a weekend for dinner. Â I went for the lobster ravioli which was quite good. Â The sauce was rich and creamy and there was a decent amount of lobster in each ravioli. Â The price is also quite reasonable for what you get. Â My partner enjoyed her Frutti di Mare as well (though she was disappointed they didn't let her combine the red and white sauce that night). Â The Caesar salad and calamari were quite fresh and delicious. Â No complaints there! Â So far the service and food have been quite consistent for us so we'll keep coming back!

I had the fracamo (fra di avolo + giacomo) frutti de mare and fried mozzarella. A bit on the salty side (i had to drink a ton of water when I got home), but delicious at the moment. Usually has a wait so I recommend making reservations (only the south end location on columbus ave allows reservations), and payment is cash only.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"580,4,"I first went to Giacomo's on the North End 10 years ago, and I still dream about the seafood pasta in fra diavolo sauce to this year. Â I remember it as the best Italian food I ever had, and even after traveling extensively through Italy in the next few years, I'd never had any pasta I loved as much. So this past trip to Boston I made sure to stop by. Â I didn't realize that there were now 3 Giacomo's in Boston instead of 2, and accidentally set my Google Maps to the South End location instead of the original. I had wondered why the neighborhood changed so much from what I remembered. This location is slightly more expensive but there's a lot more space, so we were seated immediately. I think? they also have AC, or in any case, it felt a lot cooler inside. So I'd say for not having to wait on an especially humid day, it's worth it to come here. We ordered a house salad, which was kind of meh, and the half lobster, clam, mussels fettuccine special in fra diavolo sauce, and the lobster ravioli in Giacomo's sauce. Â We all loved everything. The fettuccine was perfectly chewy, and tasted fresh not made from dried pasta. The sauces were a bit too salty for my liking but still phenomenal. The lobster ravioli surprisingly didn't include cheese, according to our waiter, and just contained chunks of lobster. Even though the portions were huge, we still sopped up the last of the sauce with the generous hunk of bread. Â The wait staff was extremely efficient and very nice as well, keeping our ice water filled and giving us extra plates without us asking. Â Why 4 stars instead of 5? It doesn't quite live up to my memories of my first visit to Giacomo's. I remember the mind-blowing fra diavolo sauce being more watery instead of gloopy as it was here, and not being quite as salty. Â Perhaps I should've visited the original North End location to adequately compare, perhaps my memories just deceive me. Still, this was the best Italian food I've had in years, and you need to stop by if you're ever in Boston.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"581,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by Giacomo's. All of my friends and coworkers hyped this place up so much that it took me a few years to muster up some semblance of motivation to try it out, and wow am I glad that I did! My date ordered the frutti di mare pasta and I ordered the lobster ravioli. We also ordered a calamari to share.The calamari itself was by far the best I have ever had because it was fried to light, crispety, crunchety perfection. The marinara sauce was also light, not too salty, and actually enhanced the flavor of the calamari instead of masking it like so many other places. I snuck a bite of the frutti di mare and it was very flavorful, but holy cow, the lobster ravioli was perfect. It was a bit al dente but the added texture made the dish more interesting. The sauces were incredible all around and I'm already planning my next date night at Giacomo's!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"582,1,"Great food ruined by their cash only policy. Nearest OPEN atm was 0.5 miles away. Had to leave my wife in the restaurant while I ran a mile to get more cash (now I feel like I'm going to puke). It's 2018, I can pay for things by waving my phone in the air, accept credit cards for goodness sake.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"583,5,"We're from out of town and this place was recommended by a local. Â Great food, huge portions. Â The calamari was really light and tender, mozzarella sticks were huge, and all our pasta entrees were excellent.

Â Cash only, so be prepared! Â The wine list is really inexpensive, so we were pleased to get a Rosso Di Montalcino for $37. Â Final thing to take note of, this place is LOUD!!!

I was surprised that I able to secure a booking for a table for two even though I called only hours before dinner time on a weekday. The fruitti di mare: Quite delicious. I went with the nonspicy red sauce( the other two red sauces are spicy). The clams and mussels pasta: a tad too oily Ambiance: cramped and the noise level was very high. Tables were close to each together. This is how I would rank the seafood pasta I have tasted in Boston so far: 1. Fruitti di mare at Carmelina's ($27.82)2. Lobster fra diavolo at Daily Catch ($69, for 2 persons) 3. Fruitti di mare ( nonspicy red sauce) at Giacomo's ($21)4. linguine alla pascatore at Panza ($16)5.

I've been meaning to go back but tend to avoid the north end because of the lack of parking and long lines. I am so glad I discovered the south end location since this one takes reservations! The restaurant is small and tables are places very close together which became slightly annoying when I had to get up from my seat 4 times for the people at the table next to me to get in and out. Despite the tight space here, it is actually bigger than their north end location. I was seated promptly and immediately knew what I was going to order (the same dish I got last time). It was the house special: seafood pasta for 2 for $65. This is the most expensive dish on the menu but it is huge and delicious! You choose your own sauce; I decided on the fracomo sauce. The sauce is a bit runny and I tend to like thicker creamier sauces but it was still delicious. You can easily split this dish between 3 people and the seafood is plenty! You get a whole lobster split into two sides, clams, scallops, mussels, squid, and shrimp. I'm glad that after a few years passed before coming back that they haven't downsized this dish or raised the price. I definitely satisfied my Italian craving by visiting this restaurant!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"587,5,"Oh Giacomo's you have won my heart. I've been to this location and their other location in the North End and the major difference between the two is whether you want to line up for 2.5 hours (North End location) or not. As much as I love the anticipation in waiting for delicious pasta, I opted for the Back Bay location this time around since they allow reservations and I had a large party. My group of 8 ALL loved their dish. From the calamari (the best I've had in a while -- the crunch factor was perfect, it was fresh, and the salsa dip they gave was the perfect pairing), the garlic bread, and my favourite go to order, linguine + clam + scampi, I was so satisfied, everyone was satisfied, and it did not break my bank.Whenever someone comes to visit Boston I always recommend Giacomo's because I think it's the best introduction to all the great Italian food Boston has to offer.",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"588,5,"Food was delicious!!! :) we went out with friends on a Saturday night- it was pretty busy but we had reservations... be prepared for a wait if you haven't made reservations. Their butternut squash ravioli is amazing and they were nice enough to make it vegetarian! Service is great- a little slow but that can be excused because the place was packed. Only negatives- the place is very loud and also, it's cash only. The vegetarian options are limited on the menu but they were friendly enough to modify the food such that it is vegetarian! So definitely worth a visit if you're in Boston!",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"589,3,"I feel like the north end location was slightly better, but it may just time softening my view of the food. In any case, this south end location has two major advantages: location and reservations. It's still cash only though.The swordfish and tuna in the pesto cream sauce with fettuccini (17$) was okay. The fettuccini was predictably good, the sauce was too heavy for my taste (super oily), and the swordfish/tuna chunks were kind of average. The Zuppo di Pesce (65$/two people) is essentially all the seafood in their choose-your-own-linguine with the addition of lobster. As a result, it's much more expensive than getting two of the choose-your-own-linguine options. It's quite tasty, and their linguine remains very good. However, the sauce (fracomo, one that I've had at the north end location) was super watery and as a result, didn't stick to the linguine very well. This was pretty disappointing. The lobster is also really annoying to eat when covered in sauce and the some of the clam shells had shattered in the dish. Honestly, I'd go for the regular choose-your-own linguine options over this, which is what I'll do when I go back",Giacomo's,"431 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"590,5,"This place is perfection! It never disappoints! This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Boston, of all time. Â The south end location is the only one of the locations that takes reservations (The North End and Melrose do not). Â Call ahead for a reservation, and if you're willing to eat at 5pm when they first open, get a reservation for that time. Otherwise, even with a reservation, plan to wait (pro tip: the bar next door has amazing truffle fries!).It's worth the wait! The service is always spot on (attentive but not smothering). Â The wine by the bottle is SO reasonable (most are $21/bottle). Â The food is always fresh and great quality and cooked to perfection. I've never had a bad meal here ever.

I wish we lived closer because I'd probably eat here once or twice a month if we did. The Chicken Parm was equally amazing and rates up there with some of the best I've had.

It's also quite loud, but it does give off the North End vibe although it's in a normal part of South End. We also loved the manager, who was super funny and welcoming. Our waitress was quite slow (I think it may have been her first day) and we waited a while to order. Once we did order, the food came out in a normal manner (I'm guessing/hoping they freshly cook everything, so we didn't mind too much!). The table bread was mediocre, as was the actual pasta. I ordered the dia frialo pasta (linguine with mussels, shrimp, clams, etc). The seafood was plentiful and shrimp was especially tasty, and the sauce was delectable .

The picture is quite attractive, don't be fooled, I just like to take pictures",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"598,3,"[3.5/5] Stopped in for lunch as part of The Boy's 'Tour of Boston Carbonaras.' We were able to get seated by the window with sunbeams shining on our table. I ordered a glass of white wine and we got the Mom's Meatballs and Ricotta to start. The meatball was quite good and I loved that they served up a cool, refreshing ricotta; however, the ricotta had a truffle-y essence to it and that was not listed in the menu and it caught my tastebuds by surprise. I'm not sure if this was intentional or maybe some carryover from something made or a utensil used before. I enjoy truffle to a certain degree but I personally cannot handle to much of it and am surprised they don't mention it as some people entirely dislike truffle.. The ricotta cream was still good, but just beware of the truffle flavor sneaking up on you in certain bites.The Boy got the Spaghetti Carbonara (of course) and I got the Paccheri al RagÃº. The Boy loved the pancetta in his pasta but found something to be desired in the sauce; it coated the spaghetti well but left little extra at the bottom of the pan - a little too thick/full for his liking. My ragu - essentially a meat sauce (lamb, beef, veal, & pork) - was outstanding. I did think the rigatoni could be cooked a smidgen longer as it was chewier than I liked it to be. I took leftovers home and reheating it cooked the pasta to just the way I liked it.Service was great and I really enjoyed the lunch ambiance. Trattoria's menu is pretty standard Italian fare for the North End and will serve you all the classics you're looking for. Definitely worth trying if you're craving a traditional Italian meal as it'll cover all the basics and then some.",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"599,4,"Been here twice now -- once for lunch and once for dinner. I highly recommend coming here for lunch because the outside patio is lovely during nice weather. It feels like you've been transported to another place. Trattoria il Panino has two locations; we ate at the location off of Hanover, so it felt more private. The food was amazing. All the pastas are fresh and such an amazing texture and flavor. I ordered the pesto and you could tell that it was made in house. The portion was so generous, I had to take most of it home! My friend ordered the lasagna of the day; I had a bite and it was one of the best lasagnas I've had. It had so many layers and was stuffed with meat and covered in cheese. Service was awesome. Our server was very nice and quick to answer any questions we had; water service was also prompt. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time as well. The prices are a little high, but I feel that's representative of the North End. Definitely recommend!",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"600,3,"Food quality is a 5 but service brought it down to a 3... Â Wow! I don't know where to begin... food quality is great! Sooo impressed with the bread, olive oil... thought we were starting off on the right foot. lies!We were seated right away. Our server was waiting on us in between bites because she was eating in the back of the restaurant. Another patron was vomiting by the bar. They throw straight disinfectant in the area... Undiluted! Our eyes and throat begin to itch so we move... they say they will give us another table and forgot about us. So as we're waiting... they give our food to us with no table or silverware??? I know, I know... 1st world problems but are you kidding me? No one apologized, checked on us... then they gave us a table with no utensils, water... we were hungry... we took off clean utensils from a clean table... ate and went on our way. Seriously? Is this place trying to make money??? Lasagna-tastySpaghetti carbonara- flavorful and generous portions.Seriously, their food is good but not worth those prices and terrible service!Update!!! As we were about to leave, the Â manager met with us and heard our concerns. She was helpful and comped our meal. I am torn with scoring because food was excellent, initial service really sucked... but the manager really saved our dining experience. Because of her, we would actually come back and give them another chance.",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"601,5,"My husband took me here for a fabulous Italian and meal, it did not disappoint. Â We had calamari that was very crispy and fresh. Â I also had a mojito, which was so good(and strong). Â For our meal, we had lobster and mushroom ravioli.

We were starving and ready to eat anything. We were quickly seated in the basement although we had requested to sit upstairs and enjoy the outdoors patio. The hostess said she would check on availability (we just saw the table leave upstairs as we were walking in), but she never got back to us... The waiter was very friendly and attentive. I got the mushroom and truffle ravioli. It had 5 or 6 (I think?) very large ravioli. I couldn't finish it and had to take the last two home. The price was very steep but I think that's just Boston prices. It was way better than the lobster ravioli in my opinion. Overall, the dish was very heavy and only had other pastas on the menu. This is great for someone looking for that type of food but probably not for me. I'm glad I tried it once.",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"605,5,"Came here for dinner over the weekend, had the ragu and my friend ordered the Lobster Ravioli. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! Our waiter was very friendly, very italian and kept calling us ""Bellas."" Lol The ragu was very filling even though it didn't seem like a huge portion, and I love how the pasta dishes are served from the skillets! Really cool concept and adds a little something extra to the experience. Also, the complimentary bread and olive oil were fantastic. The olive oil had such a strong flavor and tasted like something you would try in Italy!Overall I would definitely visit again, prices are pretty standard for the North End. This place is tucked away on a side street right off Hanover so it can be easy to miss!! Definitely keep a look out for it!!",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"606,5,"I don't think I could ever come here and not order the mushroom ravioli. It is so creamy with delicious mushrooms! I come here far too often but it great for groups! The more I try to expand in the North End the more I end up craving Trattoria. The meatloaf is always my boyfriends favorite and it never disappoints. Always make a reservation here! Just in case. It is pretty packed any night of the week. The only thing on the menu I've ever ordered and didn't like was the baby octopus dish - it was super fishy and didn't taste right. Everything else from the calamari, muscles, lasagna and ravioli have been amazing!",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"607,3,"Don't get confused with the main restaurant around the corner on Hanover St, which is not open for lunch. Â This location (they may be connected in the kitchen, I don't know), is a completely covered patio open to the street.The first time I had lunch here, the food was decent, nothing special, and service was fine, although a bit clueless (how many different servers can ask you what you want to order?).The second time, on a Thursday around lunchtime, I stopped in for a glass of wine while waiting for a friend. Â The staff member who greeted me refused to seat me in the 2/3rds empty restaurant unless I ordered food. Â Well that's fine, as restaurants have policies (and they are just around the corner from a restaurant which has a long line and I'm sure they don't want to fill up with people just wanting a glass of wine until their tables open up at Neptune lol). Â But the server mumbled a very dismissive reply to me (young guy with black hair, accent and scruffy beard), which I thought was quite rude. Â How about smiling, looking me in the face and saying, ""I'm sorry but...""?Obviously, you don't need me as a repeat customer. Â I'll go to Daily Catch or Carmelina's instead...",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"608,4,"Came here for restaurant week, but ended up opting for the normal menu. We were seated on the side near the stairs (had to walk through the whole restaurant and passed the kitchen to get here). Apparently this is the same restaurant, but it is different in terms of the liquor license?? It'd be great if someone could clarify. I wanted to order a HIGHLY-HYPED espresso martini, but I couldn't because they could only serve beer or wine on our side. Interesting rule, but just a heads up if you're sitting in this area. The food was delicious though, which made up for this silly rule. I ordered the lobster ravioli in a crab meat sauce. My friends ordered the chicken parm, spaghetti carbonara, and fruitti de mare. All of the above were delicious. I loved the skillets, so the food stays hot. The prices were also very reasonable considering we were in the North End. Unless you want something very heavy, I'd refrain from ordering the carbonara and the lobster ravioli. The crab meat sauce is THICK. This place is also open till 2am, so need I say anymore? I can't imagine you getting higher quality drunchies anywhere else (besides salt and pepper squid in Chinatown).",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"609,4,"Overall - Trattoria Il Panino is a nice place for dinner where you'll surely have left overs. They serve the food in pans, I'm guessing the food is cooked in these though not sure since the pan doesn't arrive that hot.The food - I've had a some of their pasta dishes as well as their meatball appetizers. One of my favorite things about this place is the meatball app. Though it is a little bit on the pricier side, the meatballs are delicious! The meat is perfectly cooked and has flavor in it of itself. The meatballs come with a lot of sauce that is so tasty! The sauce is thick and perfectly seasoned with a dash of basil and a side of some fresh tasting ricotta. My two favorite pasta dishes here are the gnocchi and clam pasta. I don't tend to order gnocchi as I find it too heavy but this is the exception. The sauce that the gnocchi comes with is really good and very creamy with some fresh cheese pieces on top. The clam pasta is lighter and just as tasty with some zest to it.The place - it can certainly get a little packed, especially during the weekends. The first time I came here was on a Sunday and I had to wait, though not for long. This latest visit was on a weekday night and they had spots at the bar which we chose to take. The place is large and it can get a bit loud at times, though nothing crazy. Inside it's a bit dark but if you're lucky to get a seat near the windows it makes for a good bright spot and great location for people watching.Definitely would recommend and would be back!",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"610,5,"My mom and I went here while she was visiting me in town. I have been to many North End Italian restaurants, but this one is definitely one of my favorites to go to. We went during lunch around 1pm and they sat us right away. The area we sat was not particularly big, but I believe there are more rooms dedicated to the restaurant. Â Our waitress was friendly, and so was the rest of the staff. They made nice side conversations and were very helpful.I ordered the Ravioli Porcini, and my mom ordered the Paccheri al RagÃº. My food was absolutely amazing. It came out decently quick and it was so rich in flavor. The portion size was just enough for me. I finished the whole dish, but that also could be because I loved it so much!

Your dish is served in a pan.They don't skimp on the lobster; you get actual, large pieces of lobster within each ravioli!For a North End restaurant, with a beautiful ambience, and a lobster dish, the price is super reasonable.I can't wait to return - and though I should probably try something new -let's be real.I'm getting the Ravioli Con Aragosta and I'm going to love it.",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"614,4,"Dropped in here for drinks and dinner with some old friends. I'm surprised I've never stopped in here before!We had wine and settled on sharing four appetizers - which ended up being more food than the three of us could handle. We had the calamari (crispy and tasty fried seafood, but nothing special), the Shrimp al limoncello (GET THIS - four huge shrimp in the most wonderful garlic sauce you've had - you will be sopping up the leftover sauce with bread and dying of happiness), Mama's meatball (two tender delicious meatballs with a generous dollop of ricotta), and the mozzarella special (so soft a light on the inside, yum!). The waiters were friendly and kept track of you glass remaining full. Minus one start for pricing. $14-16 per appetizer is a bit high for what you're getting, even in the North end.",Trattoria Il Panino,"11 Parmenter St Boston, MA 02113"615,5,"All I can say is WOW! When it comes to food quality this is at the very top of my list for Italian! I thought I've had amazing pizza before, but after eating their Half Bronx Bomber and Half Fig & Prosciutto Pizza I was wrong. This is BY FAR the best pizza I have had and that says a lot for someone who eats as much pizza as I do! We also tried the Old School Tuscan Bolognese Pasta which was deemed the BEST pasta EVER by my fiancÃ© ! The ambiance was nice as casual and located on a great spot in Beacon Hill. If you get a seat next to the window, you will have a great view of Beacon Hill. The price was a little above average, I spent about $54 on two people but have plenty of food left over for later! This could have easily fed 3 people. Overall, this place is highly recommended ! Try it and you won't regret it!**This review was based on trying this place more than 2 times. I believe in trying a place multiple times before reviewing in order to give an honest and fair review.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"616,4,"A friend gave me a gift card to Figs so we made our way there to check out the pizza. Located on Charles Street in Beacon Hill, it's narrow but cozy inside and it's a nice, casual spot to grab a pie. We had a reservation, which I would recommend given the popularity of this place, and we were seated quite quickly. As we looked over the menu, it was clear by observing the tables around us that the turnaround time was pretty short from ordering to getting the food to the table.Given the name, I assumed that the fig and prosciutto pizza was the most popular one but our waiter indicated that Red Sox with his favorite. It had tomato sauce, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, mozzarella, Italian sausage, and a lemon aioli drizzle. I was skeptical about the sauce as I don't typically like a lot of sauce on my food, and definitely not topping my pizza. But, this actually worked quite well. The pizza was so flavorful and well seasoned, from the meat to the red sauce, to the veggies on top. We opted to split the pie with half Red Sox and half Bronx Bomber, which was essentially cheese pizza topped with pepperoni and basil. Pepperoni pizza is a classic so it was great to try their version of it. Large pieces of deli sliced pepperoni topped the mozzarella cheese. The crust was thin but it remained crispy, particularly under the Red Sox portion.Pizzas are primarily between $20 and $25. They also offer appetizers that are hearty such as chicken parmesan sliders and meatball sliders, as well as salads, pasta dishes, entrees, and a few sides. We tried the garlic, rosemary and parmesan fries, which were very underwhelming with packaged parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and whole sprigs of rosemary. We did not detect any garlic, salt, or pepper, all of which those fries needed.The service was swift and adequate but certainly not overly friendly. The efficiency was good here. I could see this being a great place to call in an order for pick up if you lived in the area, or to grab a quick bite for a weekend lunch or a casual dinner.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"617,1,"I disliked:- I was naive and trusted the reviews, I dislike myself for this- calamari appetizer is fried and was disgusting; it has no calamari, just dough to make you full; it's a giant portion so don't get fooled by quantity because you're not eating calamari, they are trying to distract you with quantity - pizzas were so lame; cheese tasted like rubber, figs were overpowering the pizza, way too sweet- way too loud, you gotta be drunk to enjoy the atmosphere - slow serviceI think the only reason this place has good reviews is because people are drunk here or cheap and just wanna have lots of food, coming in groups and sharing the plates. So if you're cheap or coming in a group that is cheap and you don't care about quality, you might enjoy it.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"618,4,"Visiting Boston for only a few days, I knew I had to try this place due to favorable recommendations by friends. We arrived without a reservation, so we had no expectations to be seated promptly. Â The wait time for our party of three was approximately 15-20 minutes during non peak hours which was slightly longer than expected despite many open tables being available for parties of 2. Â  The service was very professional, the ambiance was inviting, prices were reasonable but the Bronx Bomber pizza was just ok. Â The toppings were fresh but they were overshadowed by the slightly burnt Â pepperonis (pics). Overall I did enjoy our lunch, but make reservations first.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"619,4,"I celebrated my birthday with my best friend by having lunch at Figs on a Friday. We made reservations for 1pm but came about 20 minutes late, which didn't end up being a problem since there was ample seating. Figs does gourmet pizza alongside other Italian/America entrees. If you and your party can't pick between two types of pizza, the best part is you can half of each. We ordered fries with parmesan, rosemary, and roasted garlic to start. At $8, I was expecting more than just ingredients thrown on top, but perhaps we just assumed there was going to be truffle or another type of oil to help things stick on more. Overpriced and not very worth it, considering parmesan is offered on the table. For pizza, we chose half figs and prosciutto and half red sox. The figs and prosciutto pizza is amazing! Definitely a pleasant and surprisingly delicious combo of crisp rosemary crust with fig and balsamic jam, prosciutto, and gorgonzola cheese. The red sox was a little soggier, still good but not particularly noteworthy. The pizza does get cold fast, so eat quickly! Overall, Figs is a good dining option if you're going to be in the Beacon Hill area, but unsure if I would come out of my way here again. Still highly recommend the figs and prosciutto pizza!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"620,5,"Figs has some of the best speciality pizzas in Boston!

If you're on any sort of diet, prepare to wreck it if you're at Figs!My friend and I came right at noon on a Sunday and I'm super glad we did. When we left around 1pm, the place was packed and there were even people waiting outside. If you're gonna come for lunch, come right when they open at noon! We ordered the pizza with 2 different halves: Prosciutto + Fig on one side and the Red Sox on the other. The Prosciutto was hands down the winner and next time I'm just gonna get the entire thing with prosciutto. It's a beautiful combo of generous prosciutto slices with fig pieces, all lovingly drizzled with olive oil. Yum!! It does get a bit oily though so be warned it's a messy slice! Also the pizza is more like a flat bread than what I would traditionally think is a pizza. If you're a thin, soft crust kinda person, you'll be super happy here! We also ordered a side of Brussels Sprouts with butter and pancetta. Delicious and super rich! Seriously butter makes everything taste heavenly so brace yourself for some very decadent bites!

I'll def be back - but only for the Prosciutto!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"625,5,"This place is AMAZING. The ambiance was intimate and cozy, location is great, the employees are friendly and make excellent suggestions and the food... well it is phenomenal. For a group of four the waiter recommended we split two salads, two appetizers, and a pizza... and that is exactly what we did. The salads were unique and tangy but i would highly recommend trying the chicken parm sliders. They were great! As for the pizza, we did half and half of the fig & prosciutto and the Red Sox pizza. Both were out of this world amazing. They serve the pizza on a large cookie tray and the presentation is quite impressive. The pizza had a really unique flavor and as a born and raised New Yorker (s/o to the best pizza in the world) even I was impressed by it. Will definitely return just for the fig and prosciutto pizza!!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"626,5,I love Figs! I live in Beacon Hill so I do take out often. They are fast so make sure to head there after ordering because the pizza does get cold sitting there. I've had a few of the pizzas. You can split the pizza and get two types. My favorite is the calamari. You get an insane amount of calamari to cover the pizza. I was hesitant about the lemon aioli at first because I prefer my calamari with plain lemon and marinara sauce - but the lemon aioli really makes the pizza. It is super crispy and delicious. Best when eaten at Figs. Another one of my favorites is the crispy eggplant. I wish there was a little more ricotta cheese to help balance the pizza. The egg plant is very crispy and makes a great topping to a classic pizza. I've had the Red Sox pizza but didn't love the mustard aioli on that. I think it would have been better without it. Â If you order a pizza online there's no where to tell them to split the pizza with two types of toppings. I just call in and tell them how to edit the order. They charge you for the most expensive pizza if you split it.,Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"627,5,"I am sooo happy this location has reopened after the fire, since Figs has long occupied a special place in my heart (and my stomach). Â Their uniquely topped, free form, thin crust pizzas are part of my childhood, and I just love them more and more each time I have the opportunity to chow down on them. Â I think I prefer the Charlestown location, since the more central Beacon Hill spot gets very noisy and crowded, making for a slightly more stressful dining experience (claustrophobes beware!), but it's still so worth it for me. Â They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait up to an hour during peak times. Â Given the tiny size of the restaurant, this often means waiting outside, so checking the weather forecast before committing is not a bad idea. But despite these caveats, if you do go through the rigmarole of getting in and getting a table you will be well-rewarded with delicious pizza creations at surprisingly reasonable prices. Â My favorites are the Oliver's (traditional tomato, basil, mozzarella), the fig and prosciutto (w/balsamic jam and gorgonzola), and the Isabelle's (country ham, provolone, asparagus, sweet onion, eggs), but there are many more great options. Â They do half-and-half pizzas as well, so you can really maximize your flavor sampling.Maybe my history with the place have given me a bias, but they have never disappointed me in all the years I've been going to their three (now two) locations.",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"628,5,Best pizza I've had in years.

This will definitely be our go-to spot for when we're feeling lazy. The space is small, but very cozy. If there's no tables available when you arrive, looks like your only option would be to wait outside (not bad if it's nice out, not fun if it's cold!)Side note -- we sat at the bar and the stools were hands down the most uncomfortable thing I've ever sat on.

The restaurant in extremely tiny, not conducive to large groups at all... but it's tiny in a warm and cozy type of way. Perfect for me as I came by myself. There were only two servers here and since the tiny place is packed out (every seat taken, couple people standing at door waiting), there's a little bit of a wait in ordering/getting food/ etc. But they're clearly working hard, so I didn't mind. Bread and olive oil come out first, and you can tell it's fresh baked bread. I ordered a couple of strange sounding things just to have a culinary adventure: 1. Cauliflower Bisque - perfectly creamy with some golden raisins, a bit of parmesan cheese, a pesto drizzle, and some croutons. Sounds weird, WAS weird, but also really really good! 2. Fig and Prosciutto pizza - some kind of fig jam type stuff (instead of marinara sauce), and large slices of prosciutto, with an EVOO drizzle. Yall... I'm weird about pizza because I'm not a fan of a thick or doughy crust.. This was the PERFECT crust for thin crust lovers of the world! Super thin, but it held up perfectly under the topping and had the perfect crunch too! The pizza was HUGE. Everyone else who ordered a lizza is sharing one among the whole table. I got weird looks getting one for just me.

I don't know what kind of bread it was. I think it was onion bread, but it was moist and sooo tasty! My friends ordered the Tuscan Pizza and I ordered the Spaghetti Pomodoro with Tuscan meatballs. The meatballs melted in my mouth and the spaghetti was bouncy and perfectly cooked. I could not recommend this place enough. The prices were a bit high, but I am unfamiliar with the prices of Boston. The area that this place is located in is so adorable too so it is worth stopping by. We strolled through the Boston Commons and ended up finding this place! I would definitely recommend bringing a couple people so you can share entrees and try more than one thing!",Figs by Todd English,"42 Charles St Boston, MA 02114"635,5,"I went here for a birthday dinner and I'm surprised how well they were able to accommodate such a big party for a Friday night. I believe my friend did make reservations so that definitely helped. This reminds of the MD restaurant in Allston, which the similar theme of Korean style food and large TVs with Korean pop music. The only difference is that there's a live dj and pretty much this place turns into a wonder bar in Allston but down the Fenway area instead. I have to say the food is soo good though, honestly I think I prefer it over MD. Way more flavorful and a lot more variety. Foods:Crunchy corn - basically sweet corn kernels mixed in some kind of fried breading. Reminds me of the corn pop cereal Cheesy corn - Korean delicacy app, basically half and half mixed with melted cheese and mixed corn. The only con to it is that if you don't eat it fast enough, the cheese hardens and it gets hard! Con:Although parking is unfortunately difficult unless you don't mind paying for Summary:A new hotspot to try!!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"636,4,"Perfect place to wind down on a Friday evening after the work week with fried chicken and beer. I stopped by recently to catch up with some friends, after hearing good things about Sojuba.The inside is large and pretty clean, with lots of colorful lights. They play a mix of house/dance, K-hip hop and K-pop, and top 40. You can request songs as well. One of the servers has a soft spot for BTS Â which I appreciated a lot. Later at night, the lower floor is cleared of tables and turned into a dance floor.The three of us ordered army base stew and a small soy miso fried chicken. The stew is good comfort food, but a little salty for my taste. There's rice cakes on the bottom of it, so eat accordingly! The fried chicken is crispy and flavorful. Get beer if you order the chicken for the full fried chicken/beer experience. The imported Korean beers are a bit pricey, so the Sapporo is probably the best bang for your buck. The food in general seems pretty legit, so it was quite tasty.I'll be back! Lots of tables ordered the watermelon drink (perfect for big groups in the summer), and I have yet to try the Melona cocktail.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"637,3,"This was my first time at SOJUba and it was a fun experience. My friends and I went for dinner and ordered bibimbop, bulgogi, seafood cake, and udon. I was mostly gravitated towards their soju cocktails because they had ones that I'ved never tried. The hostess helped us grab a table quick. She told us it would be a 20 min wait, but it ended up being 5-10 minutes. We appreciated that since we were really hungry. The waitress helping us was really nice too and gave us our food as fast as she could. The food was alright. I was surprised that the bulgogi was spicy. We were really shocked and ate carefully. The bibimbop was good too, but smaller than I imagined. It's small enough for one person to eat.We ordered aloe and yogurt soju cocktails by the pitcher. I would think that I would of been at least buzzed, but I think the ice watered it down. I don't encourage it, but it seems like next time I have to drink it quick once I order it. Overall, the drinks were good.The atmosphere is like a night club scene. There were lights flashing and K-pop music playing loudly. I loved it because it made it more exciting for us since we weren't expecting it. They also have sparklers for people's birthdays.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"638,5,"I'm SO glad I had the chance to try Sojuba! My boyfriend and I arrived for dinner on a Tuesday night around 7:30 PM. There was no line and plenty of space since it wasn't Friday or Saturday night. It has a very club-esque environment, complete withâ€‹ flashy, swirly lights, k-pop music videos playing on screen (and the Red Sox game), lounge-yâ€‹ seating, and a bar.We started with their soju drinks- I had the aloe soju and my boyfriend tried the screw bar soju. I loved the aloe bits in my drink! It was a good combination of boozy and sweet (and nostalgic- I LOVE aloe!). The screw bar soju came with a glass of beer and a shot of liquor. For food, we shared the:- Spicy fried chicken- we chose their small size, so it came with eight pieces (in total) of wings and drumsticks. It was super spicy, so I was only able to eat one drumstick. The sauce they used was plentiful, flavorful, and packed a lot of heat. The outside was slightly crispy and the inside was tender.- Dok Bokghi- it was a favorite at the table! It consisted of tender rice cakes, assorted vegetables, and fishcakes drenched in a spicy-sweet sauce. The sauce contained a perfect amount of heat and was so savory. The portion is on the smaller side.- Kalbi Tang- we thought a beef stew would be a good way to conclude the meal, and it was! This dish consisted of a rich beef broth, vermicelli noodles, scallions, and short ribs (less of the meat, more of the bone). I was really surprised by the broth because it looked watered down, but taste-wise, it wasn't! It paired nicely with the side of rice they provided. :- ) I would've liked more vermicelli noodles to enjoy with the broth.Our servers were super sweet and attentive throughout the night! I had a wonderful experience here and would love to come back sometime!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"639,5,"Where do I start? If you're looking for a place with good food, good vibes, good music. You don't have to look any further. I've been here on numerous occasions and like last night, it was an absolute blast.Made a reservation for a very large party and they were really accommodating with such a short notice. Weekends are usually pretty packed so I would recommend calling way ahead of time to be on the safe side. Our waitress Tristine and the rest of the staff went above and beyond with making sure that all of us were taken care of with whatever we needed. We ordered literally everything on the menu from Korean wings to bimbimbop. Key to most peoples hearts starts with good food and Sojuba doesn't disappoint. They have an outdoor patio that's nice and chill to hang out or just enjoy dinner. The atmosphere can be loud with lights and different decor on the walls. Music ranges from Korean hip hop to Edm but song requests can be made. If you're trying to have a slightly more chill vibe, make your way up to the bar upstairs which has small booths along the wall for you and your friends. I'd definitely recommend Sojuba and can't wait my next visit. Parking can be tricky but there is a parking lot right next door that is only $10 on weekends.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"640,5,"This would be a really good place to visit on the weekends! The inside is huge, and there are many TV screens around the place playing Kpop videos. The interior is also decorated nicely with lights and disco balls. The servers were incredibly nice as well. We got the boodae jungol, which came with ramen, tofu, vegetables, rice cakes, sausage, and spam in a spicy soup base. It came on top a stove so it was hot throughout dinner. The fried chicken was also pretty good (the original flavor was good but the other ones with sauce are probably better).",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"641,4,"Came here with a few friends for dinner on a weekday night, so it wasn't crowded or busy yet. The staff informed us that the cook was stuck in traffic, so we could only order drinks if we wanted. We waited around and took our time deciding what we wanted to get. We decided to order the soy garlic wings, fried squid, and the kimchi dumpling hot pot soup. I also got the melon soju and my friend got the screwbar soju. The food is pretty good, the chicken was crunchy but nothing too special. Our hot pot soup was piping hot and all the ingredients got mixed in well to make a delicious tasting stew. I preferred the screwbar soju over the melon soju since it's much sweeter and honestly just tastes like juice. I'd recommend trying it if you have a sweet tooth! The servers were great, always checking in with us, but gave us space to catch up over dinner. The drinks were on the house, since we waited a while for the chef to show up, which we really appreciated being compensated for our time. This is a great addition to the Fenway area for food and drinks.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"642,4,"Apologies to Myung Dong on Harvard Ave but Sojuba is taking over as the Korean bar to go to in Boston. The menu is more extensive, albeit not any cheaper. The food quality is more restaurant than bar, which is enough to convince me to ""trek"" to Fenway. The cocktails are my style aka lemon soju cocktail tastes solely of lemonade. They also have a variety of Korean and American beer. The outdoor patio basically seals the deal and makes this non-bar person a fan of Sojuba. The one missing star is the music. I'm squarely in the korean music camp. I've been here a couple times and the music is more American on weekend nights, so for Korean music, basically have to go pre-8pm. Which is probably for the better of my wallet; otherwise, I'd be here every weekend. For food, I've had the budae jungol (army stew for two) - really beats out any other army stew I've had at a bar. There's tons of tofu, spam, ramen, all the delicious things. I'm willing to have this spicy pot in the summer. The stir-fried spicy squid is a perfect bar dish with chewy squid and thin wheat noodles to mix in. This place also has my favorite pajeon/scallion pancake, super crispy not too chewy. I haven't really like soondae/blood sausage before, but the soondae makes their soondae bokum a go to order. The ttobokki is decently spicy but not overwhelming, would love to get the ramyun ttobokki next time. The service is generally nice and friendly. They get a little overwhelmed as a new bar with a lot of real estate to cover and therefore potential for some things to slip through the cracks, but I think I've seen the owner will step in a take an order as needed, which is great to see. Overall, I've been impressed with the food, drinks, and service, so I'll be back soon enough.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"643,4,"I've had my fair share of Korean cuisine in the area, as our city is certainly well represented if you're looking for a Korean fix. But Sojuba fills a void I never even knew existed...Korean lounge. Sojuba sits on prime real estate in always busy Fenway. TV's, DJ booth, speakers blasting Kpop, and plenty of alcohol. This is certainly nothing like the many traditional sit down family Korean restaurants you'll find nearby. It's hip, its young, it's cool, and it's absolutely delicious. I'd recommend the scallion pancakes, fried rice, and of course Korean fried chicken. The glass noodles (or clear) are also quite satisfying. I wouldn't exactly say I am fond of Korean cuisine. It's certainly not my go to, but when a certain Korean everything 'obsessed' Â family member comes into town, I already know what I'll be having....for the entire week.... Thank you Sojuba for helping end my week on a high note. Easily the most pleasant Korean experience I've had to date, and that's including LA Korea town.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"644,5,"The place to be if you're looking to drink soju, eat and have a good time. Music is good, the venue provides a lounge setting. My friends (group of 3) came on a Thursday night - 10:30ish and the place was sha-poppin'! Sojuba was packed, including the bar area. We got on the wait listed and ordered a watermelon soju at the bar. While waiting for the drink, we were able to be seated at a table. The watermelon soju literally came in a watermelon (refer to all the instagramable pics in the picture section of this business page). Cotton candy was included with the drink which I thought was pretty unique. We met the owners and they were great hosts. I noticed they stopped by each table and knew a lot of their customers. I love that they make sure you're having a good time. Steve taught us a couple of drinking games which added to the fun. Good vibes, good drinks and I'm sure they have good eats. Check them out!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"645,3,True rating is 3.5. Sojuba (also called Jyuba??) Is like the Myung Don 1st Ave of Fenway. Theres a good food selection in addition to cocktails and loud Kpop. I was disappointed that they do not offer traditional side dishes like most korean restaurants do!I also ordered the tofu soup which was good in quantity! Taste was expected but nothing remarkable. I really wanted to try their popsicle cocktails but I couldn't justify spending $10 on it considering I could buy 2 boxes of melona and soju for nearly the same price.,Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"646,4,"My friend and I came here on a Friday night for drinks. Music was bumpin' a lot harder than we expected upon arrival. It was about 9pm. Tables were filled. Since we only came for drinks, we ended up taking a couple seats at the bar. I regret not getting the bartender's name because he was pleasant all night. He greeted us right away and handed us food and drink menus. We opted for the corn cheese appetizer (WHICH WAS SPECTACULAR!!!) and a couple melona ice cream soju cocktails. We got yogurt soju cocktails during our second round. Everything was wonderful. The melona ice cream soju was fun and delicious, but I LOVED LOVED LOVED the yogurt soju. The yogurt soju is slightly carbonated, which added (and very subtly) a little extra. I'm also glad we decided to sit at the bar. It was a show watching the bartenders prepare all the cocktails.There was a DJ, who was energetic and friendly. He worked the mic especially when leading birthday songs to patrons at tables. Music choice included radio hits and, for the lack of a better term, ratchet rap and hip-hop. Still, it was fun. Come with couple friends or group. Don't come with your mama.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"647,3,It was supposed to be a 30-40 minutes wait but ended up being about an hour. The vibe is nice though and they play music videos so the wait wasn't TOO BAD but still lol. Flavored soju is $13 there and the food is actually okay. The kimchi pancake was crispy on the edges but also soft on the inside and had a good amount of spice in it. The fried rice thing was really good it almost tasted creamy but I like that a lot. Had a lot of flavors and wasn't bland! It's just really loud and so it's not that intimate and when we got to our table I almost drank out of a cup that was used and I guess wasn't taken away. It had lipstick stains on it.,Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"648,4,"Based on a spontaneous solo visit one day and then a visit with my crew weeks later, I have to say Sojuba is a pretty cool place. This place is definitely very much a Korean bar through and through and delivers in that regard well. The alcohol is definitely where Sojuba shines as the Melona soju cocktail and the Screwbar soju cocktail were both refreshing and were fairly smooth. (Plus you get a popsicle). Regarding the food, the fish roe stew wasn't particularly filling and generally only had fish roe and fish cake. Gizzards are a workout for your mouth with a tough, chewy texture that may not be for everyone. (I tried it out of curiosity). The dumplings were ok but didn't really stand out. Â However, the service was on point with Tristine being a pleasure to have as my group's waitress and she accommodated our needs well throughout the night. Usually, I am indifferent about the music in a restaurant but Sojuba earns major points for blasting Kpop that I ended up shazaming and started listening to. (Training Zombie by New Champ is one of my new favorite pump up songs). They do switch to more American music here and there, but you can also request for different songs that you like (another brownie point there). Overall, if you are ready to get turnt with soju to the tune of the latest Kpop or Korean trap, this is the place in Boston to visit. Â IG: Mood4foodeatery",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"649,4,"You definitely come here and pay for the experience. Everything else is just extra. Sojuba is a restaurant/bar whose insides are set up to look like a cracked out, high energy Korean club. The lights are dimmed inside the restaurant with strobe lights going off in the background. The seating is half patio furniture, the other half basic tables. Waiters bring you these plastic water recycled bottles filled with tap water for your table. There are giant TV screens playing a variety of music. When we first sat down on a Friday at 7 pm, we were welcomed with rap music. Later the music switched between Korean rap and KPOP. We ordered:1.) Spicy Chicken Wings- 3 stars (If you want to burn your insides that this is the dish to order. We could eat any of these wings at first because they were just too hot. After we requested honey mustard sauce from the waiter, we smothered our wings and could actually eat them.)2.) Chicken Bibimbap- 4 stars 3.) Scallion pancaked- 3 stars (I've had better. This pancake was barely crispy and disintegrated in your hand.)4.) Screw Bar Cocktail- 3 stars (I ordered this because I wanted to try this whole popsicle in drink concept but my drink was WAY too sugary) This establishment is definitely a place to go with friends for a cool fun experience. I wouldn't come back because the food was subpar and the drinks were sugar bombs. But I am glad I came at least once to take in the very cool atmosphere!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"650,4,"Come here for the drinks and atmosphere, maybe skip the food but drinking appetizers are always welcomed. Flavored soju bottles and soju cocktails go for $10-13 each. Sojuba welcomes parties of friends just order drinks in an atmosphere that is dim, with Korean music and flashing lights - so similar to bars I have experienced in Korea.The food is overpriced with corn and cheese going for $12 and seafood scallion pancake for $18. The fried chicken has minimal flavor and is not nearly as good as Bonchon's or Crave's. The Boodae Jungol is pretty good but it's a pretty basic hot pot with a base and spam, ramen, veggies, etc. added.",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"651,5,"One of my favorite spots to go to. I made a reservation on a Wednesday night to throw a surprise dinner for one of my best friends. I brought a bunch of balloons and decorations but the table we were assigned to was in the middle of the floor -- our server was extremely kind and moved us to the lounge area by the bar so that I could put up the decorations. Not only did she make it more convenient, but the owner himself came over to help me set it. The customer service was above and beyond.On to the next important topic, food. It's amazing. We ordered chicken, boodae jungul, chicken gizzard, japchae, scallion pancakes, and kalbi. Everything was really delicious and came out quick.I highly recommend everyone to check this place out. It's a fun and chill spot to go to. Music is good and they have the perfect drinks to play drinking games!",Sojuba,"1260 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"652,5,"10/10 recommend. If you plan on going with a large group during the weekend, I'd suggest you to make a reservation. The restaurant gets filled with groups and may stay long to celebrate. They charge you a minimum holding fee, just be aware. Y'all must get the Melona Soju (with popsicle), wings (spicy and original), and bbq short ribs. Everything we ordered was good too but those were my favorites. The only thing I wished they had was a parking lot because parking in Fenway is kind of tough. Also, we thought we were designated to one server but they said to find any server to place an order. I'm assuming they work as a team! Bring your squad because the more the merrier.PS. If you buy a bottle or minimum of 10 soju bottles and beers, you'll get a light show. You'll feel like you're at a VIP table at a club.

It's a fun atmosphere with the lights, DJ, fun drinks and big TVs. The food is tasty especially when you're pregaming. Cons are the service is sometimes very spotty and the food is a little pricey for what it is.The food is not bad. Got the fried chicken (soy garlic, original and spicy) and both are good but soy garlic is my favorite here. The dumpling hot pot was good too, but for $30 it's a stretch for it being mostly ramen and veggies. It's fun to share but definitely not filling for more than 2 people. The watermelon soju is fun and it comes with cotton candy. The watermelon is a good size too but the actual drink was not strong at all. The yogurt soju was tasty but the melona soju was the best drink here. Half of the cup was straight soju so it's pretty strong and once the melona pop melts it's very tasty.I've been here once on a busy weekend night and once on a weekday during dinner time. Service was very spotty during the weekend. We could barely flag down our server and one of our dishes never came out.

She had seen it featured on Guy Fieri's show. He sure got it right this time! We started with the bruschetta and the calamari. The calamari was outstanding - not overly battered and I love when it comes with pepperoncini rings. They accommodated is and brought a side of tomato sauce for dipping. They could've been a bit crispier but overall delicious. The bruschetta was also well done - bread was sliced thick and nicely toasted and the tomato dressing on top was fresh. For dinner I ordered the lobster ravioli which was out of this world. They do not skimp on the lobster in this dish. The pasta itself was sturdy and tasty and the tomato cream sauce it was in was not too heavy and had great flavor. The portion was generous - definitely a standout. My father ordered the eggplant parm over the house made rigatoni and that was incredible. The eggplant was sliced thin, roasted to perfection and only light breaded. Moderate cheese topping - enough to provide the creaminess without overwhelming. And the house made rigatoni was remarkable. I kept picking noodles off his plate - I've never had better pasta. I also tried a bit of the gnocchi that my brother ordered on the side of his veal parm. It was good but the sauce it was served in didn't have enough flavor. It could've used a more robust marinara sauce in my opinion. My mom ordered the bolognese sauce which I haven't tried yet but I plan to tomorrow.We also shared a bottle of the Sangiovese blend. Once aerated a bit, the flavors opened nicely and it was a smooth, drinkable wine and paired nicely with our meal. Prices were more than reasonable considering the quality of food and size of the portions. Highly recommend this place, but the seating is limited! It's a very small place and they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. We were all impressed and it was a great reunion for my family and my teacher.

Â Everything is stated to be homemade and made-to-order.We came here for an early dinner, and we ordered: the Lobster Ravioli (literally, small fish-sized ravioli, jam-packed with ricotta, and tossed in a red cream sauce with tons of lobster meat; the sauce was just okay, and I didn't get what most people described as the taste being creamy and tangy; while the ravioli was massive, it seemed to be needed to be drained more, as it was a little watery inside; I did appreciate the abundance of the large chunks of lobster meat, which seems to match the price of the dish) and the Vongole (homemade linguini, garlic, extra virgini olive oil, clams, and finished with red or white sauce; we opted for the red; lots of clam, set on top of the dish, and they all were cleaned properly and tasted fresh; the linguini was cooked al dente, and the sauce tasted homemade.Just note that there is a note at the bottom of the menu where dishes cannot be split/shared, so each party will need to order their own dish. Â We got there early enough where there was no wait (very surprised, as I had heard that usually there is a long line!) and were seated right away.

You can have boxed penne anytime at home or anywhere else. Get their homemade pasta - whether it's gnocchi or ravioli or fusili or whatever......just get it. Everything is SO delicious. The sauces, the meats, the pasta. SO DAMN GOOD. The other thing to note are the portion sizes. Each bowl/plate of pasta feeds any army (ok more like 3 people, but still). There were 4 people in my party and we made the mistake of each ordering a dish. Wrong move. We should've ordered 2 pastas and maybe an appetizer. It wouldn't have been a problem if we lived there and take home leftovers (which, if that's what you're going to do then by all means) but we were catching a flight so we had to let a lot of food go to waste.

Â Expect all the group reservations to be sold out within an hour, and possibly much quicker.I celebrated my birthday here a couple of years ago, and I made the reservation myself. Â As it turned out, rather inconveniently, I was sitting in an airport bar waiting for my flight to board when the phone line opened up. Â So a friend and I simultaneously speed dialed Rino's over and over and over, I'm guessing ~120 times over 10 minutes between the two of us, until we got lucky and grabbed one of the last remaining reservations. Â LOL, if you are motivated enough, it's really not that hard!2) Alternatively, you can wait in line outside the restaurant. Â Of course, you might be waiting 2-3 hours before they call to say your table is ready. Â As you can see from other Yelp reviews, sometimes you might not even get in!If you try this approach, take my advice and bring along a couple of bottles of wine. Â While Rino's won't let you drink them, if you get tired of waiting in line, you can head across the street to 300 Saratoga Cafe, which just happens to be Boston's only LEGAL byob restaurant (also Italian).yelp.com/biz/300-saratogâ€_3) Finally, try going for a late mid-week lunch. Â At 1:50PM on a very cold and blustery day in April (so perhaps everyone stayed home), we walked right in to a half-full restaurant.Personally, while Rino's serves well-made, fresh and tasty ""red sauce"" Italian-style cooking, there's no way I'm waiting 2+ hours in line for it.Street parking can be a challenge. Â But it's only a 10-15 minute Uber ride from the North End.Good luck!",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"665,5,"Finally I can take this place off my bookmark list! Â I think was on there about 3 years. Â My first attempt at Rino's was a bust as they don't take reservations and it was a 2 hour wait. Â  Obviously coming at 6:30pm on a Friday night is pointless, so save yourself the trip.This attempt was better thought out. Â Monday at 4pm. Â As soon as they opened. Â I barely ate all day in anticipation. Â  My friend and I got a table but by 4:30 they were packed. Â  Although they are known for their lobster ravioli, I was really in the mood for chicken parm, so that's what I ordered. Â I've had it at numerous places and it's always a classic. Â It's kind of the staple I use to compare who makes it best. Â  Â My friend got the Fruti De Mare.Holy cow was it good! Â Not only was it a huge portion but the flavor was outstanding! Â Probably the best I've ever had. Â That food is definitely made with love because each bite made me feel better about my life. Â  The chicken was crispy yet tender, the sauce was hearty and tangy, and the cheese was perfectly melted. Â Served over some homemade pasta made this an absolute delight.I tried my friends enormous plate of seafood and it was also delicious. Â The red sauce completely made the dish.Very friendly servers and a decent selection of wine just completed this wonderful experience. Â  Getting a table takes a bit of strategic planning, but I assure it is well worth it. Â  Â I will be going back to try the ravioli.",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"666,5,"My husband and I were visiting Boston this past weekend. A friend of mine who lives in the area recommended Rino's Place. She suggested we get there early. We arrived right before 5:00 on a Friday night. There was no wait. The restaurant is small maybe 10 tables. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, my husband ordered the Veal Parmesan and I had the rigatoni pasta with meatballs. This is Italian at its finest. My pasta serving was so big I probably only ate about a 1/3 of it. My husband cleaned his plate and said it was the best veal he'd ever eaten. By the time we left the place was packed and there was a line on the street. Definitely seems to be a locals favorite and I can see why. Fantastic food and service!!",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"667,5,"I had this place on my go-to list ever since I saw it on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives years ago. Â Finally had the opportunity to go and boy it did not disappoint. Â Now the first thing you should know that on weekends this place will be absolutely slammed during the usual lunch and dinner rush. Â There's no reservations unless you have a party larger than 6 so unless you want to brave the long lines I advise to come during a non peak time (I went at 5pm on a Tuesday and it was pretty open). Â Parking is limited to street (2 hour time limit unless you have resident stickers though there's no meters you need to worry about). Â Started off with the calamari which had a good balance of salt and spice. Â Very crispy but not too greasy and heavy. Â The bread that came with the meal was nothing special (some oil and Parmesan would have been nice but not a big deal). Â Salad was a nice prelude to the main meal. Â The lady had her go-to entree of the Frutti di Mare with linguine pasta and was very happy with the combination of flavors (she had the red sauce). Â The quantity was massive so she wrapped the remaining quarter as leftovers.I went with the signature lobster ravioli which was absolutely delicious. Â It came with 8 raviolis which may not seem huge but it's absolutely packed with lobster and ricotta cheese. Â It's quite dense so don't get caught off guard since I barely managed to finish the meal and felt bottom heavy for quite a while afterwards. The prices are a tad on the high side but they make up for it in terms of quality AND quantity. Â We'll definitely be back in the future to try their other offerings!",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"668,4,"My Italian sister from another mister told me one day ""I really want Rino's!"" And so we came to Rino's for dinner. They claim they are ""The Best Italian Food In Town."" And the conclusion.. THEY ARE! As we were waiting in line, there wasn't one person who didn't tell me I won't be disappointed, it's worth the wait, or you'll love it and you'll come back time after time. Even restauranteurs in the North End would come here and the North End has how many Italian restaurants to choose from? Now I've been to Italy and had real deal Italian food, so if I had a nonna, I think she'd approve of Rino's. I truly found the food extremely delicious and authentic. All the food is cooked to order, the portions are insanely huge so expect to doggie bag lots of leftovers.My biggest and only compliant which I had to dock a star for; the wait is miserable and they don't take reservations. My friend told me we needed to get there before it opens and she wasn't kidding. We got there on a Saturday at 330 pm and had to wait up to 2 hours to get a table. On the weekend they open at 3 pm, so can you imagine? However, if you come to Rino's you'll see because the food is ""that"" good, people would wait as long as needed in the cold or even in the heat for it. The food speaks for itself and tells you a lot about this hole in the wall. I agree and think Rino's is hands down the best Italian in town and nothing compares. Just bring your patience and prepare yourself for a long wait before getting seated, if not take out is an option.",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"669,3,"Had a co-worker visiting from CA, and he wanted to try this place out--was recommended. Â Very small place, seating is cozy. Â There on a Monday night and there was a good crowd, and we still got seated promptly. Service was very good, great personality and were excellent describing the food. Â This place was featured on Guy Fierri's Diners, Drive In's and Dives. Â Portions were huge and food was good. Â Recommend sharing a plate, as you won't be able to eat all the food on the plate--this could have fed a small village.",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"670,5,"So about 4:00 we were discussing what we should get for dinner. Â Somehow, Rino's was mentioned, and then so was the usual line and one hour wait since they do not take reservations. It's 100 percent first come first serve (I'm not positive but I think they will accept reservations for parties of 6+). Â I said let me give them a call and see how long the wait is. I was surprised when the girl on the other end of the phone said there were 2 empty tables. Â Needless to say we took off like Speed Racer, I think we arrived in under 10 minutes. Â The food Gods were on our side, just as we got comfy at the last table the infamous waiting line started to form. Â We beat the crowd by about three minutes. Â If you have never been here, I suggest to order drinks and an appetizer while you try to decide what you want. Â The reason for this you may ask??? EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS FABULOUS. Â The menu is quite large and they always have an additional page of specials. Choices, Choices, Choices. We ordered a round of beers and some Calamari to hold us over until we could decide. Â Finally we made our choices and awaited the Bounty.The first selection to arrive at the table was the Grilled octopus served over Cannellini bean salad. Â WOW!! Â THIS WAS THE BEST OCTOPUS I HAVE EVER EATEN. Â It was cooked to perfection. Â It was soft, not a bit chewy, it actually melted in your mouth. Â And the spices, AMAZING!! The Cannellini Beans were good, but the Octopus was definitely the star . $14.00The first entrÃ©e to be placed on the table was the Veal Parmiggiana. There were two large pieces of Veal pan fried and panko crusted topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese baked and served over HOMEMADE RIGATONI. This is a killer dish! The veal was tender and perfectly seasoned. The rigatoni were cooked al dente, OH Boy!! How Delicious. Â $20.00Then the Ribeye was brought over, My God! What a steak!! It was cooked perfectly and the spices Unbelievable! This Ribeye would challenge the best steak in Boston for only $30.00 and it's served with Asparagus and 3 potato Crochets. Who would guess the best steak in town is at an Italian joint not a steak house?? I'll definitely be going back again to fill my Ribeye void. I would have loved to see the desert menu, but needless to say, we were stuffed. However a double espresso was forced down.. It was a great blend. I give Rino's a Solid 5 Stars",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"671,5,"Yes, Rino's is tiny. No, they do not take reservations. Yes, the bathroom is located through the crazy kitchen. Yes, you will have to wait. Yes, the staff has some flare. Who. Gives. A. Sh*t. Rino's is the best old-school, red sauce, Italian-American restaurant I've ever been to. Never have I experienced a restaurant that was able to meet such exorbitant hype, until I dined at Rino's.The lobster ravioli here is no joke - hands down the best I've ever had. The sauce was clearly reinforced with either lobster or clam or some sort of seafood stock. The pasta was homemade. And the lobster was plentiful. My buddy shared a bite of his veal parm with me, which was also divine. It came on the bone still, which I've never seen before. They butterflied it and then pounded it out, so it was perfectly tender and not overcooked, so it was still juicy. The red sauce was also absolutely textbook.Check your high horse on the curb and venture to Eastie to experience Rino's. Or don't, so that way I can manage to get a table.",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"672,4,We were staying at the town place suites near airport and wanted someplace close for dinnerSaw it had great reviews and we are big Italian food fans.

The lobster ravioli was exceptional. Only problem with it was there was too much, I wanted to eat it all. The sauce was very good too. They definitely didn't skip out on the lobster either.

I made a good choice with the creamy Italian.",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"674,5,"This is exactly the kind of no-frills, homestyle Italian restaurant that I PINED for during my 6 years living in Texas. I came to Rino's with a group of friends and started out with a plate of calamari (absolute perfection) and a seafood special appetizer (a baby octopus dish that was super tasty.) I kept it simple for my entree and ordered linguini and clams in red sauce because I was so excited to just appreciate having actual homemade pasta for the first time in forever, and it did not disappoint. Scratch that- it was everything I hoped it would be and more. I absolutely cannot wait to keep coming back here and work my way through the menu!",Rino's Place,"258 Saratoga St Boston, MA 02128"675,5,"This is the epitome of a 5 star restaurant. Â I have to admit I was skeptical at first. The restaurant is in the basement level of a building and about a 5 minute walk away from the busy hub of North End restaurants on Hanover St. When I walked in, I felt like I was under the sea. The restaurant gave off a cool yet sophisticated vibe, with light that cast an ocean blue hue in some areas.Our server, Adam, was attentive, pleasant and calm. I couldn't have asked for better service. The food was excellent. One of the best we've ever had. 2 people in our party ordered the daily pasta with lobster, mushrooms and truffle butter. I had a little taste of this dish. Â If they have this on the menu, GET THIS. You can taste that the pasta is freshly made. The truffle butter, mushrooms and all of the flavors come together very nicely. You can taste the freshness of the the lobster tail. Â I ordered the spaghetti with clams with white wine garlic sauce. The clams and sauce had layers of flavor and the pasta tasted fresh.I considered knocking down a star though, because I can taste some sand/grit from the clams. For now, I'm leaving my rating at 5 stars because everything else was so good. Â  Â  Â  There is no kid's menu but they were able to accommodate with variations of adult dishes to make it kid friendly and size appropriate. We ordered a chicken cutlet and a pasta with bolognese sauce. The chicken cutlet was perfectly breaded and fried. Even though it was the thinnest chicken cutlet I've seen, it was not at all dried out. The portion size was very large and could easily feed an adult. My daughter who doesn't usually like meat, shared some of this and loved it. The spaghetti with bolognese sauce was very flavorful too. Â The sauce is thick and delicious. My daughter, who is very particular about pasta sauces and what's in it, raved about this dish. The portion size was generous for a kid's portion and was enough for me to have a taste. The bread, unfortunately was cold. It had good texture though and the delicious truffle butter makes up for any of its shortcomings.This place was all around excellent: service, ambience, food. It was pricey but reasonable for what you get.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"676,4,"Dinner with colleagues this evening, we were a little concerned about the basement setup as we walked in but it all got better when we were seated at a nice table with comfy seats and white table cloth. The young lady who served us was pleasant and smiling the entire time.The filet looked great, served with fries. I've never seen a steak plated like this - bone-in and served vertically. A good cut but not nearly enough meat on there for a full meal. Filet cut, so there's that.I chose the seafood stew and it was excellent. A large portion of salmon, shrimps, scallops, clams, mussels and underneath, a huge hunk of crab still in the shell. All of that served on top of a tomato risotto that somehow didn't splash everywhere. Very tasty and enjoyable, though ending with the crab and having to crack it after it was covered in tomato-ey juiciness was odd.A very nice meal and thoroughly enjoyed. Not quite perfect but very, very good.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"677,4,"I think this place was pretty good for their oysters. The service was pretty good, even though our server seemed a bit out of it. They definitely work as a team in their Restaurant. When our server was missing, the manager came by to ask us if we wanted another glass of wine. My husband ordered the bone in filet mignon , which was excellent. He normally doesn't like a lean steak, but that was his only choice at this place and he loved it. I liked their east-coast oysters and grilled octopus.",il Molo,"326 Commercial St Boston, MA 02109"678,3,"Il Molo could improve. Â Some things that I noted: Â Have two two small separate spoons for mignonette sauce and cocktail sauce of oysters. Â Having one led to a muddling of flavors. Â Also, Â the pasta for the special was undercooked, while the tomato sauce was so watery that I was left with dry chewy pasta. Â Not luscious or flavorful..

We ordered scallops, oysters, lobster and pasta. Everything was fresh and delicious. The decor was perfect for our date night and the service was great.

Â *Cue the violins* Â But as they say, good (or in this case, great!) things come to those who are patient. Â Fast forward to Sept 2017, I finally found myself dining here for a surprise engagement party and nothing was spared. Â Now, let's get on to the food!Per our usual, we engulfed our tables with an entire menu's worth of apps x 2. Â It's hard to choose only a few favorites but if you're stuck, you can't go wrong with the octopus, lobster crab cakes or the shellfish tower. Â The carnivores in our party also salivated over the steak tartare. Â The octopus had a nice mesquite flavoring but it was also the most softest piece of octopus I've ever had. Â This is coming from someone who had grilled octopus every other day when in Greece. Â The crab cakes were super fresh and had a very generous crab to breading ratio and finally, for the indecisive, the shellfish tower is a must. Â The raw bar was exquisite and the crudo of the day was exceptional which happened to be salmon that day; Great mix with a little bit of everything. Â The calamari and the mussels were solid choices but more traditionally prepared. For entrees, I had the pleasure of indulging in the swordfish, the daily pasta with lobster, mushrooms and truffle butter and the il Molo Polo. Â All tasted wonderful and were prepared perfectly. Â I highly recommend the swordfish for something lighter. It was so moist, not dry and stringy as it can sometimes be when it gets overcooked and the daily pasta with lobster over the Il Molo Polo for those that aren't afraid of a little carb coma after. Â Promise you it will be well worth it! Â All in all, it was a perfect evening. Â The food was superb and the service team was engaging, friendly and helpful.

They gave us the private dining room and made the room work for our party. Â The staff was friendly and patient. Â We practically ordered most items off the menu. Â Items such as the following: raw bar, octopus, beef tartare, calamari, fried clams, crabcakes....and that was just the appetizer round.

We stared at the two gentlemen inside and one looked down while the other looked at us and talked to the other man. The restaurant should've been opened at least an hour by this point.

Definitely not my favorite restaurant while visiting Boston.,Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"699,4,We stopped here before leaving for Logan. Great sandwiches and good service. Found a sandwich with my name but decided on the lobster roll.,Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"700,3,"Overall: Just an A-OK experience that both satisfies and disappoints in different ways. Hopefully it was just an ""off day"".The good: The meatloaf main dish that we got was surprisingly tasty and was enough to split between the both of us, and the same can be said for the nicoise salad. Both were hearty and flavorful in their own way. The menu is quite large, especially the amount of sandwiches they had, which seems to be their expertise (we weren't in the mood). The not-so-good: Service was pretty unattentive, uninviting, and awkward. We had to flag them down for pretty much every portion of the meal experience. No mentions of specials, favorites, or anything at all. The food was also a bit over-priced and not very enthusiastically plated (somewhat sloppy)Atmosphere: 7/10Service: 5.5/10Food: 7.5/10",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"701,4,"Stopped in with a colleague at lunch time and wow, this place was slammed. Twenty minute wait but organized well by the host.We had a small two-top table in a corner, so we ate side-by-side.Lots of different sandwiches on the menu and my eye landed on the Mexican Meatball. It arrived not long after. A reasonable portion of meatballs on a toasted sub melted pepper jack cheese, tomato and lettuce. A small salad on the side and a pot of au jus for dipping.I'd return to Parish. Maybe not during the lunch rush.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"702,3,"Decent place for sandwiches, but really nothing that had a wow factor. My friend and I came on a Sunday right at noon and were one of the first few customers. Service is super fast and before we knew it, we had pipin' hot sandwiches in front of us. I got the Bravas sandwich because I'm a sucker for prosciutto and chorizo, but the overall sandwich was wayyyy too salty. The meat was more like overly preserved/salted salami and at one point, I actually had to pick out some of the meat so that I could actually eat the sandwich without tearing up from the intense sodium level. My friend ordered the Eggplant Milanesa; it was good, but nothing really amazing. It had a much more mushy texture overall and as much as I love avocados, they really didn't help with improving the texture of the sandwich. Overall - the portions are decent with a generous helping of potato salad / cole slaw. But the sandwiches were short of amazing and were just passable.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"703,4,"Very fun sandwich shop in Boston that collects (with permission!) the famous sandwiches of other local restaurants. I had the Bravas, a tapas-inspired chorizo sandwich. It was great - a little heat and a lot of flavor. The potato salad it came with was a little boring, but it did a nice job of cooling the heat from the sandwich. They managed to seat a large group at lunchtime with a fairly minimal wait, although service sometimes lagged (I had to ask multiple times to get my water glass refilled). That said, it's a very convenient location and it's a cool way to experience many different local specialties if you don't have long in Boston. Worth a visit if you're already in the neighborhood and looking for a lunch option.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"704,4,"Found this place through Yelp while looking for somewhere to go for brunch. I think the concept is really cool, having dishes from restaurants in the area. I haven't had a particular dish in the restaurant where it's really from and then from Parish, so I can't tell if the execution is any good.In other aspects, staff was friendly, space is pretty big, lots of room for big tables (I think there was a table of maybe 20 right behind mine). I got the Parish chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the hot and cold chicken salad. I really enjoyed mine and near the end, actually stopped eating because there was just too much chicken, it was so thick. I think I was supposed to have an option between potato salad and cole slaw but the waitress didn't asked me and instead I got both, albeit a smaller portion of each. I really liked the potato salad and thought the cole slaw was tasty too. The pickles were interesting. I'm not sure what I think of them. Boyfriend enjoyed his salad as well but he usually says that for most things!It was hard to me to find things I liked on the menu so may not come back again but I think it's a great concept!",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"705,5,"We came into town late evening traveling from central New York. In town for our son's graduation from Northeastern University. He took us here and we were not disappointed. I am currently in the midst of the Whole Life Challenge (performance level-no cheese no added sugars; watching for some preservatives, no breads or pastas , etc) so dining out is always a chore. I do not readily eat out while I dm on this challenge (saves health and my pocketbook!) but since we were traveling I knew I had no choice. I knew I was not going to be perfect (WLC is not about that anyway!) but I always try to study the menu trying to give it my best shot of eating highly fresh, low sugary foods without no bread/ pastas. I usually get a burger, hold the cheese, push the bun aside and substitute a salad or veggie instead of friesThis establishment had the most perfect delicious choice! (see photo/ i had to take a pic of the paper menu because I did not see it on their digital menu). In this salad I asked for the cheese to be left off and to add cold cut chicken. ""No problem"" our waitress said ( I am sure we were charged for adding the chicken but I did not see bill before my husband paid it) I love when staff can be so amenable to food substitutions. Easy peasy. Now, with a salad, most restaurants will add delicious, sugary, dressing, but not this one. The lemon ""vinaigrette"" was more like light olive oil and lemon Â --all fresh and light tasting. The peas, ginger, mint and mesclun mix had these small blasts of flavor. It was awesome. And the pieces of chicken were fresh, no added sugar sauce added. A moderate amount so this dish is not for big eaters. Perfect for me. I am a less is more gal. Â So if you are looking for a light, very healthy, non-dairy low-carb delicious dish--this is it! It is a great example how good a dish can be, prepared with balancing all ingredients well without resorting to sweet sauces. Bravo!",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"706,5,"I love everything about this place. 1. The food is great, creative, and changes at a reasonable pace. 2. It's fun and great for friends meeting for drinks or a first date. 3. The service is solid and the place is well priced, especially so close to Newbury and the Common. 4. In the Spring/Summer, it has a great outdoor patio. Lastly, the pitcher of Sangria was $32, delicious and equated to 6-7 glasses amongst the group. I return here every few months, always happy to come back for another visit.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"707,5,"Amazing choice of sandwiches and all of them have a unique taste! Being a vegetarian my family and I are not left with a lot of options, but this was a fair deal. I ordered the Eggplant Milanesa (soo delicious and flavorful). My brother ordered The Alden (was good but not as good as eggplant milanesa) all though he did not like it so much. He said the sour and spicy flavor was overpowering for his taste. And don't miss out on the white sangrias! Super delicious and another favorite if you're a whiskey lover was Employees Only.

Menu has an array of sandwiches created by chefs from all over the country along with a smaller menu of salads, entrees and appetizers. But the sandwich menu is the star here. We had the Zuni Roll and it was fantastic. Â Potato salad was amazing as well. Good sized portions so if you're just looking for a small bite, sharing is definitely a good idea. Friendly staff. European vibe and large bar seating area.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"710,4,"We were spending the afternoon in the city of Boston and wanted to stop at a place to grab lunch. After checking Yelp, we came across a few sandwich shops and The Parish Cafe struck our interest from the reviews. When we entered the cafe, they were pretty busy and the seating was limited. Therefore, we checked in with the hostess and were informed that the wait would be about 15-20 minutes. We decided to stay and wait since it was likely that other places were just as busy. They were consistently busy with people coming in behind us as we waited. This is something to keep in mind if you're looking for a grab-and-go place place to eat. Once we were seated, we waited a few minutes before the server took our drink order. They have a full bar, beers on draft and in bottle, and they have wine. Some of the options they had on draft were impressive. It was really hard to figure out what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu sounded delicious. You can see the chefs making the sandwiches in the kitchen which helped give us an idea of what looked good. I also checked photos on Yelp to see some of the favorites or commonly ordered sandwiches. Since we ultimately couldn't make up our minds, we each ordered different sandwiches (which would allow us to try more than one).After we ordered, the food was served shortly after. The sandwiches were DELICIOUS. I ordered the Bravas sandwich that came with a side of potato salad. Others in my party ordered the Le Mistral, The Bondir Brisket, and the Steak and Blue. My favorite of all was the Bondir Brisket. SO yummy. You can see their standard sandwiches on their website. They do have specials in house, too. (parishcafe.com/boylston/â€_ )I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food. It is a bit on the pricier end; however, that is typically expected for a fancier, specialty sandwich shop.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"711,5,"Delish.Onion rings were perfect.

The outdoor patio was great on a July evening.Everything we tried was great.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"712,5,"Arrived in Boston early one afternoon and wanted to eat somewhere casual near my hotel. The concierge suggested this place for a casual situation.One of my students and I arrived around 2 p.m. It was a Friday, so I thought it might have been a bit more crowded but we were able to get a table outside, which was nice. This was before Boston got too cold to function in. So, we ordered our first adult beverage of the day. A little pricey but what did I expect?We were STARVING since we just got off of a plane. So, we decided to start with the ""Hummus Platter."" We loved it. Mix of healthy and salty favorites. Enjoyed every second of it.Then, we ordered our meals. My student got the Nicoise Salad. She said it wasn't great. I ordered something completely on the opposite of the health spectrum. I went with the ""Hot and Dirty Pig Burger."" Very YUMMY and extremely SPICY--- exactly what this Texas girl was looking for. It was huge, though, so I ended up not eating the entire bun. Overall, I really liked it, though. Just think, bacon, peppers, red onion and more. Interesting that this restaurant takes meals created by chefs at other restaurants and adds them to the menu. I didn't get the story on this but would be interested to know why.Our server was perfectly nice, although I did have to ask for my water to be refilled. That is one of my flat-out restaurant pet peeves. Just after the checks came and we paid, the sky opened up and began raining. While everyone ran inside, we ran off to our next destination, happy and full!",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"713,5,The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The servers were super friendly as well. I got the hot and cold chicken salad with arugula which was really good. I liked that they added rice into the dish Â which made it more filling. We also tried the mac and cheese (really flavorful) and The Bravas sandwich. Topped it off with the white chocolate bread pudding which was piping hot and scrumptious.,Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"714,4,"Came here on a busy Saturday brunch time. Got a corner window seat in 15 minutes (just a party of two) but the patio had an hour long wait! Our server was clearly flustered since it seems like they were a little short on staff.My companion and I ordered a half order of Bowl-O-Rings ($5.50) to start and it was absolutely amazing. Sweet onions encased by a crispy beer batter had us reeling for more! In fact that half portion was big enough to fill us up quite a bit before our entrees came. Honestly, all of the sandwiches sounded good on the menu. It was SO DIFFICULT trying to decide on one especially with all the good reviews! I figured since it's my first visit I'll go with their signature sandwich - the Parish Chicken Sandwich ($12.75) with baked buttermilk chicken cutlet, on a deluxe roll with romaine, tomato, cheddar, bacon, pickles, side of chipotle aioli. I took the potato salad option. I found the chicken cutlet to be a little on the bland side, and it was a little difficult to eat as a sandwich. The pickles added a nice tang. I wish the aioli was spread on the bun instead of on the side. The potato salad on the side however, was divine!Le Mistral ($20.50) is another popular choice here, and I can see why. The sandwich was huge, and had a lot of premium ingredients in it - garlic and rosemary marinated beef tenderloin, on ciabatta with caramelized onions, chive mashed potatoes, melted Bel Paese cheese, arugula, truffle aioli, crispy onions. My only qualm would be that the beef slices inside were a little tough and difficult to chew on. Flavor was great though!Will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches.",Parish Cafe and Bar,"361 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"715,4,"I really liked Mooo, the space itself is fairly large so they manage to fill a lot of space without it feeling cramped. The staff went above and beyond my expectations - seriously the best service at any restaurant I've received in a long time. I don't have any real complaints except the food was just good. For the price and all the talk about this place I was expecting the best steak I've ever had in my life...my steak was delicious, but not AMAZING and that's why I can't give Mooo 5 stars.I will definitely be coming back here because I did have a really great experience, but I'm still on the hunt for the best steak in Boston.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"716,3,"When we travel with our friends - we always have a bit of a competition on who can pick the best restaurant.

Â Beef Wellington was full of flavor and the hit of the night2. Â Wagyu Dumplings were delicate and tasty3. Â Truffle fries were a hit4. Â Chocolate cake was rich and moist but could have used more vanilla ice cream.Here was what lacked:1. Â The $65 bone in ribeye was thin cut (despite 22oz) and was more like a Longhorn steak than a prime steakhouse.2. Â The filet, although cooked med rare, was dry and tasteless3. Â The escargot was unpalatable.4. Â The potato skins were a disaster of mashed potatoes on a skin5.

Walking into the restaurant it smells of wet barn/mold that quickly made me lose my appetite. I had salmon with eggs --that was nothing to write home about. At least the English muffin was good with their excellent butter. I wanted to try dinner since everyone raves about the steak here. But after 2 breakfast attempts, I still couldn't get over the smell. The front of the restaurant near the street does not smell as bad. And the bar is excellent.

Â The cheese sauce is rich and flavorful, almost like a bisque.2. The Tuna Soba Noodle Salad - Sushi-grade seared tuna over greens, chilled soba noodles, sesame seeds and an asian dressing. Â 3.

Lobster Bisque - A must in Boston",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"720,3,"This is a hard review to write. There was so much right about this place. And despite what happened I think I would go again. We had the carpaccio and wagyu beef dumplings as a starter and then had a rib eye each. With a cauliflower side. Had Australian Shiraz, the moolydooker which I already knew was superb. Steak was great carpaccio fantastic. Can complain. Issue comes with the dumplings... honestly the person who recommended me come here specifically said to get them. But, first bite. A little bit chewy I was thinking. Yup because there is plastic wrapping in the meat. Strange because that would indicate they aren't wagyu maybe, and obviously not good to have the plastic in there in the first place. This is where I get a little funny about it. I am not one to complain, so I called the waiter over and he had it replaced. They didn't charge me for the dumplings. But - I would just expect something complimentary. They charged for everything else. Then obviously I didn't tip hugely, because of that, then I got attitude. I was disappointed. I would go back and give it another go, it is highly rated but overall 3 stars is a fair assement given it would have been a 4.5 in normal circumstances. I left with a bad taste in my mouth.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"721,5,"Mooo is fantastic. Service was impeccable and they anticipated all of our needs. Easy to get to location, between the green and red lines. I especially like that the restaurant has a separate entrance from the hotel so that it doesn't feel like a ""hotel's restaurant."" You don't have to walk through a lobby, pass dozens of tourists, or take an elevator to a different floor with kids. We had the east coast oysters, lobster mac and cheese, escargot, and ribeye. Cocktails were well made. All of the food was exactly as we wanted it. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, and did a good job describing how the different steaks differ. The menu is large but not overwhelming. There is an excellent wine selection and you can host private parties in their wine cellar downstairs. We were there at 6pm on a Saturday and had a lot of privacy in our corner of the restaurant; it wasn't overwhelmingly busy. We'll be back to try more in the future. We'd come back for the bread alone.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"722,4,"This place is so close to get a 5 star but with the price tag, I expected a perfect experience with get 5 star. Parking wasn't an issue, even on Sunday dinner? There are plenty street parking close by. The place was dark, it was so hard to see the food. The table was so close to each other, you can hear the next table's conversation. We got a menu that says ""Happy Birthday"" on top, which was cute. The server is professional and knowledgable. You definitely needs his help finding the right steak because the menu isn't descriptive, Australian vs Omaha vs Steak frites, yet a huge difference in prices. Dinner was started with dinner rolls and butter. They kept the rolls warm by brushing with melt butter on top of a cast iron plate. It was buttery and delicious. Then we shared Lobster Bisque for appetizer. The split the soup for us and it come with beautiful presentation. The bisque was delicious and filled with pieces of lobster. We had lobster bisque at many places and this is the place that actually put many chunks of lobsters in the soup.We ordered the Australian Ribeye with Truffle Parmersan Fries for entree (entree doesn't come with side, only comes with bome marrow butter). Perfectly cooked, especially tasty when you get to put the bone marrow butter on top. The fries was a little small but crispy, and very delicious. We was full after the steak so we didn't get desserts but they give us complementary chocolate dipped marshmallow, which was very good.The staff was attentive and constantly filled our water, which is a good thing. Because what knocked one star out of the review was the salt. There Â was coarse salt on top of the rolls, salty lobster bisque, and salty steak. I love my salt , yet it was salty even for me, and my husband agreed. I would totally comes again due to the great service and food but probably asked for less salt next time.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"723,5,"I'd definitely go here again. Everything was SO good! Â Loved the drinks. Loved everything really. Â  Very dark, cool ambiance inside. Very cool decor. Â Loved the cow pics hanging up. Â The lobster mac was delicious.

We ordered half dozen oysters and it was so fresh and the Lobster Mac is to DIE FOR. I had the filet mignon and it was like butter. For dessert we ordered the banana foster and they wrote happy anniversary on the plate. It was really cute and I really enjoyed eating here. For the price I would definitely say it is worth it.For parking expect to do valet because you would not be able to find street parking at all.,Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"725,5,"This review is special for a few reasons. This is my 400th review, I write to not only to inform but to also write about a piece of my life in writing. Located in Beacon Hill, you could throw a rock from the State House and hit Mooo. Driving and parking is a challenge but when you're in Boston, that is par for the course (especially in this neighborhood).We arrived approximately 10 minutes early for our reservation, and we were taken in right away to our table. We were able to check our coats with the hostess, no charge.The atmosphere is dim, intimate, and comfortable. We were seated near the entrance in a shared booth seat for two tables. A couple sat across from us. I loved the throw pillows with the cow-fur on them, it was a nice little touch.We started by ordering drinks. My wife had a couple of glasses of Inniskillin Vidal; it was a decadent ice wine that had a profound flavor of raisins to it, touch of vanilla, and notes of cherries to it. I wish I could have enjoyed a glass but this was pricey and I came for the food, not the wine. My wife, the opposite. I ordered CVNE ViÃ±a Real. It was a mellow crianza (my first), with flavors of cherries and cranberries. It wasn't particularly best paired for steak because it was a flat flavor and not particularly robust.So many things to choose from. I have had carpaccio and escargot. One thing I have not tried before was the bone marrow. Ordering this I knew I would be on my own. The plate is a beautiful presentation with the bone marrow served in the bones with pieces of toast. The bones are served on a mound of salt in a cast iron dish with a wooden cradle for carrying/moving. A side of gravy and roasted garlic in their bunch is served with the marrow. The marrow looks like grissel, but melts in your mouth and presents a rich, fatty flavor.Of course when I saw this placed on the table across from us with the couple who had arrived and not ordered yet, I was confused. Then, amused at the mistake as the server was explaining the dish and the couple were looking confused. Our server came over and apologized after removing the dish from their table. He was kind of sassy about the guy that delivered the food. ""He's only been here a year, he's still learning the tables I guess."" Drama in the kitchen, shots fired! My wife yelled at me for enjoying the petite drama. Overall, no biggie.After eating the bone marrow appetizer, I didn't have much room for anything else. So, the filet mignon at 8 ounces was a rational choice. Ordering medium rare, it was absolutely exquisite. The flavor of the meat was mellow, just the slightest seasoning. I didn't want sauce, I wanted to enjoy the filet mignon by itself. My wife enjoyed hers but she said she was bored with it and didn't finish it, we had gotten the same thing but hers cooked medium. Opted to get the truffle fries after reading rave reviews, I didn't find them terribly impressive and could have done without them. There was something off, I really wanted to like them. Everything else was a great experience.I had mentioned about including a piece of my life in these reviews. Regarding that, my wife and I came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We have been together for 13 years, married for 4 years. I consider this a gift from her because she isn't a foody like me. This restaurant is outside our normal price range but someplace I really wanted to try, and we came here as a celebration even though this isn't her cup of tea. This was a wonderful anniversary experience, and happy anniversary to my wonderful wife.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"726,4,"Located on the ground floor of the swanky XV Beacon Hotel, Mooo is a unique steakhouse. Unique in the decor especially; it doesn't look like your typical steakhouse at all. They've opted out of the dark wood notes and instead went for white and off-white tones complimented with some dim lighting. We arrived a few minutes early for our 8:30PM reservation only to find out that we had to wait a bit. No problem, their large bar was accommodating and made waiting for our table only a minor inconvenience. Except that we waited.. and waited.. and weren't seated until 9:10PM. No real apologies and nothing from the kitchen as a nice gesture, we were seated in a completely different area of the restaurant than what I had originally planned out. Famished, we decided to just move things along.We kicked things off with an order of roasted bone marrow ($19) which the kitchen split onto two separate plates - a very nice touch on their part and one that didn't go unnoticed. The panko breadcrumbs sprinkled on top made for a nice contrast and added a bit of crunch. It was a superb start to our meal.Next came our entres, which in our case featured an 8oz filet mignon ($44) for my wife and an 18oz ribeye ($56) for me. They absolutely nailed the temp on the meat and we also had the flight of sides ($21) with our food. The flight features whipped Yukon gold potato, creamed spinach, truffled parmesan fries and exotic mushrooms. We also added sauteed onions ($6) because why the hell not. The concept of having a flight of sides is really, really awesome and they were some of the best I've had in any steakhouse. The sauteed onions were okay but the real highlights were the whipped potatoes and the creamed spinach. I was very impressed and all-in-all, our meal was stellar. Even the complimentary bread rolls which came before our bone marrow appetizer was tasty.We did however hit another inconsistency with the service which took nearly 15 minutes to bring us the check, and another 10 to come back for my card. It was kind of a bummer since they're known for their service.All in all Mooo is definitely a premier contender for being one of the best steakhouses in town. The food is scrumptious and while expensive (even for a steakhouse), it does make for a nice, occasional treat. The decor is a bit whacky but if you're willing to overlook that, it'll make way for a memorable meal and experience. We'll definitely be back and hope for slightly better service next time. Until then, I'll dream of that ribeye...",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"727,5,"My friend and I went to Mooo Restaurant during a recent trip to Boston and we are so glad we did! Every moment of our dinner was exception! Their wine selection is very impressive. Their food was delicious and perfectly cooked. For dessert, I highly suggest the Banana Foster. It's the perfect way to end the meal.The atmosphere is great as well. It's quiet but still social. It's a bit dark so taking Instagram photos isn't a prime idea. But it's a wonderful choice for a celebration or fancy date night.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"728,4,"Decided to go to Mooo as a last meal in Boston before moving. We got the heirloom tomatoes and burrata salad and the wagyu dumplings to start. The salad was essentially burrata with tomato slices, which was delicious especially with the balsamic they throw on there. The dumplings, though there were only five, were quite good. The meat inside was very tasty, and the accompanying sauce was delicious.We both got two different ribeyes. The steaks themselves were prepared and served simply, with herb butter on the side, which along with some salt and pepper were than enough. The quality of the meat was good, but they both were on the leaner side, particularly for ribeyes. Overall, for the price, I would say it was worth it.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"729,5,"Oh, this is fancy. This is a high end steak place. When they have a menu that lists FIFTEEN different steaks including origin and description, it's going to be good. And great service from the hostess, bartender, waitress and busboys. Clean, well kept and neatly uniformed. Nice.My eye was drawn to the Uruguayan ribeye. I don't know that I've ever had Uruguayan beef before. And while it was interesting, I don't know that it was any better than any other high-end ribeye I've had. The marrow butter on the side was nice, as was the raw horseradish.For side dishes, we got the broccoli which was cooked right and mixed with some red pepper flakes and pine nuts. Tasty. And the potato skins which included gruyere cheese and bacon. Yum!Very good service, a great steak, a really nice restaurant. Five stars for Mooo.",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"730,5,"Mooo - Boston , Massachusetts - 10/17/2017I'm a huge fan of Chef Jamie Mammano and the Columbus Hospitality Group having been to some of their sister restaurants; L'Andana Grille, Ostra, Mistral and recently Sorellina, Mooo has been on my radar for some time. Convenient in Boston parking via Valet or if you get here early enough, there's parking right next to the restaurant. Tonight I walk in and two of the staff recognize me from other restaurants. That's one of the things I love about being in the dining scene... At Ken's suggestion, course number one this evening... Japanese Wagyu Beef Dumplings in a Sweet Chili Soy Broth trimmed with delicately sliced Scallions... Between plating and taste, wow doesn't do it justice... It's the perfect execution of Art and Cuisine...Second course... Maine Lobstah Bisque... Brandy, Cognac served in a Butter Fleuron (essentially a really, really fancy soup bowl)... A mini Croissant floats atop a rich Broth with chunks of Lobster meat beneath... The Fleuron itself is wrapped in linen folded into a flower. Other than Table side pouring, this is one of the nicest presentations of Bisque I've ever been served...Course number three this evening...Tenderloin of Beef Wellington... Foie Gras, Spinach, Duxelle (Duxelles is a finely chopped mixture of mushrooms or mushroom stems, onions or shallots, and herbs such as thyme, parsley and black pepper, sautÃ©ed in butter and reduced to a paste~Wikipedia). I don't know if you've ever had Beef Wellington but it's an extremely difficult dish to get perfect. The Beef, a perfect warm Pink Center, sits inside a flaky Pastry Shell. When I tell you it was perfect, I mean perfect! Add to this a side of Truffles Cauliflower Gratin Parmesan Cream, Truffle Butter and Bread Crumbs... And some Roasted Fall Vegetables over Butternut Squash PurÃ©e... My palate is on sensory overload right now!And I've just been given the heads up to save room for dessert as the Chef has something special he's preparing for me...Course numbers four and five... On a rectangular plate comes out a trio surprise consisting of a CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e, mini Chocolate Cake wrapped in Chocolate Ganache and a Lemon Bomb (a frozen Lemon Mousse) Add to that an Apple Tarte with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream and my signature Cappuccino. I don't even know where to begin with describing how delicious it was... You need to experience this for yourself... I envision that this is what they serve when you get to heaven! A special thanks to Alexa the General Manager for making this a truly spectacular event. I'll be back!",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"731,5,"My roommate and I visited Mooo for the first time Tuesday for a quick bite and beverages before a concert. We ordered an espresso martini and Ugly Betty. The martini was great, but the Ugly Betty was something dreams are made of. Neither of us are big gin fans, but this drink is so tasty and well balanced, we simply could not have just one. We ordered a slew of apps in lieu of dinner. The oysters and wedge salad were fantastic, and it didn't go unnoticed that our lovely server split all the portions for us. She was wonderful and attentive. The calamari and tuna tartare were also delicious. The only item that we were not blown away by were the meatballs. They aren't bad, but definitely not show stoppers. All in all, everything was great, and we will certainly be back for entrees!",Mooo Restaurant,"15 Beacon St Boston, MA 02108"732,5,"Our visit to Mooo... was everything we wanted it to be.

Â We enjoyed a lovely New Zealand wine, the Waygu Beef dumplings appetizer were so tasty, and the Beef Wellington really is perfection [we have Beef Wellington whenever we can, Coast to Coast and MOO's really is the best we've had, including Gordon Ramsey restaurants]. The Beef Wellington is perfect because they cook the meat exactly as you ask for it and yet the pastry is perfectly cooked and browned the way it should be- further, the spinach really elevates it- it is perfect, mouth watering, tender, deliciousness.

I called Mooo to ask about takeout but no one answered the phone; I walked over to inquire and they said no problem. The total price for the organic yogurt with fresh berries and house-made granola was $19.26 not including a tip. That may seem high but this was, without a doubt, the best yogurt and granola I have ever had. The granola had PISTACHIOS in it. So good. Also, the fruit was beyond fresh- the raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries were gigantic and juicy.Service was, naturally, perfect. Both of the employees who helped me were professional and friendly. Their takeout bags are cute and they give you shiny plastic silverware to make you feel fancy.""Would you like to charge this to your room, ma'am?"" I felt like I was in ""Pretty Woman.""

My friend and I stopped by around 3PM on a Saturday (for a linner? who even knows what meals are called at that point). We wanted to try the chicken and waffles but were told that they were only served starting at 4PM, so we took a bubble tea break across the street and promptly returned.We decided to try the shojo pig baos with the chicken and waffles, and they lived up to their name. Soft and with juicy, flavorful meat, they were the perfect accompaniment to our entree. The chicken and waffles had a very aesthetically pleasing arrangement. With a honeycomb-appearing waffle that was extremely fun to eat, the dish was an experience in its own right. The (boneless!) chicken was crunchy and very subtly seasoned. The honey butter was soft and light, blending very well with the syrup they gave us. And it was quite a bit of food! We left feeling very pleasantly stuffed, with the delicious honey butter aftertaste still on our breath.Service was great, and they seem to have quite a few accolades for their fries. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is because I feel like there's room for improvement with their flavors. Either way, if you're in the mood for some yummy Asian fusion, check this place out!",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"736,5,"HOLY MOLY THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD (but kinda expensive)Just a friendly FYI, all the food here is relatively spicy (my mouth was not prepared for all that SPICE). Regardless, I absolutely loved it. The kimchi fried rice and the shadowless fries were my favorite and I would definitely recommend this to everyone!",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"737,4,"Visiting Boston just for just a couple of days. Took the T to Chinatown and found this place on Yelp for great drinks. Me and my hubby ordered a couple of rounds before going lunch somewhere else. The drinks were really good, the first one I ordered had a cucumber ice cube - like what?! Super refreshing on a flipping hot day. They had a lot of Japanese Whiskeys which my hubby loves. And Kung Fu movies behind the bar - score!",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"738,2,"The good: awesome menu, good drinks, and tasty food [once it arrives]The bad: very slow, inconsistent service; loud; and a debacle at the end where half of our late food was canceled out, leaving us hungry.This spot looked promising: Asian fusion small bites, creative cocktails, and awesome paintings all over the walls. It took a while to order, to get our drinks, and to get our food. For the items we got, most were worth the wait. I loved my Kamehameha cocktail ($11), which included chili-infused vodka, coconut milk, and citrus. It was inventive and refreshing. At the same time, it took about half an hour for my friend to get her glass of gin even after asking for it.There were some awesome food items, too. I was surprised to say I loved the mapo dofu fries the most; they're a fun rendition of the Sichuan classic. At the same time, the pork belly bao were not very flavorful. What really killed the night was that after waiting and waiting and starting to get worried about getting out in time, we asked for the check. At that point, the waiter assumed we wanted to cancel the items we had been waiting for for an hour. I could see why he might have been confused, but he should have asked. Furthermore, it means there was no idea how long it would have taken for us to get that food. Had it even been started yet?We called over the manager, who was apologetic and took 1/3 off our bill. This was a good gesture. At the same time, though, our table left still hungry and worried about being late to our show.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"739,4,"We decided to enjoy a late lunch at Shojo in Chinatown. The staff was super nice when we asked to sit at a lower table instead of the high top they showed us to. With this air cast on my foot, high tops aren't very easy!We ordered a couple of cocktails and I fell in love with the Don Papa Daquiri. The drink was light, sweet and yet still refreshing. We decided to order a bunch of dishes to share. We ordered the duck fat french fries, kimchi fried rice, pig bao, sesame charred greens, bulgogi bao, and pork belly dumplings. The kimchi rice has a great texture and isn't overly tart or hot. The duck fat french fries are hot and crispy, the dumplings were nicely done but the sauce was a little too tangy for my taste. Both of the baos were soft with tender meat and fresh toppings. The star for me was the sesame charred greens. The greens still had texture but were tender and the sauce was a great blend of savory, sweet, and nutty.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"740,4,"Would love to come back and try more of the menu, everything looked delicious.We had the blistered shishito peppers which were good but lacked seasoning. 2/3 cocktails were a hit. One was a special and not to our liking.The food was very fast to arrive once we placed our orders, but service was not the best. Lots of time spent trying to get the attention of waitstaff.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"741,5,"This place is very hip and busy. We tried their pork bun, calamari, duck fat fries, wu tang ribs, and cocktails. Everything tasted very good and fresh. This place is very loud so you want to avoid it if you need to have a deep conversation with someone though.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"742,4,"Been here a couple of times, and I keep coming back for their wu-tang tiger style ribs. Yup, they are that INCREDIBLE. Jam packed with a delicious peanut-y flavor, the meat is tender and falls right off the bone! Probably one of the best spare ribs I have ever had. That's why they are a must order whenever I'm here! I've also tried a majority of the things on their menu: the Shojonator, pork baos, kimchi fried rice, fish tacos, and the monkey chicken wings. They're all pretty good, though they don't have quite the same mind-blowing impact on me as (you guessed it) the tiger style ribs--they're the real star of the show! Keep in mind that the serving here is more tapas style, so I would say this your place to grab drinks and appetizers/light meal. This place has a hip vibe with cool wall art and poppin music, which is perfect for that chill night out. All in all, this place is solid. My friends particularly love this place so I know I'll be back!",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"743,4,"Back again since I'm back in Boston. The food never disappoints. The calamari and tiger ribs are my go-to dishes, and they were as good as ever. My wife enjoyed the basil ramen and the beef bulgogi, and she loved it. Service wasn't the best tonight. It's always a little slow at first, but this night was especially bad. Took forever to get served the first time, and the guy who finally did apparently wasn't our intended waiter. The bartender (who may also be the owner or manager) sensed our disappointment and put the first round of drinks on the house, which was very nice. Unfortunately, the service didn't improve the rest of the night. Food gets five stars, service gets a two or three. Attentive bartender/manager saves a star. Go for the fantastic food and drink. If your service suffers, can't say I didn't warn you. Hopefully it improves.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"744,3,"The waiter was really nice & helped us on ordering so got to give them props on that! I EMPHASIZE that this is definitely a more of a grab a ""snack"" & have a couple of drinks, but with me not being able to drink I stuck with the food. I got: Tori Miso Ramen, Shojonator & Grilled Kung Pao Chicken Sandwhich -ramen: most worth it for the portion/price but it was salty-shojonator: juicy/tasty, but not worth the price-Kung pao: tasty, but not worth the price I was caught off guard of the serving sizes and disappointed because I wasn't expecting it to be like snack sizes, so don't come if you're starving, but do come if you're looking for a light snack because the food is pretty good.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"745,5,Here for lunch on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

The shojonator was really good as well but it was a little small but would definitely recommend it.,Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"747,3,"Would rate this between 3 & 4 stars, but slightly closer to 3.Definitely loved the aesthetic and mood of this place. You'll notice the restaurant right away with the graffiti outside. Get there early as it gets packed! First time trying the food here, would recommend any of the specialities. A bit salty for my taste, but had some really interesting fusion flavors, very much a mix of modern and traditional. Drinks were a hit or miss, but consistently expensive. (Minus points for forgetting the flower on my drink.)At night they play Asian movies by the bar, was a nice addition. Ladies, there are hooks under the table at the bar for purses.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"748,3,"Came here twice and had good experiences overall but unsure about the food.The first time, we had a table for 6 and was waiting on 2 more for maybe about half an hour and our waiter didn't seem to mind waiting so that was definitely a good thing. Service was quick, staff was friendly and it was a good time. The table we sat at was not so good in terms of staying warm in the restaurant. There's a curtain where the main door is to prevent drafts but you can definitely feel it when the door opens and closes. It's very cold at times; especially when people keep the door open when waiting for a friend to exit. The bathroom is extremely warm, maybe because it's closer to the kitchen? When you exit the bathroom again, the restaurant temperature is really cold and you just sit there trying to not freeze for the rest of your meal. The second time, I came to celebrate a friend's 21st. We told the waiter, I think it was the same one as my first time here, and he brought over a shot in what we all thought was a teacup, which was quite odd. It apparently also turned out to be really strong and she couldn't even finish the rest of her regular drink. The regular drink, which we all got, was vodka coke. We thought it would be maybe $8 but it was $11, which was quite surprising. Speaking of expensive fare, the reason I gave it 3 stars is because the food is okay and tastes okay as well but probably not worth the money. The 2 baos are expensive and don't seem to have much inside. The shadowless duck fat fries are my favorite and I'd probably come back only for that dish. I've also tried the kimchi fried rice and think it's decent for $12 or however much it was but eh. Not the best I've had.Would probably only come back for those fries.Protip: there are hooks underneath the tables to hang your jackets on during the winter so no need to sit on them unless your butt's feeling a bit cold.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"749,5,"Best restaurant I went to in Boston and it's not even fucking close. S/o to Mike, Abby, and Doug for going way above and beyond to make a Cali boy feel hella welcome. Â I had the kimchi fried rice and it was bomb.com (not bomb.org).

Â First it was super loud, I wasn't talking, I was yelling. Â 2nd, the food portions were pretty tiny and extremely salty. Â I got the shadowless fries which was waaaaay to salty and the Shojo burger or sandwich which was the same size as a slider. Â Lastly, at the end of my meal I saw an enormous, ginormous rat scurrying along the way and scaring the staff. Â Of course, it was so loud nobody noticed the few staff members screaming l, lol. Â HUGE RAT.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"751,4,"This is such a fun place with really good food. It is small dishes, so it's great for sharing and enjoying all the incredible flavors. I also really liked the drinks. It does get really loud at times because it's a fairly small room and a lot of people go just to the bar, so that's something to keep in mind. My group basically ordered the entire menu, so here are my favorites:-Wu-Tang tiger style ribs: these are AMAZING. I'm not usually a person that orders ribs, but these come in a fantastic peanut-based sauce with lots of garlic and the meat is outrageously tender. You can just slide the bone out, it is that good. The portion is also huge. -Kimchi fried rice: the rice had great texture, and it wasn't too salty (I find some kimchi fried rices too salty). Also fried egg.-Shadowless fries: it comes with cheese and and mapo tofu like C'MON -Chicken and waffles: the chicken is super juicy and well-seasoned (tastes like Taiwanese fried chicken), and the waffle is great, but the five spice butter and syrup is absolute money.-Drinks are good too! Really like the Gin Gin Mule (I think that's what it's called?) and the Loneliest Monk.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"752,3,"I've been spoiled by amazing Asian and Asian fusion restaurants in LA and NYC, and Shojo honestly just misses the mark. My friend and I ordered a good amount of variety, but everything was just pretty average. I was expecting some hardcore yumminess based off of the Yelp Reviews, but we were disappointed by dish after dish of mediocrity. The chicken and waffles were decent. The chicken was fine. It was juicy but wasn't seasoned very well. And the HK waffles it sat on were so incredibly soggy and bland. I've had great HK waffles from LA, NYC, and even Hong Kong, so these waffles honestly felt like a very sad homage. There are sooo many things that the waffles could have done better: texture, flavor, sweetness, even presentation. Needless to say, def pass on the dish! Shojo Pig Bao was pretty standard. Nothing amazing but at least it wasn't bad. Pork Belly Dumplings were also just okay. The skin was thick and too chewy. And you would think with pork belly that it would be rich and juicy inside. But it actually almost tasted dry and had kind of a coarse, rough texture. The restaurant did not live up to the Yelp Reviews. The ambiance is def very cool and young - great for grabbing a drink in a chic modern place, but not ideal for catching up with friends/intimate conversation (because the music is super LOUD)! Drop by for the drinks, NOT the food.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"753,4,"This was what we chose for our last dinner in Boston, and we're both very glad we did. The location was very close to the Hyatt and could walk over. The inside was fairly dark and the music louder than your average sit-down but it matched with the clientle and vibe of the place. We ordered a plate of charred greens, the tiger style ribs, kimchi fried rice (huge bowl), and their pork bao. Was all delicious but we especially loved the ribs and the greens. The pork bao had a great bun but the meat inside was still a bit tough. Great experience overall and would definitely go back again when in Boston.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"754,1,"Hm... not sure what the four star review is for.The deco inside and out was great, and they had great music playing... but the food was just awful. We had two dishes and they were equally bad.$9 bao; trying really hard to be Momofuku's pork buns but failing. The meat was great but the sauce was too strong. The bun was too dense. The sprinkle of veggies they put on were old veggies - i could tell by the way it had wilted and clumped.... $12 kimchi fried rice; too much rice that wasn't cooked well. There were too many clumps of rice. The sunny side egg was too well done to be put on kimchi fried rice - should've just made kimchi fried rice with scrambled egg or something. It also wasn't ...seasoned/flavored well? They either skimped on kimchi or gochujjang. It was rather bland. All in all, i can tell they are trying new things... but for the price, it was super underwhelming and food could be way way better.",Shojo,"9A Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"755,5,"My wife & I were here on a Sunday evening 2 weeks ago, I wish I could rewind and start our meals again!!

We were seated in a beautiful booth and there was a card on the table signed by all the wait staff it was kind of cool they had some glitter hearts n stuff pretty nice gesture. Our waiter was Khalid Banassou he was awesome he was friendly had our drinks filled took our order had our appetizers out and our entrees at perfect intervals and once I mentioned how much I loved the bread there he kept me loaded up on bread and butter throughout the entire meal. For appetizers my wife got the Shrimp cocktail I got the cast iron garlic shrimp. She loved hers mine was good it could've been juicier and had more garlic but still ok. For entree she had seared dry aged sirloin and I had the bone in rib eye no complaints on either steak I've never had a bad steak from any Capital Grille location I absolutely love their steak and my wife is not a big steak eater and she loved hers. For a side we had the au gratin potatoes and those too were great. The atmosphere at this location is great we had a perfect booth a great server the meal was fantastic then Khalid came out with 2 mini pieces of cheesecake with candles in them singing happy birthday. The mini cheesecake was delicious we ordered a coffee for her double espresso for me and the mini cheesecake saved me about 1800 calories. 1 question why Capital Grille Why ? Get the calorie count off the menu I know I'm a glutton I don't need a reminder thank God the complimentary bread and butter wasn't listed in the calorie count or we're talking calories in the stratosphere !!! Oh almost forgot as if everything wasn't great enough we were talking with Khalid and I mentioned that when my wife makes my steaks on the grill she rubs them kind of the same way as they do at Capital Grille and he says hold on goes in back comes out with a container of steak rub !

The lobster bisque was out of this world. Imagine a clam chowder but better and with lobster. The bone-in kona was cooked to perfection, it just melts in your melt.

Â Finally I got a chance to do so in Boston recently and I was really blown away ... especially because it's a chain restaurant, and I didn't think such upmarket chain restaurants existed like this.From the minute we walked in, we thought we were in some glamorous movie or something. Â The decor is outstanding and old worldly. Â It's a little dark inside, but still beautiful and unlike any other restaurant I'd been to. Â When the waiter went to place our napkins on our laps, he even asked if we were ok with a white napkin, or would we prefer a black one. Â I NEVER heard of this before, but I was awestruck and knew we were in for a great experience here.The service was impeccable and the menu reasonably extensive. Â They were also quite obliging in making substitutions if need be. Â For my starter, I had the tuna tartare with avocado, mango and sriracha. Â You'd think I'd never seen food before. Â I practically inhaled it as it was so delicious, though I didn't want to dig in to the pretty presentation. Â For my main, I had the salmon (surprise, surprise) which was seared in citrus with brown butter. Â I had au gratin potatoes with it and I could have licked the plate clean if it wasn't such a classy joint. Â I swear it was one of the most delectable meals I've ever had, and was mad at myself for not trying it sooner. Â I had no room for dessert (another surprise), so have no idea what they're like, but I imagine them to be just as delicious.Having said all of the above, I DO think it's a tad on the pricey side ... especially seeing as you do need to get side dishes with your mains. Â It's the kind of restaurant that you'd go to for a celebration or a romantic date; not the kind you'd pop into for a casual Sunday night dinner. Â But don't be put off by the fact they're a chain restaurant. Â They are very, very upmarket and cannot wait until I can go to another Capital Grille again.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"764,5,Absolutely amazing experience from beginning to end. My wife and I came here for dinner on our first wedding anniversary. Â The table was decorated with rose petals and staff signed a card congratulating us on our anniversary.

Thinking about cancelling our reservations tonight and coming back to capital grille.,The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"765,5,"Once again this is my favorite place to get a proper steak. Absolutely does not disappoint. I usually get the Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak which is 24 oz. of absolutely impeccable meat. Truly the best steak I have ever had. For the side I get the Garlic Fries which are great. Sometimes I get Sam's mash potatoes which are also really good. For dessert I get the CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and it is to die for. This place is great for any occasion, no dress code. But usually casual/business is preferred so you don't look out of place.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"766,4,"I came here to try out the Boston dine out course meal (appetizer, main, and dessert). We were in this area already and thought about going here so we called the restaurant around 7pm. The earliest time that we can get the table was 10pm. So we though we can just walk there and seat at the bar. While we were walking toward the restaurant, I thought about checking he OpenTable app. Thankfully there were openings at 7:15pm and 7:30pm which is likely that some people cancelled at the last minute. I selected the 7:30pm reservation and got a table right away. It was extremely packed! I don't think it is a good idea to come here during the restaurant week without an reservation. The bar area was completely full. Also there were so many people standing and waiting for their table. I believe here has the best (at least one of the best) deal for the restaurant week in Boston. We got wedge and caesar salad which were quite a huge portion and excellent taste. The wedge salad was definitely fresh and crunch. The blue cheese dressing was not too strong and i really enjoyed the grape tomatoes that harmonized with the wedge and the dressing. I got the NY strip (medium rare) which was also a huge portion. The texture was so soft and the taste was juicy. I also tasted the filet mignon (medium rare) which was even softer than my NY strip. I think I will get the filet mignon next time. I asked for pepper sauce which got along with the steak. It was just unbelievable how nice the meal was.The highlight of the meal was the desserts. The classic creme brÃ»lÃ©e was beyond being heavenly and the flourless espresso chocolate cake was literally melting in my mouth. The portion of the food was very generous and the taste was excellent that the cost of $38 felt so affordable for what we got. Thanks to the Boston dine out week, I had a wonderful meal tonight.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"767,5,"If you're wanting to celebrate an occasion in a special way then the Capital Grille can make that happen. We had such a pleasant experience here. Our waiter was incredible, food was delicious, and other staff even made us feel like royalty.I made reservations a couple of weeks in advance for our anniversary. They sat us in a smaller room that was much quieter. They had heart confetti and a signed card on the table for us. Food:Lobster bisque was delightful. Perfect lobster flavor and the broth ever so silky.I ordered the Gorgonzola and black truffle bone-in NY strip. it was perfectly cooked and the toppings and sauce were tangy enough to cut through the meatiness. I also ordered the lobster mac n cheese. It was SUPER cheesy, only found two pieces of lobster in it but overall it was good.My husband ordered the dry aged Porterhouse and enjoyed it. He also ordered a Fresh Maine Lobster which he LOVED. I was able to snag one bite and gave it a thumbs up. Finally they spoiled us with a sweet Happy Anniversary dinner plate. It was an incredibly romantic experience and we had a memorable time.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"768,5,"The Capital Grille is top notch. I've only had the pleasure of eating here a few times in my life because it is $$$ but each time is a pleasure. I always get filet mignon at steak houses because I like the less fatty, more tender cut of meat. The filet here is to die for: perfectly seasoned, juicy, and tender. However during my latest trip here (restaurant week 2017), I opted for the bone-in NY Strip just to mix it up. The meat was a bit tougher but still had amazing flavor. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here so don't fret too much about what to get. I think the Capital Grille is the best steak house because they consistently have impeccable food AND service. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion, The Capital Grille is the place to be.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"769,5,"One of my favorite restaurant in town for steak!!! Not only this I really love their desserts (the coconut cream pie and creme brÃ»lÃ©e are my favorite and must try!)I went their last night for coffee and desserts and our order took about 20 mints to come then our wonderful waitress (Elaine) came to apologize not only that, we were surprised when we got the check, she took the desserts out and when we asked her why she did that, she said the goal was that we got our desserts n 8 mints and because it took so long the took it out of our check!

Service from start to finish was excellent and couldn't have asked for a better service. Steak was cooked to perfection and just the way I wanted.

It was perfect timing, because I always wanted to eat here after hearing great things from my friends. We were there for dinner, and the Restaurant Week option was the three-course menu which included an appetizer, an entrÃ©e, and a dessert for $38 per person. Great deal!We ordered: New England Clam Chowder and Wedge with Blue Cheese and Nueske's Bacon for Appetizers, the 8 oz Filet Mignon and the 14 oz Bone-In Dry Aged NY Strip for EntrÃ©es, and two crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©es for dessert. The dinner also comes with mashed potatoes and french beans and tomatoes! This was plenty of food and I'm not complaining!Our server was very hospitable. Since it was our one year anniversary, they put us in a more private room, and sprinkled rose petals on the table, and included a ""Happy Anniversary"" card that was signed by all the staff. It was so thoughtful of Capital Grille and they exceeded my expectations! They even offered some delicious desserts on the house for us in the end. By far my best experience. Thank you Capital Grille for making our anniversary a memorable one! We will be back.",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"773,4,The interior West fancy-looking with Frank Sinatra playing in the background. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. Prices here was on the high end and portions were okay. I ordered the New York aged steak strip with Gorgonzola and truffle. It was cooked medium rare and juicy. The red wine sauce that they had with it just complimented the steak. Sides weren't included. Overall they were very accommodating because we had a cake also that they cut for us. This place is good to try once in awhile and I would recommend anyone to come try it for their birthday.,The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"774,5,"Hi I'm MinhThis place is bonkers.The ambiance is dark, cool and perfect for a cool date night. The decor is very upscale and made for a very intimate and relaxed atmosphere.I made a reservation for restaurant week and I am glad I did since it start to fill up as soon as my friend and I arrived. We were greeted politely and brought to a table a bit outside of the main dining area, which worked out very well. Our Waitress Melissa was FANTASTIC. She was very friendly, told a lot of amusing dad jokes and knew the menu in and out. You could tell that she really LOVES steak. She broke down the menu and made sure we had enough bread and sides to go along with our meats. Â My friend and I both got the clam chowder, bone in NY-strip and the creme brulee.The chowder and brulee were very tasty and definitely was not the luke warm type of meal I was expected out of restaurant week due to the high volume of people. Oh man did that steak taste fantastic though. The steak was tender, juicy, and had that very slight waft of dry age that came out. The quality and how it was cooked was nearly perfect and I would definitely recommend that to anyone trying it out.All in all, a fantastic dining experience thanks in part to Melissa and definitely ask the waiters what their recommendations are, that's why they're there!Hope to see you guys soon here!",The Capital Grille,"900 Boylston St Boston, MA 02115"775,5,"This place is such a hidden gem! I only heard about it because a close friend lives nearby, and I am so glad we tried it out. This place is perfect for the group that has some healthy eaters, but it really caters to everyone. I've been for brunch and dinner, and it's definitely more crowded for brunch. I don't know why they haven't gotten people to come for dinner, but it's pretty empty in the evenings.So many unique options, and their drinks are really delicious/cute for photos.

It was Father's Day so the place was jammed pack and lots of people were waiting outside. We placed our names down on the waiting list and waited outside. Fortunately, the wait wasn't too long and we were seated within 20 minutes. We ordered and split the Morning Madness and the Nutella Strawberry Toast. They were kind to let us substitute the french toast in the Morning Madness with the Baileys French toast for a small charge. Food was good and portions were large; we were definitely both super full when we left. The Nutella Strawberry French toast tasted delicious, but not too overwhelmingly sweet. I've had better brunch elsewhere for the same price point, but I would recommend Milkweed for those who live in Mission Hill and crave some nice brunch.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"778,5,"A wonderfully healthy lunch with my best friend!

It was only a 10 minute walk away I really expected to wait for a table because the reviews were so great. I was pleasantly surprised to walk right in and be seated at 8:15 in the morning on a Saturday (I've seen lines around the block at 7am for popular breakfast spots in SF & San Diego). Everyone was so nice and there were so many tempting choices! So hard to decide! My hubby chose the special of the day (cheesy grits, pork belly and challah toast) and I chose the Shakshuka Â (stewed tomatoes, peppers, onions, spicy, feta cheese, over easy eggs and challah toast). Everything was so yummy! (@.@) The servings are large (my hubby and I shared my left overs for breakfast the next morning). I also enjoyed a pom/sparkling wine with my meal. The muffin of the day was a coconut/chocolate chip. I took one to go and only regretted that I didn't buy two. The muffin was perfect! Not greasy, was spongy & not too sweet.

They were all full of smiles, which always makes me smile :)Space/Setting (4.5/5): Seating is a little tight, likely due to the popularity of this place, but the decor is cute and the lighting is great, especially at the bar seats by the window!Food (5/5): I got the powerbowl + salmon and W O W was I a happy camper after that meal. The powerbowl is very filling and the salmon was good (a little dry, but still hit the spot). It's a great thing to order if you want to feel a little healthy and enjoy all the colors from the sweet potatos, beets, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, etc. I would definitely come here again to try some of the other infamous brunch items!

The French toast was a perfect portion, very light, fluffy, and drizzled with Nutella, fresh strawberries and a generous scoop of butter.

Their menu offers a lot of variety and there's a decent offering of beers and cocktails.Ambience: 4/5 Decent brunch atmosphere. A little loud Service: 3/5 Â The wait for a walk-in on a Sunday morning for 2 was pretty manageable (45 min).

This also means there will be quite a wait during peak hours...plan accordingly.Power Bowl ($13): Quinoa, beets, squash, avocado, mixed with a light dressing. I wish I could have one of these every morning. It is a pretty big portion, so don't be scared to eat half and save the rest for later! However what's good about this is that it fills you up quickly but goes down relatively easy, so you'll be ready to eat again in a few hours and won't feel awful.Fresh berry Pancakes ($8): These pancakes are dangerous. They have the perfect degree of sweetness that makes you feel like you are eating a poundcake rather than pancakes...needless to say, they can become hard to stop eating. Especially when you cut yourself a piece and it happens to have a ton of blue berries baked into it...why do you do this to me Daily Catch?!Gyro ($9): Another great option for a healthy breakfast, and you get a lot for what you pay for!The overall consensus was that we got a solid meal for what we paid for, had perfect service, and were extremely happy with our food. Come to LA, Milkweed!",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"784,3,"Boston must seriously be lacking in quality brunch spots if the wait for Milkweed can balloon up to 1.5 hours for a party of two during peak meal time (12pm) on a Saturday. I've never waited so long for brunch, and very few things are worth such a wait in the cold- Milkweed included. My best friend and I came out of our way to try out Milkweed after seeing all the fanfare on Yelp. We did not expect the large crowd outside the restaurant, but opted to commit to eating there anyway after being told of the hour-long wait. We did however grab donuts at the nearby Mike's Donuts to tide us over. After countless parties ahead of us, we were finally seated at the counter by the window. Be forewarned about the lack of hooks under the counter for bags and jackets, which is super inconvenient for the winter months.For brunch, we chose the steak and cheese scramble and the Morning Madness plate. I found my scramble to be a bit salty and my friend's eggs were a tad undercooked. Otherwise, still good and delicious. While the portions are sizable here, Milkweed also offers few things on the menu that you can't get elsewhere. Service here is also lackadaisical, as the host does not check in on waiting parties outside. We didn't get a refill on our water and had to flag down the waitress for the check when she didn't check in with us at all during the meal. Honestly couldn't get out of there fast enough. Overall, Milkweed does serve a solid brunch menu in a cute restaurant, but service was frankly subpar and I am wholly underwhelmed by my experience here.",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"785,5,"I simply cannot say enough about Milkweed. Pound for pound one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. Enjoyed brunch there with my boyfriend while visiting Boston. Menu was conscious, creative and clever. Holly, the owner, waited on us, and I completely submitted to her recommended dish (who wouldn't!), which was the veggie breakfast gyro. 2 eggs over brilliantly seasoned grilled veggies (including olives, which were maybe the best part), covered with 2 over-easy eggs. Oh. My. Gosh. The tastes were really different and divine.Coffee was great.The place feels like a perfect blend of home, sweet design, and just that little bit of brave urban pioneering that makes you want to say a big YES to Milkweed. We sat next to a gal who was taking lunch from her nearby government job, which we loved. It's not just for yelpy travelers, this place serves those (yes, I was that), and ALSO people who work in the schools and hospitals nearby. It feels authentic. Â It IS authentic. Honestly, what are you waiting for. If you're within 50 miles of Milkweed, go, now. The dinner menu looked just as incredible as breakfast, and if we'd not discovered Milkweed during our last day in town, we would have gone back (we almost did in any event).",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"786,5,"LOVE. MUFFINS.I could end the 5-star review there. You have to go and order the love muffins to understand. I am devastated, yes, DEVASTATED, that Milkweed didn't exist when I lived on the Hill. Thankfully, now that I am back at Northeastern for law school, plenty of my friends live in the area and I can make excuses for stumbling into Milkweed.I should give credit to the Shakshuka as well, it was HUGE and perfectly seasoned.

The vibe starts off cozy and serene then transitions to the brunch rush of local college students. Everything is delicious and always consistent. My only wishes: crispier home fries (personal preference) and more tea/latte options.My fave brunch items (these sell out quick):1. Lucky Charms pancakes - genius to incorporate millennials' fave childhood cereal.2. Shakshuka - I love that the tomato sauce is medium spicy and that it comes with meatballs and (practically a whole loaf of) challah bread. Portion is huge, to say the least.3. ""Love muffin"" of the day - home-made, griddled, and buttered.4. Egg sandwiches - well-made, simple, and non-greasy.// DINNER //Dinner scene is more tranquil and intimate with mood/candle lighting. They serve higher-end pub fare. Generous portions again - hey, I'm all about sharing is caring. Recommend ordering: skillet fries, buffalo wings, steak frites, buttermilk fried chicken with KALE mashed potatoes (kale never tasted so good), and a side of the coconut black rice.Service is always pleasant and usually attentive.

And it's name has the word ""love"" in it. How much cuter can this get? We ordered the last one and they toast it to chocolate melty perfection. But honestly, banana chocolate muffin can be done easily at home.

The pancakes are fluffy and soft and there's a lot - so you can share!POWER BOWLThis was totally up my alley. I basically eat power bowls for lunch everyday at work so when I saw this, I wondered how they could make it different. Honestly, the mixed greens with the roasted veggies and avocado and quinoa and everything is just a combination that can't go wrong. BACON AND AVOCADO SCRAMBLEIf you're looking for your usual brunch food that tastes good and feels healthy - I guess this would be your go to! Definitely a yummy scramble, a bit heavy on the sodium for me. I love avocado so this dish was great.The restrooms here are spacious and clean, but dark. Prices are standard Boston prices - expect about $15 per person. There is street parking available. Good for kids, dates, and I think they can accommodate for larger parties (6-12 people).

The decor inside is soo beautiful, with exposed brick and bright windows letting in light(and allowing for optimal people/puppy watching. Lastly, the service alone makes me want to be a regular, the waitresses are always so friendly, attentive and just generally kick ass women!

Despite teasing him at first for his order, i found Â myself stealing bite after bite from him. It was. A large portion, generous with veggies. The dressing was DELICIOUS (if they sold this in jars I would buy it in bulk) it has the perfect hint of tahina. The beets and sweet potato were so good- and he loved the combo of his runny egg and quinoa.  Lastly, the restaurant was impressively clean! The bathrooms were immaculate, and the half open kitchen afforded us the ability to see how spotless it was (bonus you can watch your food being cooked if you sit at the counter).",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"791,5,"Love this place! After discovering Milkweed, I come way too often! This place is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even though I've only had their breakfast/brunch menu, I have not been disappointed.

Food Review:Love Muffin: A MUST!! It changes everyday and gets sold out toward the afternoon! I've had their chocolate chip, coconut caramel, coconut chocolate chip, strawberry lemonade, and corn muffin (All great by the way)! Â They cut the muffin in half, grill it, and put a huge lump of butter on top! It's the perfect combination of warm/crispy on the edges and soft/buttery in the middle! Â If you want to find out what is today's love muffin, check their instagram (@milkweedboston)! Powerbowl: The powerbowl is really filling and makes you feel a little healthier as you also eat a love muffin. Â It consists of quinoa, mixed greens, beets, roasted chickpeas, sweet potatoes, pumpkin seeds, creamy dressing, and a sunny side egg. Â Pancakes: I've had their chocolate chip, lucky charms, and berry's pancake. My favorite are the berry pancakes which consist of 3 thick fluffy pancakes with strawberries and blueberries. My coworker loves their Lucky charm pancakes, but I was a little disappointed since there weren't many charms in the pancake. Â When I had the lucky charm pancakes, there was a sudden morning rush where everyone came at once so they were backed up in the kitchen.Morning Madness: If you're extremely hungry, this is a great choice! It consist of 2 slices of french toast, eggs any style, home fries, ham, sausage, and bacon. Â The home fries were very crispy and garnished with scallions. Â If you want to switch out something, they would always be willing to do so. Â It is a super heavy set breakfast.Bacon Avocado Scramble: This scramble consisted of smoked bacon, mushroom, tomatoes, scallion, blue cheese, and avocado! The scramble was solid, but nothing interesting about it. Iced Coffee: I love their iced coffee! It's very smooth and creamy!! A large is only $3 which is really affordable! The Ambiance: It has a yellow/black industrial modern vibe! One side has tables and on the other side has benches. Â It gets really busy and loud which could be difficult when you're trying to catch up with friends.

The outside of restaurant looks pretty modern and high class compared to the other neighborhood takeout places next door. Walking inside, it gives off a cute, modern, vibe. Small tables on one side, the other side contained benches with little light lamps dangling down. Color scheme was mainly black and yellow. A lot of breakfast business meetings were happening here. I was shocked how busy it was for a Tuesday morning. My friend and I actually had to wait for a table. Â Food review:I ended up getting the italian omelet which consisted of a mixture of italian meats, tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese with a balsamic drizzle over the omelet. The balsamic drizzle gave it the perfect hint of sweet to the salty combination from the meats. One of my favorite omelets i've had so far. The home fries were perfect, crispy and well seasoned. Summary:Cute, busy little restaurant, definitely a fan of their breakfast, wouldn't mind going to try their lunch and dinner meals!Cons:The service honestly could have been better, the server asked me how I liked my food before I was even able to try it.

Service was really great too!",Milkweed,"1508 Tremont St Boston, MA 02120"795,4,"This place was pretty darn delicious! I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but glad I decided to check it out anyway. I had two local oysters ($3.25 each), and they were plump, briny, and succulent. My coworker had the spinach and artichoke dip which she said was ok, and I had the shrimp and crab dip which I also thought was ok (a bit bland, but good amount of crab). For our main dish, I sprung for the Portuguese Stew ($17.95), which was chock full of clams, mussels, white fish of some sort, shrimp, and chorizo. It also had kale, potatoes, and tomatoes. It was such a lovely, filling dish - could have been spicier or perhaps more flavorful, but overall really nice. My coworker had the Fish n Chips ($17.95), which apparently is battered in chickpea flour. She said it was perfectly flaky and tasty. Lastly, you just can't beat the view!

The view is just as nice from the bottom floor at one of the other local places that have nicer price points for their food & drink. We ended up not eating because the rooftop menu is limited to sushi and one or two other items.

It was really packed when we went, and it was a little hard finding a place to sit but we found 2 seats. We ordered oysters, sushi, and sangria. Interesting mix of menu items. The sangria was good (prob could use some more alcohol in it, as always). Oysters were fresh. Sushi was decent. Service was lackluster.

Overall, good times because of the location and view.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"798,4,"My first meal in Boston and it didn't disappoint! We wanted seafood right on the bay and this place was awesome. My only complaint was that 2/3 floors were closed for a private event, leaving an almost two hour wait time.

I enjoyed a fresh yellowfin tuna steak with jasmine rice and a summer squash & zucchini mix that was phenomenal. The tuna was market price and a little expensive but it was worth it for fresh fish! My family also enjoyed the fresh clam steamers and the lobster casserole, both of which were also excellent. A great stop for a first night in Boston!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"799,4,"MAKE A RESERVATION FAR IN ADVANCE, especially on weekends. I was very lucky and made a reservation on Open Table for a party of 3 at 7pm on a Saturday on the second floor. The sunset views over the harbor are beautiful. Everything is pricy, but it's always nice to splurge once in a while.Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. The ""Agave Old Fashioned"" cocktail was DELICIOUS - Smokey flavor with a grapefruit peel in it. Great wine list as well.All of the entrees were absolutely delicious. I had the salmon, my boyfriend had the bouillabaisse seafood stew (spicy!) and my friend had the scallops - All are recommended! Food also came out super fast.Parking is a hassle! We parked in the garage across the street, and it was a $40 flat rate if you were parking there for many hours or even just 30 minutes!! Perhaps the valet may have been better?? Not sure though!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"800,4,"Really cute spot! Went here to grab a drink before dinner. If you head to the rooftop it looks over a concert stadium and you can hear the music a little. I went with a Malibu Rum pineapple cocktail that was mostly pineapple juice, but at least the juice tasted fresh. Lol. Younger crowd and a really good time.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"801,5,"A very good meal, experience. Went before Lucinda Williams concert.We were seated inside but near the outdoor deck so the view was nice. I had a salad with shrimp, wife had a lobster roll. Both excellent.I recommend.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"802,4,"Overall, prices were fair, food was fresh and tasty, service was slow. We came here on a Thursday night--booked it the night before without any issues. The top two floors were closed for a private event, so we didn't get to check them out. We ended up just getting a bunch of different items--crab & pepperoni pizza, Hawaiian roll, clam pasta, and crab cake. Everything was very tasty!The crab and pepperoni pizza definitely had a good amount of crab and the flavor came through even with the pepperoni. We had them bring some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little. The Hawaiian roll was fresh and tasty and a good size. Crab cake was chunky and looked like a crab biscuit--lots of meat! It was delicious and I liked that it came with a little salad to have in between bites. The pasta was really good. Whatever cheese/cheeses they use have a nice little bite and the pasta was cooked well.Service was notably slow. We weren't in a hurry and had ordered a bottle of wine that we were able to keep pouring, so we didn't really mind. The table behind us actually had a guy get up and go into the kitchen area to get their server back to their table. The views were great; we sat outside on the covered patio. The inside was nice and clean and there is seating at the sushi bar and actual bar. Would definitely go back!",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"803,4,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was awesome. The staff all signed a birthday card for me, and even obliged a special request from my boyfriend to have a framed picture of cards making black jack (I'm 21) and a Dirty Dancing scene (my favorite movie). Yes, yes he did that. We also were able to have an entire booth to ourselves(big enough for probably like 6 people), facing the waterfront view. I definitely felt very special with all of these extra miles.Now, it was my 21st birthday, let's talk the cocktail. I asked the waiter to recommend one of their signature cocktails that was on the sweeter side, and to be honest I forget the exact name but I'm pretty sure it had pineapple and tequila. It was reasonably priced considering the upscale vibe and the food prices, and it definitely was NOT a weak or overly fruity drink despite me asking for something sweet. Woo!As far as the food, everything was tasty, but I did kind of regret ordering the scallops with cous cous dish. Something about the cous cous paired with peas and scallops just wasn't the best complement and it wasn't bad but I was left wanting something more. The salmon dish was great, and the TRUFFLE FRIES! Honestly, as a younger person, I don't like to spend too much on food, so it has to be worth it, and I really don't know that my entree was worth the price, but the truffle fries and the drinks...definitely. I would say if you are more budget conscious you can definitely have a fun time here ordering appetizers and drinks. That's pretty great considering you are probably already expecting to mostly be paying for the premium location.There is a sushi bar and rooftop bar combo on the top floor, and I didn't check out the sushi menu but the rooftop had a cool atmosphere and I'd definitely check out the food at the sushi bar next time for a more laid back feel.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"804,4,"This place was really cool, went here last night. It's huge, I believe there are multiple floors that are each different (I think the top is a rooftop bar with small bites). We went to the first floor, the host told us it'd be over an hour for a table inside or out. We then wandered around the bar looking for seating and a waitress asked if we were looking for a table and sat us at one in the bar area. Random but great. They had a good drink list including ""Harborside Special"" drafts from Harpoon and Sam Adams. We started with the shrimp margherita pizza which was excellent. I ordered the burger (at a seafood restaurant, I know) which was also good. It wasn't until we paid our checks that I realized this was a Legal Sea Foods.",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"805,2,"We had dinner on a Friday evening with a reservation of five people, two weeks ahead of time at 7pm on the first level of the restaurant. Â The restaurant is modern, chic, and has an amazing open floor plan maximizing all seats to look out towards the waters. Â The walls adjacent to the sea do open up completely allowing a great view and fresh air into the restaurant. Â We sat on the second row of tables closest to the water. Â There were some docked boats with their engines idling. Â We got a constant whiff of exhaust fumes all night. Â If engine fumes are your thing, I suggest sitting further away from the open deck. I ordered the cucumber collins for my drink. Â It was incredibly refreshing and not too sweet for me and i usually like my scotch neat. Â Others ordered some beers on tap. Â Our appetizers included the fried calamari, saucey shrimp kabob, crab cake, and the artichoke dip. Â All were on point, I especially liked the fried calamari - it was fried to perfection. Â Entrees for the table included two dishes from the specials that evening; the grouper and the scallop. Â Entrees from the menu included the Portuguese seafood stew, Anna's baked Boston cod, and one specialty request: salmon over salad.I had the scallop entree, it was cooked to perfection on the grill. Â The sliced tomato and mozzarella with a dab of balsamic glaze was on point. Â I tried the grouper entree from the special. Â The first thing i noticed was the taste Freezer Burn. Â Someone else from our table tried it and confirmed. Â  Â I tried the a shrimp from the Portuguese Stew, it was overcooked to the point of rubbery. Â The sauce and flavoring of the stew was good with a strong taste of alcohol. Â I tried a bite of Anna's baked cod, it was cooked perfectly, the crumbles on top added to the texture. Â I didn't try the specialty request of salmon over salad, it looked standard.Desserts we ordered included the ice cream bon bons and peanut butter parfait. Â Who doesn't love ice cream bon bons? Â The parfait was too sweet for me as I don't have much of a sweet tooth. Â Overall, I would go back for the view, drinks, and appetizer. Â The ambiance is amazing during warm weather.

Â Cheesecake for dessert to top it off.Valet was $21, which is well worth it. Â The area is very busy after a show, but we didn't have to wait too long for our car.

But with the ambiance and service, I had to give this place top marks. We requested a table on their open deck on a perfect day. Nothing beats eating outside along the harbor during a Boston summer so that definitely bumped it up a couple points. But aside from that, here's a run down of what we ordered ---For appetizers we got the Harborside Tempura Lobster Roll, the BLT Roll (Bacon, Lettuce, Tuna), New England Whole-Belly Clams. I'd definitely recommend the lobster maki both for presentation and taste. The BLT was honestly pretty weird, and I would not get it again. Bacon, raw fish, and rice just isn't a combo that works. And you can't go wrong with fried clams. For entrees, I ordered the Char Grilled Rainbow Trout with a side of zucchini & summer squash and jasmine rice. The others ordered a Lobster Roll, Grilled Swordfish Gyro and Tuna Tacos. I didn't try the dishes, but they all looked mad good.For my dish, the rice was a little salty, but the fish was perfectly cooked. It would've been off the charts if the fish skin was a little crispier. But other than that, it was dankkkk. After dinner, we moved upstairs to the roof deck and had a couple drinks. Again, picking the perfect day to come to the waterfront goes a long way...",Legal Harborside,"270 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02210"808,5,First time going to the rooftop. It has an amazing view of Boston and it was also the perfect weather to go for a drink. I went with my bf for a going away get together for his co worker who is leaving to another state. I've been to this place before but it was only for dinner and we were in the outside patio which also has a great view and a little boardwalk that you can walk while looking at the seaport view and you can also see the airport from there. It was packed since it was graduation day. But this time wasn't really packed and it was my first time on the roof top as well so it was really coolTo go there. The waitress that took care of us was really nice too. I didn't get to take a look at the menu since we just asked her some suggestions on what to get and we only got drinks as well.

I was told two hours free but was charged the full amount for approx 1 hr 30 m less $2. Not sure who the liar is, the restaurant hostess or the parking gate attendant. Aside from that disappointment, the waterfront views were Amazing but the food was just okay. Nothing mind blowing with the flavors, but decent for what it is. The lobster roll was a bit disappointing, tasted bland and salty, and the fries came out cold...wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't get it again. The clam chowder, however, was very good and I'd recommend getting that. It is a bit pricey for the 8 oz portion though. The clam pizza was very salty. The the pizza itself seemed fine but the clam bits were extremely salty. Also, the pizza is more of an arugula pizza like another reviewer pointed out. The pizza is pretty big and is more of an entree unless you're splitting it among 4-5 people. It's a bit odd the pizza is cut into squares and not triangular slices.

FOOD ORDERED:NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER: Holy cow let me tell you that this stuff was amazing! By far the best clam chowder I've ever had. It had tons of meat inside with a great taste to the soup. Added some oyster crackers, pepper, and Tabasco and it's a little bit of heaven in every bite. SERVICE:Service at the bar wasn't great but wasn't bad. The bartenders weren't very chatty or anything but could've been because it was kind of busy. The view from upstairs is gorgeous. That's my favorite part about bars is the outside and rooftop.

A Boston native recommended that I try Legal Seafoods during a day trip to the city. I know Boston is known for seafood, and I had never been before, so I knew I wanted to try a lobster roll amongst other things. I sat by myself at the bar and was waited on by a really friendly waiter (I don't remember his name, but he was awesome). I ordered a dozen oysters and had him pick a variety of different ones so that I could taste the difference. I also ordered the lobster roll and a glass of Pinot Grigio. Everything was incredible - fresh and delicious. I feel like I got a real taste of what seafood should be. Legal Harborside also has an amazing rooftop that looks out over the harbor.

The wait to be seated in the dining area/outside would have been 1.5-2 hours, so we opted to sit at the bar.

We ended up sitting at the bar right by the kitchen and we were rewarded with a beautiful view of the harbor (check out my picture!).Food was delicious. I ordered the fish and chips and the fish was breaded so nicely - not too thick like many places do. The seafood is so fresh! I had a bite of my friends' lobster rolls and my eyes fed me the rest of the menu items.

Super hot, thin slices that were battered and served with a tangy dipping sauce. Quite yummy, really.For main course, I chose the ""Fire In The Hole Burger"" which came with all sorts of spicy stuff including fried jalapenos and a buffalo sauce.

Second she didn't want to ask about if they were serving food, because this is awkward and that's not something she does well with.Honestly though, it was a little confusing because they had their full menu until 10pm, and then there's a snack menu from 11p-1a. She had a point, but I argue that it's dumb to close the kitchen for an hour just to open it up again for 2 hours. She begrudgingly agrees to go in if I ask, and shockingly I was right.So the bar is somewhat dim-lit, great open atmosphere with high ceilings and exposed brick. The artwork on the wall is kind of a steam-punk style portraits of famous musicians. I also enjoy the music playing here, popular rock songs of the 90's and early 2000's with some old school rap thrown in. I'm at home here.What to eat? I opt for the T-money Mac n' Cheese which had caramelized onions, and sauteed mushrooms. Oh it was delicious. I was left a little hungry after I was done with it. My wife got Lyrics Boujee Brownie; nutella, cream cheese, scoop vanilla ice cream with raspberries and blackberries. She couldn't finish it so I dived in. I was satiated after that! OH and the food was served in these little cast iron pans, hot out of the oven. Delightful!We only ordered a cider and a beer, but there's plenty of options for drinks.

The service was super friendly though.My friend and I ordered the duck poutine (fries, duck gravy, cheese, with a fried egg on top) to split for an appetizer. It was some of the best comfort food I've ever had. Would highly recommend. I think the fried egg on top is their own interpretation of the dish though, because I'd never seen that on poutine before. For an entree I got the fried chicken sando (lettuce, tomato, gouda, pickles, pop's Russian dressing) with fries for $17 and my friend got a burger (not sure which) and sweet potato fries. The burger was great and the fries were just okay, would recommend the sweet potato fries over the regular fries, much tastier.For a dessert, I got the Lyric's Boujee Brownie (Nutella and cream cheese brownie, vanilla ice cream, strawberries, Nutella drizzle, and caramel sauce) for $8.

We went with a big group for a birthday, so they sat us in the back of the restaurant in their ""biggest"" booth. We were cramped, and basically sat sideways in the booth. The music was also blasting so it was impossible for the waiter to hear us. Also, they charged a $15 cake cutting fee -- which most restaurants do. But if you are going to charge this fee, make sure your waiter knows what he's doing. Ours decided to pass out all the plates and forks BEFORE bringing out the cake. That not only ruins the surprise of the cake for the birthday girl, but also how do you expect to cut and serve the cake? After we sang and blew out the candles, he took the cake to cut and then realized he had no plates to put them on... was this your first birthday bruh?The food and drinks were good though.

They also have other specials on their chalkboard.The burger is awesome. It's a great blend of beef that is packed with flavor. It also has a moistness to it because they cook the patty perfectly. It's a tad small i guess? but that's what the fries are for. They have a decent beer selection to help you wash down that burger. I want to say the best part of the burger (aside from the beef) is the pickles. They are perfectly sliced and complement the burger with some acidity to cut the fattiness of the burger.The fries were crisped perfectly. They offered truffle fries as a special, but i was unable to swap out my regular fries for truffle ones (they should allow substitutions for a fee). The bbq pork sandwich was just aiite. THe sandwich itself was good but the bread flavor was too overpowering. The menu also stated rye, but it tasted more like pumpernickel. Still it was good. and toasted and flavorful.

Their beer list is extensive which is phenomenal, but the beers can be relative pricey as one might expect when there are a lot of craft beer options. Never had any food here, so we hope to update this review some time in the future. We expect good things.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"836,5,Boom! Stop and go here!

Great atmosphere and street view.,The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"837,4,"The crowd here is a bit brotastic here given its location on the back side of Beacon Hill, but there's no denying that this is a lively, atmospheric place to hang out. There's a small amount of tables along the sides of the venue and towards the back, as well as a large open floor that provides standing room for folks shut out of seats.Perhaps the best feature about this place is the large, well-curated beer menu which, when I stopped by, included some good sours like a Destihl Flanders Red. Service from the bartenders is super quick, efficient, and professional. In addition to booze, there's also a decent menu. It won't be haute cuisine, but it's also a notch above standard pub fare. Overall, a boisterous place to hang out on a weekend night. Don't forget to nod or tip your cap towards the corner of the room where there's a mural of former Boston mayors holding court over the entire venue. RIP, Mayor Menino - you changed the face of Boston for the better while never forgetting the people that make it such a beautiful place.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"838,2,"A Little OddI came here recently and enjoyed their beer selection. They have a nice selection of local, national, and international beers. Unfortunately, the atmosphere isn't one that I prefer. It's very wide open and sterile feeling. The kind of place you expect many suits to come after getting off work in the financial district. Nothing necessarily wrong with it, but not my preference. I didn't have the chance to eat any of the main meals (just an order of Brussel Sprouts and giant cauliflower head) the apps were just ok. Â The weirdest part is our bartender had to have the worst personality and the place has like 40 beers on tap, but no one was drinking them. Â The place has amazing beer and the bartenders are stuck making these 10 ingredient cocktails to their displeasure. Â It's like the place has a personality crisis. Â While we are getting the cold shoulder, the manager is worried about folding napkins. Â He seemed totally useless. Â Odd place, sorry but it was quite evident. Â Thanks",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"839,4,"Absolutely love the ambiance here & their amazing vegetable dishes. Stand-outs are the Cauliflower (whole roasted / crispy garlic / citrus & cumin vinaigrette) & the Burrata (mushroom & herb vinaigrette / oven roasted beets chive / garlic crouton / toast points).

Refilling drinks while we waited for number three to arrived and then clearing the tables when we were done.I chose the day's special, a ""Wild Boar Tacos"" which was two nice sized tortillas topped with lettuce, salsa and cilantro with a nice amount of pulled pork aka ""wild boar."" Tasty and tangy with the pureed avocado, two was enough for lunch. Three for dinner would be about right.Nice spot, definitely worth returning in the evening hours.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"841,5,"Fantastic spot to come for brunch in Boston! We had a reservation, but at 11am on a Sunday it looked like anyone could've gotten in without a wait (which is surprising now that I know how good the food is).We started with some mimosas, and then sharing a plate of their french toast donut holes. The mimosas were delicious, and definitely a bit on the strong side, but who doesn't want that?? The French toast donut holes were a DREAM! they were so crispy on the outside and soft in the center. The flavor was incredible with cinnamon, and a bit of fruitiness from the blackberries inside. It's served over some light cream and caramel, which added so much! For an entree, my friend and I chose to split the eggs Benedict. First of all, I adore this restaurant because they gave us our own plates and own potatoes, each with one Benny on it. Then the Benedict itself was DELICIOUS? the eggs were poached to perfection, the hollandaise was so rich and so good, and it was served on the best English muffin of my life.The service was fast and the food was incredible - I think I need to buy tickets to Boston just to eat here again!",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"842,4,Great beer selection and food options.

Highly recommend for a chill place to have great local beers.,The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"843,5,"Was visiting Boston and had seen the yelp reviews of this place. Oh my god, this was definitely the place to be! The Tip Tap Room has a generous offering of beers on tap, and several ""tip"" dishes (steak tips, tofu tips, turkey tips, etc). We chose the pork tenderloin tips and the tofu tips (served with a grain like quinoa or paella). The pork tenderloin tips was one of my favorite meals I've ever had. Period. Cooked perfectly, the paella was amazing, everything paired so well with each other. It was perfect. Service was quick and very attentive. Would recommend and cannot wait to return.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"844,4,"I was so full when I ate here. You're welcome everyone. Baked brie - ooooey gooey molten center I highly recommend trying it at least once. I know brie is expensive but I thought the price was high, or that the portion was too big... I know it's a sin to say too big, but I really think it is meant to be shared by more than two people, so just split the cost and it's not too shabby.Gnocchi - well cooked and delicious in whatever that sauce was. I enjoyed the pumba (wild boar) that accompanied it and it was simply a solid meal.Rib Tips - Oh heaven these were yummy, the sauce complimented it very well, and the meat was cooked perfectly medium rare. Juicy after juicy bite and I could not stop eating even though my stomach was in severe pain.Mashed potatoes - were gross. But that was my own fault. I did not read the menu, apparently, there is horseradish in them... guess who hates horseradish? Any sane person. Beer was a perfect compliment to the meat.THE VERDICT:Do not think this will be on my list of places to return to in Boston. It was good though, and if you are in Boston a lot, I highly recommend trying it, you might find yourself a new favorite spot. Besides the rib tips and brie I cannot say I love anything else.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"845,4,"I live down the street from Tip Tap Room, so I love the convenience of it. Â I haven't explored the menu too in depth, but my all time favorite item is the everything bagel brunch entree. Â It is a very toasted everything bagel smothered in horseradish cream cheese, steak tips, hollandaise sauce and arugula. Â This dish is incredibly hard to eat without it spewing everywhere. Â Extra napkins are a requirement. Â I've learned to do kind of an open face and try to cut it with a steak knife. Â The price is about $14, and you get a ton of food. Â Would recommend it!Had the chili infused tequila coffee recently. Â I had it hot because it was a fairly cold day. Â It was very unique, but not sure if I would order it again.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"846,5,"Excellent! Went here recently with a big group and everyone loved their food. They have meal options with wild boar and bison which I thought was very unique.

Would definitely recommend.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"847,4,"We came around 7pm on a Friday and the place was PACKED and kinda noisy! Luckily they were able to seat us at the bar and we squeezed 3 people in for a seating arrangement meant for 2. The cocktails were delicious! If you love your fun combinations, the Tip Tap Room is going to hook you up! There are at least 2 different drinks with elderflower in them (my weakness), so I was a super happy camper. The entrees were also very solid and very generous!Pork Tips: The chorizon paella was tasty, and the pork was well-cooked but a bit bland. The meat definitely could have been better seasoned/marinated. Swordfish Tips: Super impressed how tasty and juicy this was! They were lightly flavored but oh so delicate in their citrusy goodness. Def recommend!Overall, it was a tasty meal with great service. We left super stuffed and super ready to come back for more next time!",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"848,4,Nice restaurant conveniently on Beacon Hill across from the MGH Hospital area. Seems to be local favorite very good brunch menu and burgersI had the steak burger which were ground-state tips and it was pretty good except when you bite into it it's very flavorful it also ended up being very juicy. I ate everything on my plate so definitely had a good meal. I recommend that people come to the area if you want to try some unconventional American food with exotic meats.,The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"849,4,"The peach and blackberry sangria were PHENOMENAL! The food was just okay, definitely something you have to be in the mood for- very modern and definitely fresh (the hummus was great for an app). Super busy during night and a good place to hang out!",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"850,3,"The first time I came here was for a horrible first date wherein the man told me I have a beautiful collar bone and talked to me in a baby voice for 90% of our time together. He made fun of my drink order (WHAT is funny about an Old Fashioned?), implied that I have an eating disorder because I'm vegetarian, and asked if I would be ready to have kids within the year. What... just happened...I left that day thinking I would never come back to The Tip Tap Room because it had been so ruined for me, and I didn't! Until todayMy best friend texted me and asked to go out to lunch and I needed a vegetarian-friendly restaurant close to my job. That has been a struggle for me in the past. TTR popped up and I figured I was long overdue to go back.PROS Ample seating Dim lighting with tons of sunlight Friendly staff (Host/Manager offered to turn down the air conditioning for me because I was cold!)Great menu for vegetarians and carnivores alikeThe food was pretty good (some dishes better than others)CONS The food takes FOREVER to come out. I don't recommend coming here if you are on lunch break. We got there at 12:15 PM and didn't leave until 1:45 PM. We spent most of that time waiting for our food and drinks. Pretty priceyTables are too small if you are going to order more than one plate each.What we ordered:Baked Brie appetizer ($15)- This was our favorite, by far. It was a flaky pastry dough exploding with Brie cheese served with benton's bacon jam (on the side! No meat for me), cipollini, hibiscus spice, macadamia nuts, and rosemary. This was absolutely delicious and a MUST-ORDER item.Brussels Sprouts small plate ($10)- This was decent. The sprouts weren't roasted so they weren't crunchy, but the flavors were good (basil, tomato, garlic croutons, pecorino cheese) and they made them without lardon for me so they were vegetarian-friendly.Panzanella small plate ($11)- Don't bother. It's described as fresh buffalo mozzarella, toasted ciabatta, heirloom tomatoes, Sicilian olives, with basil & white balsamic vinaigrette. There was hardly any cheese or bread; most of the plate was tomato and it was underwhelming. Grilled Corn small plate ($8)- Basically Mexican street corn with cotija cheese, ancho chili crÃ¨me, lime and guajillo. I didn't try this, but my friend said it was very messy, but very good!Wild Boar Shoulder ""Cuban"" sandwich ($16)- Didn't try this (meat) but my friend said it was good. She compared the boar to bacon and said the fries that came with the sandwich were perfectly crispy.DrinksShe said her Mojito was delicious and refreshing.My Old Fashioned wasn't very good. I had a few sips and left the rest. It just tasted off. The total came to $87 which I thought was high considering I only ordered a few small plates. I would probably give them another try next time I'm craving that Brie plate. It was amazing.NOTE: They are known for serving some very gamey, exotic meats. Today's special was CAMEL. Yes, the animal with humps. I know how I feel about that, but carnivores might be interested in checking this place out.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"851,3,"Great menu, great beer list, mediocre value. They've mostly transitioned away from the fixation on meat tips to the exclusion of all else, but you can still see hints if it on the menu. My gripe isn't with the food, which is delicious. It's the price and serving size - one too high, one too small. If you're not hungry and you have an expense account though, this is a pretty solid option.",The Tip Tap Room,"138 Cambridge St Boston, MA 02114"852,5,"This restaurant has a great atmosphere, with very friendly and accomodating staff! I came here with my extended family to celebrate my sister's birthday. We ordered Â a few appetizers for the table and then each ordered our own entree dish. Each dish came out fresh and very flavorful. You can definitely tell that the ingredients are fresh and the food is prepared to order. I highly recommend the baked brie, steak burger, and au gratin. The grilled corn is also really good, just wish it came with more (maybe a second ear of corn) for a few more dollars. The beer selection was also outstanding, there were plenty of beers from across the U.S. that I had never heard of, but got to try.

Koy was only a 5 min walk and was an Asian fusion restaurant with decent reviews so we were willing to give this place a try and I'm so glad we did! We walked in, the place seemed like a romantic vibe, dim lighting, close table booths and high tables by the window were available. I could see this as a cute place for a date. I heard the service was slow but honestly I thought it was average, server got to us right away and gave us the perfect amount of time to look at the menu. Granted place wasn't packed for lunch, a few people were there but not crazy busy but only one server and hostess was working. Food review:Scallion pancakes - the scallion pancakes came out piping hot on a stone plate, the perfect crisp, gorgeous coloring mixture of yellow and red bell peppers in combination with the green scallions. Definitely one of the better scallion pancakes I've had, we literally ate 3 slices each to ourselves, and they were generous sizes. Japchae- clear noodles with a combination of marinated sweet bulgogi beef with onions and yellow peppers, I'm honestly not normally a fan of clear noodles but this dish was beyond amazing and made me more open to clear noodle dishes. Literally almost ate the whole plate to myself. It's a sweet tasting dish, so if you're not a fan of sweet savory dishes then this maybe not for you. Summary:I'm excited that I found this place and can't wait to try other dishes! Pros:-Convenient area with shopping, located close to Faneuil Hall-The two items that I tried were amazing quality -I like the idea that it's Asian fusion so different Asian style foods for everyone's liking Cons:-Average to a little on the pricey side I personally think but food was awesome so I don't mind paying a little extra -The menu I personally didn't think had much compared to other Asian fusion restaurants I've been to but if they can perfect all the items on the menu then well worth it then having a bunch of mediocre food-parking might be difficult unless you want to pay for garages",Koy,"16 North St Boston, MA 02109"867,5,"I preordered twice via Grubhub for takeout, and both times it went smoothly.

As a native to traditional korean food, I thought this place was okay. The atmosphere is very modernized, and seating is very adequate! Staff were courteous and attentive! Also, they knew their menu well which is awesome! On to the food, I got the KBBQ Bulgogi. It was just ok. In all honesty, there was way too much liquid surrounding the meat, and the meat portion could have been slightly larger, in relation to the price (~$30). Next, I ordered the pork sliders which were amazing! Very juicy, well sauces, and perfect rolls they came on. No complaints here! Very, very delicious! For dessert, I ordered what is known as , or Bingsoo/Bingsu. It's a Korean shaved ice dessert that can be topped with virtually anything you want it to be topped with. The one at Koy was topped with mochi, various fruits, and vanilla ice cream. It was delicious! Overall, not a bad place! Will most likely come back here when I'm ever in Boston again!

Â Then later the fries accompanying the sandwich arrived soft and lukewarm. Â However, they redeemed themselves quite nicely, with a replacement plate of hot (though still soft) fries, apologies from at least 3 different individuals (chef, manager, wait staff), coupons for free dumplings on our next visit, and comping us on one of our two meals. Â They made us feel that our time and inconvenience mattered to them. Â We appreciated it and plan to return to give them another go.They were out of the Tofu Pillows, fried rice, egg, sticky sweet fried tofu, so we ended up getting two orders of the Shrimp Tempura ($14 a la carte) tempura batter, ponzu sauce, scallion, which arrived 3 crisp battered medium sized shrimp apiece. Â This disappeared quite quickly as we were pretty hungry by then.We shared the two entrees which arrived 20 min after the shrimp. Â It was the Short Rib Sandwich, brown sugar + soy braised short rib, house slaw, buttered ciabatta + fries that had been accompanied by the thin cut soft fries. Â The sandwich itself was a bit too fusion for my DC, but it tasted okay to me, though it could have been improved with a heftier portion of meat. Â The Jajangmyun, traditional udon noodle, black bean bolognaise was a bit strong tasting, though the flavor and texture was pleasant. Â It would have been better with more meat and veggies diced into the sauce to somewhat tame the taste.The final course was probably our favorite: Â Coconut Ice Cream ($9 a la carte) lime zest, cinnamon, torched banana. Â The bruleed banana was nicely cooked all the way through without the berry becoming soft and mushy.I've been to restaurants which do not empower their staff, and at those establishments you feel unheard and unvalued as a customer. Â From this experience, I feel that Koy is not one of those restaurants. Â Things can not run perfectly all the time.

She was pleasant to speak with and was eager to offer suggestions and recommendations. The food was served very quickly and the presentation was beautiful. I started with the cheese steak dumplings. To DIE. So gooey and flavorful. It was served with easily one of the best spicy mayo's I've had. I ordered the volcano roll as my entree and just thinking about it makes me salivate. So delicious and fresh! Ending the night with the coconut ice cream and brÃ»lÃ©ed bananas was the best decision I've made. I've read a lot about this dessert from other reviews and to be honest, it lived up to the hype. Coconut ice cream really needs to be a staple are more restaurants.Overall, I was satisfied with my visit!

The bartender also had to serve tables which kept her quiet busy but she was nevertheless attentive and nice. The menu offers quiet a good variety along the Korean cuisine. To start off I had cheese steak dumplings (gracias yelp), which were crispy and tasty. Since they were out of the galbitang Â (short rib) I opted to Appa's spicy udon soup served with rice and kimchi. The dish was good but nothing that threw me off the socks.

Their Paccheri pasta dish is easily one of (if not the) best lobster pasta dish I've ever had. It's so simple, but so flavorful at the same time - I'm not sure how they do it.Their house made mozzarella is also a must try. It tastes so fresh, and pairs perfectly with their classic prosciutto.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"876,3,"Good but not great or exceptional is the best way for me to categorize the overall experience at Bar Mezzana. It was definitely more like a 3.5 star experience but that isn't an option - so I am going to stick with 3 for one big reason. And that reason is this - my believes steak not only took forever to come out - it was then quite overdone. Because of how long it took to receive my steak, waiting for a new one that was actually cooked medium was just not going to happen. They do get brownie points for removing the 29.00 (a fair price if you ask me) from the bill, but I wish it was done right (I was quite hangry at that point).Despite an initial slow to get served experience, our server ended up being quite amazing and providing a solid experience. The crudo was delicious (we got two - the yellowtail and the striped bass) and the crostini was also quite great (with ricotta with strawberry and lardo). The octopus was good - a nice large thick piece - but the overall prep didn't speak to me for some reason. I think my husband enjoyed the octopus though. He also ordered the beef tartare - and it really didn't look all that appetizing either. I guess we were spoiled by the amazing and delicious tartare at Townsman before they closed (the Drink and Butcher Shop tartares are others I am comparing it to as well). All in all - a good enough for experience that I would come back and hope for a better overall experience. I would probably just be cautious and avoid the meat and stick with the seafood items.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"877,4,"When we first entered the restaurant, we were greeted by... actually, we weren't greeted by anyone. Fortunately, the only negative aspect of this meal was this interaction with the hosts at the front. After making eye contact with me (the only person at the front desk), the woman and dude with a mustache proceeded to not even say ""hi"" or ""hold on one second"" and instead just whispered between themselves on the other side of the desk for about five minutes as I stood there. Not only was it unprofessional, it was bizarre human behavior. After this unpleasant first interaction, I was prepared for a bad experience, but our server was very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful, as were the other members of the staff.The food itself is very good. The highlights of the meal included the chicken liver crostada and the chicken cooked between two bricks. We tried two pastas, both of which were well-portioned and very rich. The crudo sampler was fun; you get only a small bite of each type, which leaves you wanting more (perhaps the point?). The least enjoyed dish was the grilled nectarines, but it was still interesting. The overall decor of the restaurant is modern and clean. Dinner and drinks came out to about $70-80/ person. The food was better than most other comparable Boston restaurants. If the front desk could get better training, this could be a five star joint.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"878,5,"Review for drinks+bar service only! Had a couple lovely drinks here as part of the rose menu. Boy it's Cool and Truth you Can't Hide. The former more herbal and complex (genever+cocchi), the latter a balanced fruitiness (grapefruit) with a strong smoke (mezcal) that slowly dissolves as the ice melts in the drink (though it'd be nice if it were served in a more traditional highball glass).Pretty spot, and very friendly service!",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"879,5,"Great atmosphereVery friendly and polite staffDelicious foooood!!

I have also had the prosciutto di Parma app and the wrapped dates both were tasty. My only reason for deducting a star is the portion size for the price.

Made a reservation for 7:30pm, but we ended up getting there at like 6pm. We waited for about 20 minutes for a table, but in the meantime had the pleasure of sipping on some drinks at the bar!

Â -Seventh or Second - Reposado Tequila, Del Maguey Chichicapa Mezcal, Olive Oil, Manzanilla Sherry, Dry Vermouth, ElderflowerVery strong in my opinion! But I guess if that's your type of drink~We ended up just staying at the bar because I got hungry haha but it's still a lovely place to dine, if not more romantic!Food:-Prosciutto Di Parma with House-Made MozzarellaNice starter~ at first I though there wasn't enough mozzarella compared to the prosciutto, but in the end it was the perfect amount! -Langoustine Crudo with Lime, Pink Peppercorn, & CaviarProbably my second favorite of the night. I'm a big crudo person, so I was having a tough choice on which one to choose from their list! But we ended up going with the langoustine because of the bartender's suggestion. The combination was amazing~ the order came with four pieces, and I wanted more, but I had 2 because fair is fair :( -Paccheri with Lobster, Green Onion, & TomatoAbsolute fave! When I took a bite, I just kept saying omg omg omg. It was just so flavorful! Cleaned the plate, and dipped the extra bread in the sauce. YUM~-Spaghetti with Scallion, Crab, & JalapeÃ±oBecause the paccheri was so flavorful, I feel like this plate was a little bit more average. Maybe I'm just biased towards the paccheri~ it was still good! Just not as good as the paccheri. Wonderful staff!

We then followed it with the ramp and ricotta crostini and the peperonata and stratiaccella crostini (peppers and burrata-esque cheese), which were both incredibly delicious.For mains, my favorite was definitely the Arctic Char (similar to salmon)! The Mezzana Spritz cocktail was so good, I ordered two of these. For desserts, we got the olive oil pound cake, Earl Grey tart, and, my favorite of these, the affogato. I will definitely be coming back here again!",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"886,5,"I'd be lying if I said I had, in recent memory, a better fried chicken sandwich than the Monday-only Chicken ParMezzana, a massive breast of exquisitely browned bird topped with quality mozz, red gravy and a fry that made my tongue sing a constant chorus of the 80's classic ""I Had The Time Of My Life"" paired like peas and carrots with a Rising Tide Pisces Gose.And I don't like to lie. So I'm going to just leave it at that, and give an easy and emphatic five stars to Bar Mezzana....Holy shit, I want that sandwich again right now.

I finally tried Bar Mezzana for weeknight dinner recently (thanks sis-in-law for the birthday invite!), and it definitely met my expectations and carb cravings.Yes, you should absolutely order something from each menu section.1. CRUDO: both the salmon and yellowtail were vibrant, fresh, and delicate. Crudo is a must-try since it's the specialty here.2. ANTIPASTI: loved the duck egg ravioli (not plural, al-dente, and very rich in taste) and the baked octopus - just wished they were served at warmer temps.3. PRIMI (pasta): 5 choices. Highly recommend the crab tagliolini in lemon chili sauce and the lobster paccheri. Generous portions and meat-to-pasta ratio. Shellfish was fresh and sauce flavor was on point.4. SECONDI (protein): 3 choices. If you must go carb-free... recommend trying the chicken (cooked under a brick) or the hanger steak - both were moist and flavorful.5. DESSERT: I'm obsessed with earl grey, and the earl grey dark chocolate bergamot tart was fragrant and a nice finish to our meal. Only one issue, the portion size: HALF a tart... um, did the chef or server eat the other HALF?The interior design deserves some praise too: open-layout and intimate at the same time, with elegant coastal decor. Service was friendly and welcoming from all staff, but it was going at turtle speed that evening (restaurant was half-empty btw). I guess weeknights moved at a much slower pace? The other diners appeared to be regulars who liked to linger, but not us.Price was reasonable for its South End location, about $60pp (after drinks, tax, gratuity, and kitchen charge). I'd return again for another full-on dinner, or for drinks & small bites.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"889,5,"They put us in a nice room for our group and set up the tables perfectly for us to interact with each other.

Chocolate Mousse with Mint Gelato is perfect for a person that loves heavy dark chocolate. Â The Mint Gelato is different from normal mint chocolate ice cream.

We came here for a late brunch on Sunday and were seated immediately. There are plenty of indoor and outdoor seating options here. I definitely recommend sitting outside if it's nice out. For appetizers, there is a wonderful selection of crudo. We tried the American Snapper, which was delicious. It had a nice ceviche taste to it, but wasn't overly tangy. For entrees, the pork belly & potato hash was very good. This is a mix of small pieces of pork belly, potatoes, jalapenos, and rapini topped with two fried eggs. I wish there was slightly more pork belly (I think there were maybe only 4-5 pieces). We also tried the egg sandwich which is egg, cheese, and bacon on an English muffin. Overall, great choice for brunch in the South End. I will definitely be coming back to try their dinner menu.",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"891,5,"Definitely one of my favorite places in the boston/cambridge area for pasta. I've been here 4x and never disappoints, starting from the delicious bread served at the start of the meal. Then on to the crostinis. We got the smoked whitefish and the eggplant, both of which are super flavorful and unique. We also had the chef's tasting crudo, which I was personally not as impressed with, but good if you're looking for a lighter appetizer to balance out the pasta. For the pasta, I got the paccheri, which is one of their classics. Absolutely delicious! Pasta cooked to perfection, and ideal balance of pasta and flavor. If you like slightly lighter, less tomato-y red sauce, this is the way to go! I could not stop despite all the carbs consumed prior to the main course. I've also tried the orrechiete and some of the seasonals, all of which were awesome. Can't go wrong with a pasta dish here!",Bar Mezzana,"360 Harrison Ave Boston, MA 02118"892,5,"first, the bread! so warm, delicious, overflowing the crudos are also delicious. i liked the scallops more than the salmon out of the four dishes we shared, my favorite was DEFINITELY the paccheri (lobster, green onion, tomato), followed closely by the chicken under a brick (no there was no brick, -0.1 stars).

My husband said the crab cake was good and he liked the pork with candied bacon and hazelnuts, but I did not like the mezze flatbread.

The restaurant is located inside a hotel, and it's a decently spacious area. It's nice because while waiting for members of our party to arrive, we sat and chatted on the couches in the lobby. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with wooden tables and lots of sunlight. I had made a reservation, and when we arrived they actually seated us in the private dining room! It was incredibly fancy & upscale treatment. The servers were very kind, and they even put on music in the private room for us. We ordered a bottle of champagne and a pitcher of orange juice to make our own mimosas. When the bill came, the orange juices were actually charged as individual orange juices, which was a bit strange and ended up being pricey. The lobster benedict was AMAZING. I don't even care that it's ~$23 dollars, I would go again and order the same thing in a heartbeat. I don't think I can ever eat another benedict the same. Most of my friends ordered the same, and nobody was disappointed with their lobster!I wouldn't necessarily recommend an omelet from Outlook - there's a place for everything, and I feel like a good omelet only comes from a homey diner, and this is more of an upscale restaurant!

I got the Pain Killer, and my husband got the Old Cuban. He liked his but unfortunately mine didn't taste like anything it said was in it. The pineapple and orange juice and coconut flavor that was suppose to be infused with my rum was nonexistent. It tastes like I was sipping on watered down rum. It was especially disappointing since my drink was $15. Now the food turned out better than our cocktails thankfully. I stuck to Mac and Cheese for simplicity. My husband got the Bavette Steak Frites. I don't think they were worth the amount they cost though. In conclusion, food is good but a tad overpriced, drinks are overpriced and not particularly great - I had cheaper drinks elsewhere since my stay here started.

You need to go down the stairs to the restaurant, to a red and dark dining area. Yet, they have pretty good food. At least from what we had. I ordered the burger with blue cheese. For $10, that's a pretty great deal, especially since it came with a side of fries. Of course, it wasn't the best burger I've ever eaten but for the quality I got at the price I paid, I can't really complain. My boyfriend had the Dave's Chicken Sandwich (fried chicken with bacon, American cheese, lettuce and tomato with fries and a side of spicy mayo). He really enjoyed it, and so did I, from the few bites I stole. The chicken was perfectly fried. The spicy mayo was just completed it.On the other hand, cocktails are very meh. They cost more than an entree and don't taste very good. I had the Green Tito (Tito Vodka, ice green tea, ginger syrup, lemon juice). It tasted pretty sugary and didn't seem like there was a whole lot of vodka in there. My boyfriend had the Joey Joe Joe Jr. Shabadoo (Old Overholt Rye, bitters, ginger beer, lemon peel). Everything about this sounded good to us - we love rye, and ginger beer, but it just tasted so wrong. It was undrinkably sweet, and I think they might have added too much bitters as well. I would recommend just coming for the food and skipping the drinks.

We were expecting a cocktail bar, but this is really just a subterranean dive bar with cocktail bar drink prices. When we came in one cold winter night we figured that decor can be deceiving and maybe this was a hidden cocktail gem, but we didn't find that to be true. In between the bartender getting shots for his friends, he made two terrible drinks. The first was a Bulleit Rye Manhattan that was not mixed correctly, followed up by the El Diablo, which according to their website has ""Blanco Tequila, cassis, ginger beer, and lime juice"", which sounds like a tasty spin on a traditional moscow mule, but was way too sweet (probably used some type of ginger syrup over quality ginger beer) and had zero spice, which is odd for a drink called The Devil. A bunch of people were eating there, so maybe the food is the main draw, but definitely stay away from the cocktails.",Silvertone,"69 Bromfield St Boston, MA 02108"924,3,"3 stars - this place has been on my Bookmark list FOREVER and we finally got here on a Very cold Saturday afternoon. We just wanted a beer and some lunch. Walked into a quirky formica'd booth subterranean dining room - that was kind of 50s but not - a strange setting. It was pretty full with families at 2pm on a Saturday. Ordered two drafts which were pretty spendy for non-craft brews, a crock of Mac & Cheese and a grilled cheese & Tomato soup combo. The Mac and cheese was awesome- -exactly what you dream of when thinking of Mac & cheese. The grilled cheese & tomato soup was good too - but we waited f o r e v e r while they looked for a bottle of mustard. All in all it hit the spot but was prir than it probably should have been.

The mac n cheese is dense and extra cheesy plus you get add ins like peas or bacon. Their steak tips are succulent, packed wore flavor from the delicious seasoning and cooked perfectly. They come served w mashed potatoes and greens. Warning: all 3 are worth ordering but each is its own meal. Choose wisely. Love the staff here too and the location.

Upon said arrival, I wasn't greeted by anyone for quite some time and by the time the FOH showed up, it took her a very long time to get me a table, even though there were several spots open. The steak mac n' cheese arrived to be piping hot, with the portion decent and the steak was acceptable. The medium steak was fine but not the star of the dish by far. The breadcrumb topping of the mac was crispy and golden brown. The mac inside was creamy and smooth. I dislike a clumpy mac n' cheese that usually reveal a dearth of cheese. The mixed greens gives you a psychological relief that there might be something healthy about this offering. However, the salad was fresh and dressed lightly.Service was efficient and my server was friendly. Prices here are very good for the neighborhood it is in.

It was hard to just choose one thing off the menu.They were pretty quick getting our food/drinks to us which was helpful, given that we don't have a lot of time to spare. I thought the servers were pretty attentive to us. We both got steak sandwiches, so we were easy customers. I got fries, he got onion rings. Both are a good choice.

Freddie burger and fries, greens plate, and Cajun chicken tacos (with bonus greens) were great, good, and fair in that order.Taco chicken chunks were a bit dry and 2 of 3 flour tortillas seem to have eluded the fry pan, making them tough instead of light and crispy like the third.

We tend to sit at the bar, and I don't need staff to go above and beyond. But when someone in our party couldn't eat the old, cold fish tacos you served, and you won't hear his feedback about the quality of the food, I wonder why you work in customer service at all. And when your server shoves a plate of food in front of us so that the sauce spills all over the bar, then rushes away without noticing, I wonder why that person is so neglectful of the customer experience. Then when the bartender returns to clear our plates, and she rolls her eyes as if we made a mess that creates a big problem for her to clean up, it's hard to imagine how she gets by in a job that is 100% customer facing. Between the poor food quality and entitled service across the board, I realize the problems must come from the leadership and trickle down to affect every aspect of the experience at Local149.

I tried the flight, they let you choose 4 beers off a list and they'll make a flight. Which is great so you can try any 4 beers you want. The flight comes with a bowl of bar snacks, it was pretzels that night. I tried the burger there, good size, tasted great and wasn't expensive. We also tried the fried pickles, the dip that came with them had a bit of kick which was great for the pickles! And you can choose what fries you want to come with your burger, obviously I chose waffle fries. Service was a little slow, we kept having to look for our waitress.

The bartender which I forget his name was so nice. He was really helpful and recommend some drinks and offered to change them to out taste. We stopped into early for dinner so they only had the lunch menu out. It wasn't a big lunch menu and there is nothing that caught my eye so I just got a couple appetizers. The Buffalo chicken fingers and the mac & cheese balls were so good. For brunch the next day I got a breakfast burrito which was so good!

Take a read at the menu and you'll see what I mean. As I said to my friend, it felt like I was back in NYC.I don't live in Southie but was visiting locals who do. We went for brunch on a Sunday. One item of confusion (they should fix) - online says they open at 10 am but the door says 11 am. Great beer list with a large variety of drafts, cans and bottles with many being local. Breakfast alcoholic drinks were good with ""exclusive"" just meaning specific named liquor. I would order my Bloody Mary there again without question. We started with the mac fritters. This is something I would never order. I LOVED them. There were three in the serving and they were huge (perfect for our table of 3). The mac and cheese inside was made with shells as the pasta. I loved the sriracha dipping sauce. Â Glad my friend pushed them.The chicken and waffle recommendation came from the other friend and after a week of poor eating on the road, decided to carry on the trend until my road trip was done. Now I was raised with a Mom who loves fried chicken and could rattle off her favorite local fried chicken places faster than her children's birthdays. The chicken and waffles was a full half chicken - breast, thigh, wing and drumstick. Batter was great. Crispy. Nothing fancy about it. Just done exactly as I like it. Chicken cooked perfectly. Side of hot sauce. The waffle, oh the poor waffle, I only had room to taste a bite of. I did get to check the maple butter (YUM!) with it. I had to pack half the (half) chicken and nearly a full waffle to go. Sadly they didn't include the syrup or butter in the take-away container. Portions sizes are LARGE. Each of us ate at most, half our meals. The short rib burrito looked good and came with an entire plate of perfectly seasoned and roasted red skin potatoes. The lobster macmuffin is definitely unique (not a fan favorite at my table) but when home fries swapped for tots, is like three full servings of tots!All in all, I'm a huge fan of the food. The quality. The taste, and the portions. PS: On the way from Boston back to DC I stopped in NY to visit the Mom. I gave her the chicken as a welcome gift and asked for feedback.

No trip to the Fenway area is complete for me without a visit to El PelÃ_n. Like other spots on this little strip, there are several picnic tables out front as well as some seating inside. You order at the counter and get your food in to-go containers, so it's also leftover ready, if you can't finish what you order (which is somewhat the case for me when I go alone and order the plantains). The staff is super friendly and efficient, even when crowds roll in, so I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes for my order. But the thing that really sets El PelÃ_n apart from other Mexican places around town is the quality of the food! The enchiladas verdes are truly superb, and their take on serving fried plantains salted and with fire roasted Salsa is tasty and creative, though I'll admit I often eat the plantains plain because I just love fried plantains. Do note that the menu is a la carte, so if you want rice or beans with your enchiladas, be sure to order the sides!

It's a little hole in the wall since there are so many new restaurants and cafes opening up in the Fenway area. But it's so worth the walk because it's literally just a block away from Boylston and all the other fun stuff. It's a really small place, which only seats 10-15 people max.

I've been wanting to find a place in Boston where I can get my fix on Mexican food and I think this place is the one! Being from LA, I have pretty high standards. The quality of the food, the taste, and the price. Nothing will ever beat $1 tacos from the taco truck in LA though, so it kinda sucks how places here like El Pelon sell them for $3 each.Anyways, I just ordered a carne asada to go and it was delicious! For $9.10, you pretty get your money's worth. It took me over 45 minutes to finish this, but I'm a pretty slow eater. I loved the tortilla because it's nice and soft, and most importantly, holds everything that's inside. I love how this burrito didn't fall apart on me while I ate it. The steak was nicely seasoned, tender, and juicy. The salsa was not watery and leak everywhere, which I really appreciate since it didn't make eating a mess. The rice was cooked perfectly, because I've experienced places where they give out hard rice. I took out the cheese and left the beans because I'm trying to implement beans into my diet.

I definitely would come back if I'm in the area and craving Mexican food.",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"971,3,"There was so much hype surrounding this place that my friends and I eventually decided to check it out. The restaurant itself is small inside but there is plenty of outdoor seating and the time between ordering my food and receiving it was pretty short.I ordered the ""El Guapo"" since that seemed to be the item that everyone recommends and raves over, even my anatomy professor. However, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The steak was cooked well and had decent flavor and the fried plantains were a unique addition to the burrito that helped distinguish the taste from other places some but overall the burrito, again, was meh. Maybe it was because mine seemed like it wasn't fresh or because the lettuce they added was an odd topping but it definitely wasn't an amazing location that lived up to the hype. I might try this place again as I haven't found a great Mexican restaurant in Boston yet but for now I wont go out of my way to come back.",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"972,2,"Those who have intolerances & allergies should watch out! This is great food. However, it's just not consistent and they are not accommodating. I always ask for no salsa because of a food intolerance, and about half of the time I have to unwrap my burrito and take salsa out. I just have an intolerance to some of their foods too - I would be wary if you have an allergy, even if you make it very clear to them. There was also the time I saw someone pull an industrial staple out of their mouth from eating a burrito, but that was years ago. It's really too bad because when they get it right, they really get it right. But they just get it wrong so often it's just not worth it anymore.",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"973,2,"I keep hoping to find another (only one so far) casual Mexican spot in Boston that I like and am consistently disappointed.I had the Carne Asada burrito. It needs to be more than just putting the basic ingredients into a tortilla. Each element was there but they were all lacking flavor. Black beans didn't taste simmered and seasoned. It didn't look like Mexican rice (white, not reddish) and it was mushy. Tomatoes in the pico were mushy. Meat wasn't seasoned enough (tasted like just s+p.)",El Pelon Taqueria,"92 Peterborough St Boston, MA 02215"974,4,The only reason I give 4 stars is because this place doesn't have queso (why?!) & the chips weren't good at all.

For my entree, the hoisin glazed salmon, served over a bed of pad Thai noodles, crisp veggies and crushed peanuts was delish. The salmon was cooked to request, and flaked perfectly over the noodles. Would've preferred just a little bit of spice though.Our table shared a handful of desserts, including a tasty key lime pie tart. I'd be remiss to not mention that our service was professional and accommodating to a handful of requests (table change and celebrating a birthday).",Legal Crossing,"558 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"976,5,"Umm they are NOT racist here (am Asian, can attest).

Decent selection of beer and wine. Fewer seafood options on the menu than I'd expected.I got Linguini with a Trio of Clams. Good portion of pasta and clams. The clams were excellently seasoned and cooked. The pasta was well prepared. The garlic and white wine sauce was OK (perhaps I'm spoiled from having lived in Italy for 3 years). Staff were friendly but were inconsistent. For example I heard none of the specials, but the person after me got told about them. A person ahead of me was being told about items not on the menu that were available (I only caught the tail end when I was seated).",Legal Crossing,"558 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"983,3,"- FoodGood. Great. We had lemongrass shrimp soup (I am not too sure of the name) as appetizer, grilled lobster and linguini with trio clams. Starting with lemongrass shrimp soup, it was okay. Nothing I've tasted before - the taste was very unique but I wasn't too sure if I liked it. My partner enjoyed it though. Grilled lobster - we bot absolutely loved it. Amazing. I recommend this dish for anyone who likes lobster. Linguini with trio clams - the seasoning was on point. For this, however, I am pretty biased because I just enjoy garlic seasoning. I personally didn't like the texture of the pasta but this is subjective. If you like clams, it is worth trying. - Service On point. Nothing much to say. I enjoyed my experience here. - InteriorThe lighting was little too dark in my opinion. It was difficult to see the other person's face or even the dishes. Other than that, the interior is very well designed. The restrooms are all private, which I appreciate. - PriceThis is the reason why it is a three star not four. While everything was good/great, it was over-priced. I don't mind paying more for better food/service, but I didn't think the price charged was reasonable for the quality of the food. The food was good but not the best I've had; on the other hand, the price was exceptionally charged, which I'm somewhat salty about. I would have enjoyed it more if the price was 80% of the current price. - OverallIt is a good restaurant that can be great. I am not sure if I will recommend it to anyone I know, but at the same time I would not discourage anyone from going. It is worth trying.",Legal Crossing,"558 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"984,3,"Summary: Â A solid choice in the area, but not a real standout. Â You won't go home hungry or broke, you just won't remember having gone there in a few weeks.Room: Â I don't remember much about the room--it was a little dark and set a good mood for the evening--it was just really unremarkable. Â The bar area was very nice though. Â And they had a great selection of spirits and cocktails.Service: The service was what you'd expect of most chains, where the servers do their duty but nobody stands out and nobody shows much personality. Â I'm not against chains, they just don't usually turn out great things, either from the kitchen or the service. (Note: it's not impossible to be a great chain--see Capital Grille. Â They nail it every time.)Food: I've been there twice and the first time around I had a grilled Arctic char that was really terrific. Â The second time I had sole, which was good, and perfectly cooked, but nothing to write home about. Â The Â bang bang cauliflower was over processed and sweet, like Americanized Chinese sweet and sour veggies. Â The chowder was very good and the oysters were very good. Â Overall, I think the food is good, and sometimes very good. Â Value: Â Given the quality of the fish, I think the value overall is good. Â The ingredients seemed good--there just wasn't anything that really stood out consistently and it reminded me of what you'd get it you crossed a good fish house with Chili's. The next time I'm in the area, I think I'll try one of the many other restaurants nearby.",Legal Crossing,"558 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"985,5,"I had the pleasure of dining here for a business dinner. Â Without getting into too many details, all I'll say is the ambiance, service, food, and drinks were excellent. Hence, the 5 stars.

I felt silly saying that, but I was hoping it was worth it, it was not. There was not even a hint of spicy in the drink. The shrimp cocktail is 5.50 per shrimp, but it is overcooked and it feels like plastic. Â The oysters are served with too much water in them. The lobster mashed potatoes have no taste. Their salt shakers have no salt in them, which tells you a lot about how much flavor is in their food. The kid's meals are served with chips that according to them taste like dog food, and yes they have tasted dog food out if curiosity., and the grossest coleslaw salad I have ever had.

So when it came to finding a spot in the North End, I opted to check out reviews on Yelp and see if any took reservations, since the places where we waited in lines didn't live up to the hype. Turns out, hardly any restaurants let you reserve tables, but Rigoletto does!We walked in a couple of minutes prior to our reservation, but they already had a table ready for us with my name on a little chalkboard at the table. It was such a cute touch! Our waiter Matthew greeted us, and he might be one of my favorite people in Boston. He was sweet and funny, and we just adored him!After perusing the menu, we ordered drinks and the burrata appetizer to start. I do like burrata but find it to be pretty pricey for the small size I usually see in Italian restaurants. So I was happily surprised to see not one but two balls of the cheese on the plate, along with delicious garlic crostinis and a balsamic reduction. Needless to say, we quickly devoured it.For my meal, I ordered the ricotta gnocchi with their vodka sauce. It normally comes in a gorganzola sauce but Matthew said it was no problem at all to swap the sauces. My dish was DIVINE. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked and pillowy, and the sauce was just delicious. Sonya opted for one of their specials which had lots of seafood, and she was in heaven. We both were so full by the end, but that's because it would've been a sin to leave any of our wonderful meals on the plate.The lesson to be learned here: do not let the lack of a long line deter you. This place is wonderful and I'm SO glad we chose it. Absolutely the best meal of our trip!",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"996,2,"I feel bad writing this but our experience last night was just ..meh.The service was excellent, the oysters delicious, and the scampi was cooked perfectly. But everything seemed to lack a little flavor. Even the bread! What North End restaurant serves you bland, tasteless bread?!? The seafood was fresh, the pasta al dente, and the broth yummy (though they put way too much in the bowls). Â But you wouldn't want to sop it up with that bread. They didn't offer us soup spoons, either. Now, to be perfectly fair, it could have been a bad night. There was a party of four couples who could not have been louder. We had to move to a different table but there was no getting away from them. They were oblivious to how much they were ruining the night for other patrons and the poor staff. All they cared about was finishing their wine and seeing who could be the loudest at the table. Definitely left a bad taste in our mouths. We should have known that, reservation or not, there is a reason that on a street where every restaurant seemed to have a line to get in, they did not.",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"997,3,"I love pasta and wanted to try Rigoletto's homemade tagliatelle, but on this visit I opted instead for their Piadina Flatbread $17. Â The Piccola Italia with its goat cheese, balsamic cipollini onions, double smoked bacon, arugula, and fig reduction just sounded great! Â I did wonder a tad about the portion size, however, since on the Rigoletto website their flatbreads were listed between the appetizers and the salads.When I arrived for my early dinner, they had a spot set up for me as per my reservation. Â Water was provided and the food did not take long to arrive.Anyone who's been to Blaze with me will know that I like some pizza with my salad, but still I was surprised at the generous mound of arugula which entirely covered my flatbread. Â Beneath the green, the perhaps 11 inches in diameter circle had been sliced into nine relatively quadrilateral pieces. Â The crust was thin and ranged from crisp to floppy. Â The smoky bacon was the overwhelming flavor profile, and I noted that the sweetness of the onions and the fig was too light in comparison.A cold breeze hit my neck from behind where I sat at their bar. Â But still I made do and threw on an extra layer as I continued to munch, till I lifted my water glass off the maroon napkin coaster only to notice that the water I had been sipping throughout the meal had a cherry stem nestled by the bottom of the glass. Â I gagged as I pointed it out to the bartender, who immediately whisked it away and brought me a fresh glass.I quickly rinsed out my mouth, and found my appetite diminished.Generally, I find it unfair for someone to complain online if you hadn't given the business a chance to respond first in real time. Â So, I asked the hostess if I might be able to speak with the manager of my experience.He arrived as the bartender explained to me that the cherry stem had likely dropped into the glass as she was handling the fruit, after she noticed that I was no longer eating. Â So she told him that she had already provided me with a fresh glass of water. Â He seemed completely satisfied with the situation. Â I was not certain that her explanation was the actual case, however, as when I scanned the bar area from my seat I could not see how the glasses might have been stored in such a way as to allow such a relatively hygienic scenario, so I was still feeling a bit disgusted and disturbed. Â I also remembered a past experience when I had been sipping water directly from the glass at another establishment only to later realize that there was lipstick along the lip of the glass - I don't wear lipstick.When they realized I wasn't quite as satisfied as they were, I was asked what they could do to make things right. Â I said that I only wanted them to do what they would do normally in such a scenario - I was not going to ask for anything. Â I felt that my feelings had been disregarded and I basically just wanted to be taken more seriously and sincerely.Well, in short, nothing happened. Â On my part, I read for a few minutes to get my mind off my disgust and onto something (anything) else, in hopes of getting some of my appetite back. Â I managed to finish my dinner, requesting a take-out box for the remaining two pieces. Â The bartender refilled my emptied glass, and offered a large paper bag for my leftovers, since they had mis-ordered and so didn't have any of the smaller bags. Â And off I went into the night.",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"998,5,"We were starving and wanted a place to sit.

I've worked in restaurants where we've served tables of 20 short staffed. Not even, wait 10 min and I'll check. Just nope. No food for you. We asked if everything was ok and she said fine but it just went downhill from there as she closed the restaurant. They served our food and I'm hoping the bus boy was the fill in chef because no way that was worth $60 for lunch when my sis ate a bowl of soup and no wine. Next day, still closed.

I had originally tried to make several other restaurants but they earliest time they had was 9pm. I came across this one on OpenTable with reservations at 7:30. Â I checked out their pics on Yelp and studied their menu prior to arriving. My husband and I arrived on time and we were seated immediately. Â We happen to be there the last weekend of February and they had amazing 60 degree weather and had an awesome seat near the window that made for a great ambiance.

Â However, with so many restaurants around I think there are better options in the area.",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"1014,5,"We came here for date night on a Friday and had the best time. The food and drinks are very affordable (although the food needed a bit of seasoning) and the staff was really pleasant. Â Our server, Matthew did a fantastic job and has the best personality. Thank you!",Rigoletto Ristorante,"115 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"1015,5,"I've come to Pho Basil on many different occasions and have ordered multiple things in their menu. And every time, it's been delicious. While they have really awesome lunch specials, I tend to come here at night. They typically always have a 25-40 minute wait in the evenings, whether it be a Tuesday or a Saturday. Yet, they seem to do things so efficiently, and if anything, it's a part of the experience.In terms of dishes, I really enjoy their pad thai, drunken noodles, their mango and pineapple fried rice, and pho, though I've had friends order other things and have been extremely satisfied with their food. I'd say my go-to is drunken noodles with crispy chicken. Their drunken noodles seem to have a great texture in the noodle, the best tasting sauce with the perfect amount of spice, and the best selection of veggies, which I think they change up accordingly to the season (which I might be wrong.) Their crispy chicken has the perfect crispy outside, which they pan-fry, and the perfect flavor on the inside. It's hard to describe, but it's good; you should try for yourself.With food at a great value and great wait staff, Pho Basil is that Thai / Vietnamese experience you'll love.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1016,3,Delicious broth for pho with Beef but the meat was super fatty. Service was swift and kind at 9pm on Friday night. A glass of wine very reasonably priced. The meal of pho and wine including tip was $21.,Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1017,5,This was one of the best bowls of pho I have had. The meat inside had great texture and flavor. It was actually high quality meat. He broth was delicious.

I came here specifically for the Kao Soi!Kao Soi here is delicious in my opinion. It contains crispy egg noodles and crispy chicken encased with a nice rich and flavorful curry broth! My second time here, my second time ordering that dish, my first time writing a review for this place.I do have to say that the parking is kind of a nightmare but not too too bad at non-rush hour times. You can park on the street or if you turn on Haviland street there's a parking garage that you can park at without having to drive around in circles trying to find a parking spot. Both times I've been lucky to find street parking so that must mean that people come and go quite often on the street.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1019,5,"Skip the Pad Thai and the Drunken Noodles - dishes you can find at any Thai restaurant and go for the super authentic Khao Soi! It is a curry noodle dish that I have rarely been able to find outside of Thailand. The soup was so rich and delicious. The crispy noodles added such a delightful crunch. The actual noodle itself was an egg noodle sitting under the soup along with a breaded chicken thigh. Paid $11 in total for one of the best, most homey dishes I've had in Boston. What a steal! P.S. don't mistaken the pieces of ginger for bamboo shoots!",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1020,4,"To Go Review:Friendly assistance when placing our order, with the employee calling back to confirm preferences. The Pho Chay was aromatic in a light homemade Vegetable Broth seasoned with Herbs/Spices with a slight sweet taste that I couldn't figure out, yet thoroughly enjoyed.The WomanBaby's House Rice aka Chicken Fried Rice didn't seem to have much Chicken as it was inundated with rice. We both happily consumed the Veggie Triangle Appetizers, they were tastily stuffed with Potato, Carrot, Green Pea, Onion & little Curry Powder.

Loved the avo smoothie and chicken wings. Got a pho bowl and it was very hearty and large. Will come back!,Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1022,4,"Something has changed over the past half year or so. The meals still have similar flavors, but they seem somehow less rich and flavorful. The curries also seem to have less actual curry. The meat is less tender and moist. In particular, the duck is now fried/breaded, but not juicy and tender, and tge chicken is almost dry. We've been here several times in the past year and, sadly, each time had left us feeling just slightly disappointed. Still good, but not quite great anymore, at least to us. What happened?",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1023,5,"This restaurant had so many great qualities - casual environment, a full menu, great prices, delicious food. I got the Vietnamese fried rice lunch special and there was so much food, I definitely could've shared with another person. Other people at my table also got lunch specials or noodle bowls. I can't speak to the pho, but the tom yun soup tasted more like Korean kimchi stew, but I'm not complaining about that at all. I think pho basil is a wonderful spot to grab a fast, casual lunch whether it's by yourself, with coworkers, or friends. For the amount of food you get for the price you pay, it's one of the biggest bangs for your buck I've seen in terms of Asian cuisine in the Boston area.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1024,5,Lunch specials for a $7.95! Completely caught my eye walking by to want to come here for really excellent Thai food. I ordered the part I and my daughter ordered the masama curry. The dish portions are gigantic I could barely finish my whole plate of Phad Thai noodles. We're talkin family-style servings so if you have a great appetite and you're on a budget this is the place you want to be!Location draws a lot of Berklee college students nearby and anybody who is going to watch a show at Symphony Hall. The place is clean and cute. I don't think you'll be disappointed.,Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1025,5,TLDR: big menu full of Vietnamese and Thai food and generous portions. We came around 9pm on a Monday and the restaurant was nearly full. Big selection of Vietnamese and Thai food with a menu that spans several pages. Service was attentive and gladly gave us chili oil in addition to the sriracha and hoisin. My pho broth was excellent with plenty of noodles and meat. Similarly the Thai style fried rice was huge and perfect with the chili oil sauce. It was definitely enough for leftovers and will be our meal today. Definitely give this place a shot.,Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1026,3,Was expecting better quality of food based off of previous reviews. My chicken was rubbery and very bland. The soda was flat. The service was nothing to write home about.,Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1027,4,"So you want some Pho? You want some fresh veggies? Quick service? A more than adequate portion of protein? Actually tender and edible protein? I have found your Pho restaurant in the Back Bay Area of Boston... These are all of my upsides but I will also add that the place was turn tables around quickly and folks were filling the seat just as quickly... They were serving very Vietnamese dishes and hot and fast... I only waited for my Pho like 10min, if even that long... Now the down side... only one size bowl on the Pho so come hungry or you are leaving food on the table... The veggies were fresh and crunchy but mostly bean sprouts, some cilantro and lime wedges... so if you missing some jalapeÃ±o or anything else you may have to ask... I normally only rate a restaurant after I have been there at ;east twice but as this was a business trip and it was delicious, I had to post...

The pho dac biet (10$) did not have the problem of stuck together noodles that I experienced last time. It was pretty great -- noodles were a good texture and the soup was very flavorful. The papaya salad (8$) was also super tasty. Just the right amount of spicy and all around tasty. I didn't enjoy the vermicelli with pork and shrimp (9$) at all though. I don't think it was bad, just not to my particular texture/flavor preferences.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1029,2,"Not quite my favorite. Rice was mushy, yellow curry was too sweet, had pineapple chunks, and to top it off, service was exceptionally subpar. Did not enjoy my experience. Won't go back.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1030,5,"Pho Basil is on my list of top Asian restaurants in the Boston area! I typically stay away from mixed restaurants since normally they aren't very good... but every food item I've ordered from here has been delicious. Thai and Vietnamese are two of my favorite Asian cuisines too so having both in one restaurant is a plus!Pros: Servers super friendly, relatively big portions considering the price, all da food -- you can't go wrong with what your order. The pho, tom yum, drunken noodles, duck, curry, pad sew, spring rolls, etc all hit the spot! Cons: No reservations, always a wait (since it's so damn good), and not much parking in the area.

The service is good, and the kitchen will make your food without fish/oyster/shrimp sauce if you request it. As a vegetarian, that is important to me. I always eat too much of the savory food, and am usually unable to down any dessert. Maybe next time I will try some and update this review.Don't think - go right to Pho Basil..

Despite going during an extremely busy time the service was quick, friendly, and consistent throughout the night. The food was incredible- I got the Tom Kha soup and Thai fried rice both with tofu.

Â After spending the morning at the Boston Fine Arts Museum my wife and I wanted to grab a bite to eat before heading to the airport. Â We yelped up Pho Basil as it was between there and our hotel. Â We found a line of people in front of us which was a good sign but blew were worried about time. Â They told us 10-15 minutes and even though we were not confident of being able to get in that quick they sat us right on schedule. Â We quickly ordered drinks and I ordered the pineapple chicken lunch special and made it a combo for $2 more. Â My wife wanted the spring rolls and then ordered ginger pork lunch special and also upgraded to the combo. Â The combo is well worth it as you get a nice cup of miso like soup, a dumpling and a small fried vegetable roll and salad before your entree arrives. Â All of these were tasty and a nice starter. Â We then received our entrees both of which had fresh vegetables and were very flavorful. Â My pineapple chicken was supposedly to be one star spicy but I did not think it was spicy but very good but not overly sweet, it was accompanied with a nice portion of brown rice (you could have white as an option). Â My wife's ginger pork was recommended and meet or exceeded expectations with a delicious sauce accompanied it. Â Yeah they forgot the spring rolls but apologized and acted quickly to see if we were willing to wait for them or cancel the order. Â They were good but not awesome. Â Food - 4.5 Fresh and well prepared bursting with flavor. Â Loved the addition of lunch comb. Spring rolls could be better.Atmosphere 3.5 . Â Nice a cut above a strip mall / small store front.Service - 3.5 Seated us with in their estimated time range when we were doubtful. Fairly attentive, missed the spring roll order but made it right.

Beats some unnamed places in Allston, and Quincy (much to my fiance's chagrin). Get the pho satay, its a bit spicy, full of noodles and beef and guaranteed to fix your cold right up if you're sick!Long version:Food: Is amazing! Be forewarned, I have only gotten pho here so I have no idea how the fried rice and other food options they have here are. Drinks: Hot tea (not free), milk tea and my favorite, smoothies. I usually opt for the pineapple and it tastes legit.Service: It does feel a bit rushed at times when you're seated but I can't blame them. It's a very small place and the line usually ends up going outside during dinner time and it is rough standing out there waiting for people to finish eating their hot soup so I'm sure the staff try and move things along (it also helps their bottom line too).Decor: small space. Never feels too cramped though. Nothing fancy going on in here.I've tried several pho places in and around the city and this is hands down my favorite. Beware with parking. Not easy around here especially during school year.",Pho Basil,"177 Massachusetts Ave Ste A Boston, MA 02115"1035,4,"The appetizers were a bit too salty for my taste. Got a medium rare steak which was yummy, though a bit too crispy on top. Our waitress was very polite and attentive. A contrast to the hosts/hostesses who looked like bored high schoolers. Upon hearing it was our anniversary, we received many congratulations and a slice of chocolate cake for dessert. A nice surprise :) A rather pricey restaurant, but would recommend for a night out or special occasion!

Â I chose Abe & Louie's because I had eaten there before and the food and the service were great. Â However, on my special night, neither were true. Â It's sad actually, because I sent this sincere e-mail of concern to their restaurant and received no response, yet here on this site, I see responses from the restaurant, so maybe they'll read this one.Though I made reservations in advance, I was given a table near the bar, which is not the same experience as being in the full dining room, but that's not what ruined the evening. Â After being seated, I was not waited on for a really long time, and I had to flag down one of the waiters to ask who my waiter was, and no one seemed to know. Â Turns out, I had no one, so they began to take my order. Â What usually was an experience of one knowledgeable, friendly waiter telling you the specials and checking in on you, was now 3 different waiters, some less experienced, tag-teaming my table.But that's not what ruined the evening. Â The worst part was when I got my steak - the entire reason I was there - and it was undercooked. Â I asked for medium, and it was practically blood red and tough on the inside. Â I only get to do this once a year, and because it was already so late, I suffered through it. Â I know I could have sent it back, but I didn't have the time. Â I will have to wait another year to get a night like this, but I probably won't choose Abe & Louie's after this experience, which is a shame. Â I really did like it in the past.

The host staff and my waiter did an incredible job! My waiter went out of his way to provide suggestions and be friendly, with all kinds of seasoned helpful touches, who made it a pleasure to dine here for that aspect of my experience here!I was crestfallen and startled with the sub-par quality of my 8-oz filet mignon. Not tender, fresh-like, and buttery at all, which is how this cut of beef usually comes out. I didn't want it to go to waste, as I was kinda tired and hangry, so I finished it, anyway, being the food ho I am. The bread was just ok. Â The cookie dessert with ice-cream topping was underwhelming and tasted like they went to a bargain grocery store and put it together. In sharp contrast was the 1/2 order of pureed crucifer: a mouth-watering, perfectly seasoned, somewhat fine-to-mid-coarse-consistency cauliflower! Get that! I drank water. My total bill came to about $68 before tip.The interior was quite bustling and had a fun vibe.

The service was excellent and the prices were fair for being a steakhouse. Since it was lunch time, we opted for burgers and we were not disappointed. I tried the ""Sesame Ahi Tuna Burger"" and it was very good. It was cooked exactly how I requested it and it was accompanied by fries and a nice salad. My wife had the ""Abe's Prime Cheeseburger"" and she was happy with her selection. It was cooked medium-well with fresh tomatoes and lettuce with a side of sweet potatoes fries. Lastly, the vegan option on the menu for my sister-in-law was a salad and the cauliflower steak. She was full and satisfied with her selection. However, although all was great, the best part of the meal was the server. Â He gave us plenty of time to decide on our entree's and he was very attentive. All our requests were taken care of in a timely manner. What was really helpful was that after lunch was done, he took the time to give us ideas and must see spots in the Boston area to visit including other restaurant recommendations.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1039,4,This review is only based on a dessert and espresso although I've been here many times for dinner it was either pre Yelp or amnesia Yelp but you can't go wrong eating here that's for sure.  Â  Â I was in town with my wife we were just doing some shopping n waking around on Newbury st and Prudential Mall it was a nice day and we hadn't had many to that point so we wanted to take advantage. We were originally supposed to meet a friend here for dinner but I've known him forever and I know he's always late so we ended up at Eataly and when he finally responded we were finishing up dinner and met him here for dessert. I got the cheesecake and a double espresso and yes amnesia Yelp struck again and I forgot to take any pictures but trust me the espresso was nice and strong with a frothy head and the cheesecake well that didn't stand a chance it was delicious nice graham cracker crust I easily could've eaten a couple more thankfully I didn't.

I've been here a few times for brunch only and it's always been consistent. I love the cinnamon sugar bread they give you. It is warm and soft and melts in your mouth... and the cinnamon sugar the pile on top is the perfect complement to the bread. I usually get the filet club or the lobster club. The filet club is very unique... and not something you usually see on a menu. Steak on bread, what could be bad about that? The bread is soft but not soggy and the steak is nicely cooked to the temperature you request. The sweet potato fries that come with it are also perfectly balanced in texture and taste. The lobster club is good, it's nothing special but the lobster is fresh and they don't overly use mayo. They have a really second floor that gives you great views of boylston street! I highly recommend coming here for brunch.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1041,4,"Abe and Louie's is located in the heart of boston on Boylston Street. We went there yesterday night to celebrate our 15th anniversary. The host was very polite and welcoming and guided us to a table in the back. We had the choice to sit out as well - nice option here! Our server was Matt and he took care of us during our dinner. We were given some fresh home baked bread that literally just melted in our mouths. We ordered a Caesar salad to share, which they served us separately in our own individual plates. This was followed by our main course. Scallops and shrimp risotto for the mrs and blacked salmon with a side of mashed potatoes with garlic in hot oil on the side. Everything was delicious. It did take a while for the main course to arrive and Matt apologized for the delay. But given that the place was busy, and the food was excellent we thought it was worth the wait. I ended up putting the garlic and lemon on the salmon and it felt like a party in my mouth. All in all a wonderful experience.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1042,4,"I went there this past Saturday 3/17 for my birthday. I ordered the Abe & Louie's French toast. Presentation and taste wise, it had that factor. I liked how they placed the pecans and maple banana separately because I'm not a huge fan of having nuts in my food. The French toast was nice, fluffy, soft, and sweet but not too sweet. I ordered the butterscotch bread pudding; it was so delicious! I don't know if they changed the plating, however, my dessert came out in a flat plate and was square shaped. Nonetheless, I really really enjoyed it. As far as service goes, my server was polite but he didn't come and check on us as often as I would've liked, I noticed he did check on his other tables more often than mine (we were only a party of 2). He also didn't introduce himself so I'm not sure what his name was.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1043,5,"This is a lovely spot for brunch. We made reservations for a Sunday morning, and were seated right away. The complimentary bread is delicious and kept warm with a warm plate!!! It's so soft and comes with a sugary coating. The portions are regularly sized - not too big or small. I got the crabcake eggs Benedict which was delicious! It didn't taste like there was lots of crabcake but it was decent. It comes with potatoes, which are pretty good - nothing out of the ordinary. Their eggs Benedict 3 way comes with steak, crabcake and lobster. The lobster is delicious!!The service was excellent, food came out pretty quickly and we got refills on our drinks frequently. Our glasses were never empty. It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating, but I would recommend making a reservation during peak hours because the place filled up quickly for brunch.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1044,5,"Top notch experience, from the food to the service to the ambience. I dined on the grass-fed filet mignon with the chimichuri and for sides we did asparagus, the harissa carrots, and garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was FANTASTIC as were the sides.

I had the **Potato Bacon Omelette** ($15) for brunch, while my partner had the succulent, flavorful **Steak Eggs Benedict** ($23). My omelette was under salted and bland, both in flavor and in texture. Â I felt that the eggs were overdone. On the other hand, the Steak Eggs Benedict was DIVINE. Hands down the best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten! The hollandaise sauce was creamy and complemented the juiciness of the medium rare steak so well. And the eggs were poached perfectly. Â Such a satisfying brunch meal. Service here is impeccable, and there was a live jazz band for our Saturday morning brunch :3I will def come back for more steak goodness when my wallet is ready (lol) but I encourage you that if the two small pieces of steak on the Eggs Benedict were that eye opening, it is definitely worth the relative splurge!P.S. Their complimentary bread here is also amaze. It's pull apart bread, coated in melted butter I think. They're soft and fluffy, and come apart so beautifully in these cute orbs!",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1047,5,"The bae and I made reservations at Abe & Louie's for our one-year anniversary, and we ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. Our server was helpful, attentive and so passionate about the restaurant's food; you could tell he loved his job and that we were in good hands. We first started off with two cups of their award-winning clam chowder. The server suggested dipping their oh-so-buttery bread into the chowder, and boy does that just melt in your mouth! We then ordered the tuna tartare as our appetizer. For entrees, we went ALL OUT, because why not!! It was our anniversary; and we were celebrating. The bae ordered the 24 oz Bone-In Aged Prime Ribeye. I wanted to try something different so I had the Lobster Savannah, which comes with of course, the lobster as well as mushrooms, peppers, parmesan, and sherry cream sauce. When the orders came out, both our jaws dropped; THE ENTREES WERE HUGE. Abe & Louie's does not hold back on their portions! Key lime pie is our favorite dessert, and whenever restaurants have it on the menu, we have to order it. However, we were full from the entrees so we asked for the check. BUT THE RESTAURANT AND THE SERVER DID THE SWEETEST THING. They delayed our check so Â they could tell the kitchen to bring us their chocolate cake and ice cream dessert for our anniversary. We were wondering the entire time why it was taking a while for the check, but it was because they wanted to surprise us! 11/10 for the amazing customer service. Abe & Louie's truly cares about their customers. This restaurant has wonderful food and excellent customer service. It's not one of those restaurants that charge you $50 for an entree the size of your thumb, and you leave hungry. It's definitely WORTH the price. I highly recommend this to everyone!

These were some of the best rolls I have ever had. I ordered the ribeye steak with fries. The food came out within 15 minutes. The steak and fries could not have been better. The steak was seasoned wonderfully and cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested. The fries were perfectly thick. I am still thinking about this meal. The wine and cocktails were also delicious.

It was a busy night so the four of us decide to do a dinner seated at the bar. We tasted the Lobster Mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts, tuna, cauliflower mashed, and chocolate cake. Â We covered a lot of menu! The lobster Mac and cheese was very cheesy and had some good bites of lobster. I would def try this out if you love Mac and cheese.I didn't try much of the Brussels sprouts, but they had a good bite.The tuna was seared on the outside and rare in the middle. It had lots of pepper crust on it, so be aware of that spice when you take your first bite.The mashed cauliflower blew my mind! I'm now the biggest fan. If you didn't know, you'd think it was just mashed potatoes, but really really delicious. One of my favorite dishes.And then we finished with chocolate cake... OMG, please save room for this huge slice of heaven. It's super rich with a fudge like icing. They add a scope of vanilla ice cream on the side to complete this perfection.The bartenders were friendly and I was glad we hung out with them.",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1053,4,"After celebrating my bday dinner here, my gf and I returned to for hers. Â Using the lessons learned from our last experience, we skipped the appetizers (nothing interesting, underwhelming) and placed an order for the porterhouse. Â Definitely get an add-on for your steak (we ordered hollandaise sauce) because as good as the meat is here, the cuts are larger so it'll help keep you interested in every bite.Contrary to other reviews, we were unable to order the porterhouse cooked to two different temperatures. Â The waiter's explanation was that the 40-ounce steak is a single piece of meat, but didn't seem to comprehend the idea of separating the strip from the tenderloin and leaving one cut in the oven longer. Â Whatever, we would have only ordered rare and medium-rare anyways. Â The creamed corn and creamed spinach from our previous visit were flops, so we tried two different yellow and green sides with the mac & cheese and asparagus.We ordered the porterhouse rare and it showed up exactly as requested - land sushi. Â Ok maybe more like land sashimi, but land sushi definitely flows better. Â My gf was a little freaked out about how cool the center was and only ate a few slices of the filet. Â I found myself more interested in the strip than the filet but since my gf didn't quite pull her 95-pound weight in taking down the porterhouse, I binged my way through and left her the sides. Â The mac & cheese was a big hit with both of us, we were both surprised since we're not typically fans of baked macs - especially the breadcrumb topping. Â However this mac wasn't dried out and the cheese sauce was truly a sauce versus melted cheese goop. Â The breadcrumb topping is sparse and exists enough just to give you a slight crunch in each bite. Â The simple olive oil and salt/pepper-seasoned asparagus was a good break from all the savory flavors.Because we mentioned the birthday ahead of time in the reservation, a slice of the chocolate cake and scoop of vanilla ice cream was provided free-of-charge. Â My gf was excited all week for this desert, however did note that she thought that the slice was bigger at my birthday dinner when we forgot to mention the occasion and paid full-price for the desert.If you made it through my entire review I'll offer you a pro-tip: register your email and get a coupon for $50 off your order of $150+. Â You can always order irish coffees if you approach the end of your meal and need a few more dollars to meet the minimum =].",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1054,5,"The place was closed to Newbury Street and there were plenty of people when we went there on a Friday evening. The steak was pretty good and vegie was also quite tasty. However, the best thing about this place was the decoration and the service-outstanding, really!",Abe & Louie's,"793 Boylston St Boston, MA 02116"1055,5,"Amazing Amazing.I saw an article online about this store (MIT students made a machine making bowl). We thought it was cute and decided to give a try here on our visit to Boston.Not only the experience was super cool and unique but also the bowl was HOT!!! Sizzling hot bowl for that price? Please bring it to NYC. My bf, tired of those pricey, cold bowls from his lunch in the nyc, says he misses Spyce from time to time. We had the latin bowl. Do not forget to add jalapeÃ±o from the ingredient section (if u want it). It is little bit in the bottom and easy to miss. And be aware of what the staff puts in your bowl. I specified no cilantro, and she almost put it in until I stopped her. Human makes mistakes!! LoLThe drink with some kiwi was okay but was not that good. Will not recommend it. As it seemed it did not go well with the taste of the bowl. At least the latin one.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1056,4,"Such a cool concept! Having a robot essentially prep, cook and serve the food- so efficient. It also means that portions are going to be the exact amount each time and the food will be cooked exactly the same way each time. Consistency. And the food itself is not bad! It's as hearty as a Chipotle burrito bowl and as unique as some Sweet Green bowls (one of the options had pomegranate in it!). The variety of options makes it a good place for a group with differing preferences!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1057,4,"Super fun and convenient place where a machine cooks your food! You order on a tablet when you get in and can choose among several bowls (you can customize them also). Then, the machine receives your order and you can see your food being cooked (your name shows up!). It's incredibly fun and fascinating to watch as it prepares, cooks, and plates your food. The final step is done by humans as they add your toppings and put a sticker with your name on the bowl. The personalization is a nice touch as well as you feel like you have complete control over your order. The bowls start at $7.50 (you can add extras), which is incredibly cheap among similar stores!The space is really small though, and it gets very crowded during meal time. Probably best to grab and go.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1058,5,"Awesome! Food was actually good. Portion size was just right, I didn't feel overly stuffed and I left happy. The flavors were spot on especially for the indian and Mexican Â bowls. It was fun to watch the food being ""cooked"". I think it's just warming and mixing things. The cooking bowls are cleaned in between bowls (as a vegetarian this is very important to me). I can't wait to try the other flavors!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1059,5,"LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PLACE I thought this was going to be a hype-trap: you go once to see the robots, the food is subpar, and you never go back,NO.I would come here if there were no robots; they're the cool icing on the cake but the food steals the show!I walked in and an employee complimented my outfit and was super friendly.I'm liking this place...I went over to the screens and saw that the menu was divided into sections and vegan was an option. I almost cried.I selected the Moroccan bowl, customized it to be grain-free and swapped almonds with pomegranate for $1 more and then watched the robot go to work. The process ended with an employee garnishing my food for me and then it was handed to me with my own Alex C. sticker. So cute andDE-LI-CIOUSThe flavors of the Moroccan bowl work perfectly: cinnamon, coriander, cumin, and allspice with raisins and olives and kale. My gosh, this was so good and well worth the price ($7.50 plus the additional dollar for the pomegranate). I will DEFINITELY be back. I have been going to Dig Inn because it was Boston's only other vegan, healthy, customizable joint. Now Spyce is in town in the same price point with unique flavor profiles. I'm not a fan of Boston, but I'm a happy camper now.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1060,5,"Great Scott!I've seen some robot based/enhanced places. Roller coaster restaurant in Europe, some robot-based bar in Vegas, and now this.I had passed it previously, thinking ""oh, just another place making bowls..."" and kept walking without even so much as a glance inside.Until today... sitting (rather standing) on the red line looking for ""Hot and new"" places in the area. Not wanting something loaded with carbs, I thought I'd go for a bowl... plus I really wanted to see what the robot thing was all about.About the robot thing: you order at a terminal. They start you off with seven bowls, but these are incredibly customizable and then wait for your name to pop up above one of the cooking stations. Don't worry, Skynet isn't coming soon, the robots only cook the hot stuff. The fresh elements are then added by a human! It's also really freaking cool!But how about the taste? Spot on. I had the Latin bowl by the way, with added egg and some crisp spicy rice (puffed rice?).You know how I'm always yammering endlessly about balance? Well, they've mastered it like a Cirque du Soleil acrobat! Proteins and veggies were all in balance, without any one ingredient overwhelming another with its sheer quantity. There was freshness, savoriness, a little oiliness from the avocado. What I liked most of all is that the fish wasn't overloaded with salt!They don't skimp on the meat either, there was an appropriate (without disrupting balance) quantity of chicken. By the way, it was tender and flavorful! Speaking of flavor, I disagree with those who claim blandness. It's not in your face, but it's not devoid of oomph in the slightest. Regarding the drinks... I was able to try the Limeade and Hibiscus Ginger. I am also really digging the fact that they come unsweetened, and you add syrup to taste. This way, you don't overload your cup with unwanted sugar.Service was fairly quick, friendly, and nice!I also have a couple suggestions for possible improvement to share. - Avocado Crema was good, but I am not sure if it can be called crema (could be dead wrong here). It is more like a highly pureed guacamole (avo., salt, lime and lemon juices)- Lack of straws... I understand they are trying to be great environmental stewards, but in a place with somewhat of an emphasis on the to-go aspect, straws and lids would be helpful. - Spiciness - They have some sriracha for adding some heat, but as a lover of heat, I would love to see more varieties of hot sauces- Syrup - All I have to say here is a slightly better dispenser, like the ones used for olive oil that give a nice steady pour. The one they have is rather unwieldy and requires shaking. (unless this is what they were going for).",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1061,5,"This is probably one of the coolest spots in all of Boston. They only have two workers inside, the food is mostly made by robots. The only human interaction with the food is adding sauce and putting the lid on top of the bowl. You even place your order with machines! The food is delicious, I had the Indian and it was a great blend of sweet and spicy with neither being too overwhelming. And the best part is the price, because the food is made by machines, it's an incredible place!!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1062,4,"I wouldn't say that it's cooked by robot, but lunch here is definitely cooked by machine. A nicely organized machine that you program at the kiosk with your style and extras and then the machine adds it up and pours it into a hot stir bowl that slowly rotates to cook your food. When it's done, it simply turns the bowl into your to go bowl and then it cleans itself ready for the next meal. Pretty slick, really.I chose the Moroccan and added extra chicken. It didn't take long until I could see my name up in lights watching my lunch being cooked. A few minutes later, it was poured out and my name was called. Super easy and simple. Tasty and spicy, cooked exactly to the specifications I programmed.The automation here is neat to see and the system is quite organized. I'm impressed.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1063,5,"This place is really cool I had to visit when I saw some other reviews raving about Spyce in the area. I wanted a quick lunch and wanted to see if the food was as good as people say. I walked to the kiosks to place my order it was very simple to use and I had no trouble making my bowl. I ordered the thai bowl with a few add ons and was only about $8 not bad! I got a seat and saw my name appear over the pot that it was going to be cooked in. It got me really excited to watch my food be prepared and wait till it was ready. It took about five minutes to be made the guy added a few toppings and called my name to pick it up. I was amazed how well the food was prepared and the bowl had a sticker with my name on it. The bowl itself was very good I did not need to add anything to it because it had plenty of flavors mixed in. For the price, quality of food and service I give this place a 5/5.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1064,5,"If you're still a die hard fan of The X-Files then you will have surely seen last seasons episode where Mulder and Scully visit a restaurant run completely by robots and technology. While Spyce doesn't take it that far, it's almost there. You order via a touch screen, pay with card or cash (first human contact) then watch as your order is cooked by machines. Finishing touches are done by humans before you get your bowl. I ordered the Indian bowl and the Thai bowl. Both were packed with flavours that I can relate to. The Indian bowl could have used more spice. To be fair, the option was given to add jalapeÃ±os to the bowl however- jalapeÃ±os aren't an Indian or Thai variety of chilli.Great food, fresh tasting and of course it's quite the show watching robotics and machines making your food. I'm just waiting for them to incorporate a drone delivery service!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1065,5,"This creative, state of the art, and delicious restaurant was a great pick for lunch or dinner.

The food was so good and just the fact that it was cooked by robots made it even better.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1066,4,New restaurant with a great concept. Affordable. Simple. Delicious. The food is prepared and cooked by machines and garnished by the employees. You walk in and place your order at the many kiosks Â for ordering. There isn't a lot of space or seating but it is a vibrant atmosphere.Watching the machines collect the ingredients for your order then cooked in a rotating cooking bucket before it gets dropped neatly into your bowl. One of the few places where your food actually looks as advertised!The great thing about having an automated cooking system like this is a high degrees of consistency in the quality of the food being cooked.I definitely recommend going here to try out the food and i will definitely be back to try each item on the menu,Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1067,5,"I've been to Spyce twice now, once in opening day, and once a few days later.The automation concept is the obvious selling point here; Â It's really neat. Â You place your order on a computer, which is great for these bowl-type places because of the wide variety they offer... Easier to push buttons on a screen than shouting at a human in a noisy room across a food guard.You can see the little boxes whizz by on the track ferrying your ingredients, watch them dump the food into the cooking device, then watch your meal spin and cook in front of you.While your meal is cooking, it shows your name and your order on a circular screen above, which lets you track your food. Â I love this feature, but it just SCREAMS for a circular progress bar.The human interaction comes at the end, when they put some finishing touches on your bowl (creamy toppings, lemon juice, etc), then put a lid on it. Â It would be neat to see this automated in the future.The food itself seems to be a debated topic. Â I thought it tasted great, though a few of my friends considered it average. Â All I can say is that for $7.50, you're not going to get a better tasting bowl. Â Flavors are well thought out and balanced, textures are considered and executed, and there's no shortage of seasoning. Â I tried the Latin Bowl and the Moroccan bowl, and enjoyed them both.The Latin bowl has a nice touch of heat from braised chilies, mellowed out by a combination of a cool cabbage slaw, radish, and an avocado crema. Â Roasted chicken, black beans, and brown rice give the bowl a hearty, savory core. Â Onions, garlic, and some toasted spices give a nice finishing, elevated touch.The Moroccan bowl uses a ""ras el hanout""--a spice blend from North Africa--to pack a punch of flavor. Â At Spyce, this is a blend of cinnamon, coriander, cumin, and allspice. Â Mediterranean staple ingredients like chickpeas, olives, and currants are enhanced by the ras el hanout, with everything getting pulled together by the cool yogurt on the side.Love the idea of this place, and I hope other entrepreneurs build on it.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1068,5,Spyce has brought the future of fast casual dining to DTX. And it's awesome. Sure a lot of the intrigue might be the pure novelty of it and this surely isn't to say that all restaurants should be automated this way but they've done a fantastic job streamlining part of the fast casual prep process and I'm excited to see them expand. We tried both the chicken and rice and Indian bowls - both of which were delicious. Love the pomegranate on the chicken and rice bowl! Fresh ingredients and you cannot beat the $7.50 price tag per bowl in the area. By far the healthiest and best value bowls you're going to find in downtown Boston.,Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1069,5,"If this is the future of convenience food, count me convinced! The ordering and cooking were both painless and quick. No chance of an employee mishearing an order, the tablets are super simple! No more wondering about how long the food will take, you can see your food as it cooks! If you want to communicate with a human, no worries, there are still some humans around to answer questions or sprinkle on your pomegranate seeds.I must say, I was a disappointed when I first saw the portion of food. For ~$10 each, and considering Spyce is saving on labor costs using the robots, I was expecting a bigger meal. However, what the meal lacks in volume, it more than makes up for in freshness and taste. I was honestly impressed with how good the ingredients were. I tried the chicken and rice (with added salmon), as well as the Indian bowl. Both were very tasty and well cooked. I slightly preferred the chicken and rice bowl, both I'm sure you'd enjoy either of them!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1070,4,"I had jury duty nearby and came here today for lunch with some other jurors. I heard about this place through some online articles and through some pictures a friend had taken when she came here. The concept is very interesting.Upon walking in, you're typically going to be in line for one of the 5 or 6 kiosks they have for you to order your food. There was maybe 8 people ahead of me but the line went down very quick. Â The kiosk itself is very easy and intuitive to use; not full of options that confuse you. Ordering was a breeze and then you get to watch your food being spun around in the automated wok things! They have an electronic board on top of each ""wok"" that announces the name and what dish is being made. It's definitely cool to see the little machine come by and drop your ingredients into this ""wok"" and then the ""wok"" proceed to continuously spin for a bit before dumping it into the bowl with great accuracy. The garnishes are put on/in by humans and then a sticker is slapped on your covered bowl with your name on it. People get creative with these names..I watched a dish get made for Batman.One of the jurors got a drink and was wondering where the straws were. He asked a staff member and they said they don't have straws because they're environmentally-conscious, to drink it the old-fashioned way. Pretty great, although maybe they should have a sign near where the utensils are so you're not blindly searching for a solid minute or two.As for the actual food, I got the Thai bowl and so did another juror. We both thought it was great. Filling and decently-priced for the area at about $8 with tax. Straw juror actually chose from the vegan menu, which was also very easy to find on the kiosk. He enjoyed his meal too. They also have a gluten-free menu on the kiosk so this place is really trying to appeal to the masses.If I'm ever in this area again, I'd probably stop by.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1071,5,"Great concept. These guys are really trying to push the boundaries of how food is prepared and served. Came on a Friday lunch rush and the line was pretty long. However, the line just kept moving and I was able to order and get my food in roughly 10-15 min.As for the food, although it is robot prepared, tasted awesome. The sauces and the ingredients we're fresh and super tasty. I got the chicken and rice and it seemed like a lighter yet just as tasty version as the ones in NYC.Hope to see this place grow to many other places. Keep up the good work guys!",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1072,5,"Chef Daniel Boulud and some MIT frat boys-turned-entrepreneurs have come together to create a restaurant which is both nerdy and delicious. Plus healthy and affordable. And easy to get to and fast and fun. All the wins!I was lucky to get invited to get a free taste of Spyce before their official opening. After an easy 3-minute walk from Government Center, I found myself in a line waiting to order on a row of kiosks. There are 7 bowl options which all sound well thought out and tasty. Once it's my turn at the kiosk, I choose the Thai bowl, which has roasted chicken, sweet potatoes, and bok choi in a Massaman curry sauce. I opted to switch out the brown rice for freekeh and could have added on other items to customize it like an egg or avocado crema. I decided to stick to the original recipe to really get a taste for the bowl they're going for. After submitting my order, I stood with the rest of those waiting, watching the robots work their magic. Much of it is behind the scenes, but patrons can see robots moving horizontally, dropping ingredients into the different drums and then the drums spinning, cooking everything up. A staff member then picks up the bowl and adds the finishing touches, along with a lid and a sticker with your name on it. Once your name is called, you pick up your treasure and are free to add Sriracha and Cholula hot sauces at the side table. You can also fill your drink cup with iced tea, limeade, or hibiscus ginger tea.I sat myself down at a table and lifted the lid, immediately smelling the delicious spices in the curry. Digging in, the chicken and sweet potato mixed beautifully with the other ingredients and the flavors were intense yet well-balanced. It tasted much better than I had expected, honestly. I had to keep reminding myself that robots had done this! I doubt I could have made it better with my own hands. And it would have taken me much longer too.Each bowl is $7.50 (add-ons can be more) and you can have food-in-hand in under 15 minutes. It's a great place even without the robots. But c'mon, the robots make it that much cooler.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1073,3,"I liked the concept, how efficient everything is and the interior. Food has a lot of flavor: note the name Spyce, but also too salty to my taste. Price is very reasonable. I like how their beverages are all unsweetened. Not a lot of options to choose from. The moroccan bowl I got had mostly grains and very little cooked down greens.",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1074,3,"Tldr 3.4/5- food wasn't bad, tastes like something I can make at home- herbs, greens, and fruit were fresh- portion could've been larger for the price paid. Needed more chicken and carbs (look at my review for noon. You can see how much chicken is in the bowl)- extras like the herbs, greens, and fruits are an additional cost and you would think they'd add more- no option via kiosk to order extra chicken or grains - verdict: try it once . Ear here again if you can afford toLocation: downtown crossingService: you order from a kiosk, so there's little human interaction aside from the people helping near by. Â I can see why people would like this concept- get your order fast and some people have anxiety in social interactions. I can dig it.Food: I got an Indian bowl with chicken, freekeh (middle eastern grain that has more chew than rice), kale, pomegranate, herb salad, and yogurt.Food cooking process- I'm not sure how it works, but after you place your order you see it going into this drum or tumbler thing. And then after a 2-4 mins it's done.I think most of the ingredients are cooked in the back and maybe thrown into the machine to heat up? Not sure. They didn't really explain how it worked.Tastewise- it's good. Kind of like a fried rice with curry seasoning/powder with chicken strewn throughout. Â The curry flavor tastes like madras curry which you can find at your local market. Â The bowl was seasoned properly as well, just the right amount of salt, although for my personal preference I would've liked it to be have more heat. Â Additionally there were curried potatoes in the freekah mix. This was cool.herbs, kale, and the apple tasted fresh. Â I like the herb salad- which consisted of cilantro and mint- because it added a vibrant flavor to the bowl. Â This part reminded me of Vietnamese food which I grew up eating. The kale wasn't cooked down all the way to mush and had nice crunch, still had the dark green hue too. The apples were a nice touch as well because they added tartness and a crunch factor.I can't really comment on the pomegranate seeds since they weren't included in my bowl. Would've been nice though. Maybe they ran out? Â :/Portion size- hmmmm this is where I deduct a star or 2.Base bowl comes with your choice of rice or freekah with chicken and yogurt.The other items- herb salad, apples, kale, and pomegranate- all cost Â extra. Even with all the extras I wasn't full after eating it. Â  and there wasn't a way to add extra grains via the kiosk either. Not much chicken in the bowl as well.Then again I got this for free.Price- $11.24 for. Everything. Â Bowl alone was $7.50. Â Pomegranate was $1. Apples, herb salad, kale were $0.70 each.Sales tax was $0.64.Verdict- it's not bad. Â Flavors were good to me, but it seems like it's something I can make at home and the prep wouldn't be so hard. Â The portion wasn't that big for something that costs $11.24. For this price I can go a couple of doors down to Noon and get a bowl with extra chicken and all their selections of toppings. This bowl always fills me up. Or I can go farther down to Chipotle and grab a steak, chicken, tofu bowl with extra chicken, and or guac.I think for the price the base bowl should come with kale and the herb salad otherwise you get a plain grain and chicken bowl with just yogurt. I got this bowl free of charge so I can't complain. Just thought I'd give my honest opinion on it.3.4/5",Spyce,"241 Washington St Boston, MA 02201"1075,5,"Came here with relatives who were staying at the Westin and it was the closest we'll rated place--then when we got there, realized friends had just raved about it.We got there early, around 5:30, so no wait.

I hadn't really spent any time in this part of South Boston before, and from our Lyft ride to the restaurant, was not expecting to see tons of people. But I was super glad we had a reservation because there was a line out the door, with people rolling in every few minutes. This place was POPPIN' like Orville Redenbacher! I felt like every yuppie that side of Boston had found their way to Loco with ten of their yuppie best friends--which is fine because I was able to blend right in. It took 10-15 minutes to get our reserved table, but they were legitimately about to overflow with people, so this was not a problem. We found the servers and all the staff to be very friendly. The lady who served out table in particular was good about recommending drinks. Given the huge crowd around the bar, it was loud, and I mean LOUD inside...my ears were actually ringing for an hour after I left. But again, this is clearly a suuuuper popular place on an otherwise relatively dead block. Now for the menu: We enjoyed the guac and salsa trip. The chips have a consistency half between a pita chip and tortilla chip, which was interesting. I liked that the salsas were either different, and the grilled zucchini & habanero one had a nice kick to it. They have a fun margarita menu with creative names like The Britney (watermelon/mint margarita) and the Little Devil (jalapeÃ±o tequila). The El Jefe (aka classic) Margarita was OK, but tasted just a smidgen watered down.The buffalo chicken tacos were buffalo chicken tacos, although nothing to go crazy about. They use fresh toppings. We enjoyed the carne asada tacos, which were reminiscent of of carne asada in Texas/Oklahoma (that's a ogod thing). Big ups to Loco for being really attentive to my seafood allergy; they proactively filled me in on the stuff I couldn't eat, which was fantastic service. Much appreciated!

Went on Sat. during brunch hours and despite not having a reservation we were seated pretty quickly. The hostesses and our waitress were all very nice. I really liked their brunch menu because it was very diverse. For drinks I went with a mimosa and my friends had the coconut margaritas - both were great and strong! For food we started with the chicharron guacamole and we were blown away. SO. MUCH. FLAVOR! I could've easily ate a whole order by myself. Even the tortillas, which were dusted with paprika (I think), were delicious. For the entree I decided to go with three of the tacos and most of my friends went with the carnitas omelette. The tacos were all priced between $5-$7, a little pricey but worth it because they're very hearty and full with toppings. My favorite was the shrimp, followed by the Baja Fish, and lastly the Chipotle Lime Chicken. Loved the open/rustic decor and the lively atmosphere, its the perfect setting to eat out in the summer.Lucky for whoever lives in Boston they have $2 tacos during taco Tuesdays and my friend was telling us they're delicious. I will def. pay this restaurant another visit next time I'm around!",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1083,5,"I came here with a friend around happy hour/dinner time and it was packed! After spending some time (and having a few drinks) here, I can see why! The vibe in the place is great- a lot of good energy and was a big crowd for a Wednesday night. I tried the coco margarita which was really tasty but the El Jefe margarita was on point. We started with the Crab Guacamole- interesting combo! It was delicious- I would highly recommend. I did the Grilled Shrimp and Baja Fish tacos as my entree- both really good. I wanted to try so many more! We had put our name in for a table but ended up sitting and staying at the bar. Great experience.",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1084,5,"Really enjoyed our experience here - came on a Sunday afternoon for a snack and a drink. We ordered drinks at the bar because we weren't able to be seated until every single person was there. Somewhat annoying, but also understandable considering how crowded it ended up getting. The bar service was a little slow, but it was EXTREMELY busy. Pricing was reasonable and the drink sizes were fair, although our second round had a few drinks that were like 80% ice which was annoying because they're definitely not cheap.Once we finally sat down we were seated in a booth. This worked out for our group because we were able to make room when two additional people showed up which might not have otherwise been possible since it was really crowded. The booths also had much better lighting than the tables which, on such a crowded day, might have gotten annoying. From what we could tell the tables were lower to the ground but still had people walking by, which can lead to a lot of chair bumping and getting your head knocked with purses etc. So definitely try to get a booth when it's busy! The food itself came out really quickly - we got an order of the crab guacamole which we loved! Really good sized portion and extremely reasonable price. It came with a ton of crab and definitely enough guac. We then ordered the queso dip, which was also awesome. This portion was a bit smaller, but relatively to the price was fair. I definitely wouldn't have minded a bit more. We also really liked it, but it did taste a bit like fake cheese - might have just been the consistency, but if you're picky about cheeses, I wouldn't go with this! However, our group totally didn't mind so we enjoyed it. Kathleen was our waitress and she was awesome. Supper attentive and handled the big crowds really well. She didn't make us feel like we needed to leave even though we were definitely lingering a bit. We will be back!",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1085,5,Very good. Great vibe. Young crowd. Great to watch by tourists. Food was tasty. Crab guacamole had plenty of crab and savory. Shrimp taco and carne asada taco had plenty of ingredients in the taco. Margarita and Paloma were very good and cold Corona.,Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1086,4,"I went to Loco Taqueria for a team dinner based off a suggestion. This restaurant is definitely a must try. In regards to the environment, the restaurant has mood lighting and plays music very loudly - would not suggest if you're trying to talk to your date too much. Otherwise, I was totally into the entire design of the restaurant. The cocktails and margaritas were delicious and super strong! I tried the Britney and the Michael Bivins. The Michael Bivins drink was actually a look to sweet for me. The Britney was definitely a drink I would get again. The food has a lot of flavor. We started with the trio salsas and guacamole appetizers. The salsas were nothing special but the chips and guacamole were really good. We all got tacos and everyone was happy with theirs. I got the carne asada tacos and they were really yummy! I definitely want to go back to try the other cocktails and tacos on the menu!",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1087,4,"TACO TUESDAY @ LOCO: Their tacos that usually cost $5-6 a piece, they were cut down to $2-$3.50 a taco (think 50% off). Â Keep in mind that other people are also aware of this amazing deal, so this place will be packed and noisy. Â We ""vultured"" two spots at the bar after hearing there was a 45 minute wait, and even so there were plenty of people without seats at all, just standing around the bar with their cocktails.Food highlights: *Grilled Street Corn* appetizer, *Baja Fried Fish Taco*, and the *Cola Pork Carnitas Taco.* Â We also tried the Chicken Tinga, Grilled Avocado, and Fried Pork -- would not recommend these.*Grilled Street Corn* is juicy, charred, and sweet, drizzled in a garlic and chili mojo sauce that vaguely reminded me of chipotle mayo but better. Â SO GOOD. Â So sad there were only three (aka I'm too broke to buy more of these.)The *Fish Taco* and *Carnitas Taco* have an excellent ratio of textures and flavors: crunch and juicy; umami and tangy. Â After being very underwhelmed by our first taco (aka the dried mess they call the Pork Taco), the fish taco stood as PERFECTION in contrast -- it's been a while since I've had such a delicate, yet satisfying crunch. Â The carnitas taco was deeply satisfying in flavor; they drew out the umami of the meat and brightened it with sweetness (pineapple salsa), and crunch (mini tortilla chips).IN SUM: I'm pretty satisfied! Â Yes, they are busy, cramped, extremely noisy, and their service exists only in its bare bones (I've heard they're pretty packed on non-promo days too).

Celebrated my husband's birthday this year and thoroughly enjoyed the drinks, music, food and good service. We were given a corner table by the window so that we can accommodate more friends who were gonna join us later for drinks. We stayed until closing hours. We tried a couple of new stuff this time around - the jalapeÃ±o drink - goes well with the guacamole and chips BTW. The watermelon Margarita was an instant hit as well. So was coco. I tried their crispy Cauliflower dish- a tad bit bland but I liked it because I like Cauliflower in general and don't mind less spice for a change ..I can see however, that many people may not enjoy this dish very much because of its slightly bland nature.",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1089,5,The food and margaritas at Loco are to die for!

Being from Texas, we didn't expect much from this place. Yes, the guacamole was overpriced; yes, the tacos are just ok; and yes, it's loud as heck inside; but all that said, damn those coconut margaritas are delicious! Once we embraced this place for what it did well: incredible oyster selection, delicious cocktails, and great fusion tacos (try the asian influenced general tsos taco), this place became a regular haunt!It's only too bad everyone else also knows what a treat it is- the wait never felt less than 45 min on a weekend night, and the hosts are kind of awful.

The staff is also awesome, super friendly and attentive!",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1092,3,"I suspect the kitchen ran out of onions that night... and other mistakes were made. While I feel this place has great potential, these blunders made the experience less than stellar. I started with the Bartender's favorite tequila flight. I was elated to find these came in Glencairn glasses. I am a lover of fine spirits, and these are terrific for nosing and siping. I liked the combination of a Blanco, reposado, and aÃ±ejo tequila, as it allowed for a comparison between the flavors of tequilas aged for different amounts of time. I am typically a whiskey drinker... and I believe good whiskey is whiskey you like to drink; with the same applying to tequila. However, I encourage you to drink it neat; sip it, savor it, enjoy it, but don't shoot it.Then there is a tuna crudo tostada. I loved the combination of textures, there was soft, crunchy, as well as fresh from veggie elements. In terms of flavor, there was way too much lime juice. It was as if someone heavy-handedly squeezed out a lime, twice, or even thrice. Raw tuna has a very mild flavor, and while sauces and dressings can enhance the flavor, in this case, the tuna and everything else was overwhelmed with lime.The Carne Asada tacos were, unfortunately, a miss for me. The steak was overcooked by about 15-30 seconds, but in that time lost some juiciness and tenderness. Also, it was cold, being only a hair and a half above room temperature. A little more seasoning on the meat also wouldn't have hurt either. Still, flavors were good, but the texture is this dishes weak point. The tacos desperately needed something with a little freshness and crunch, such as onions! In terms of portion size, the tacos were piled on with stuff and stayed together surprisingly well, but tortillas themselves were a smaller than I was expecting. Also, be careful of the red peppers, especially if you don't like, or aren't used to a little heat.Still not sated, I gave into temptation and ordered some chips and guacamole. The chips were spectacular, some of the best homemade tortillas I have had. Their thickness was on point, and seasoning level was perfect. Another Yelper mentioned they use a different seasoning depending on what you get. Well, I got a combination of regular salt, something a little sweet, and one or two that were vinegary. All delicious, so I'm not going to give them grief for the three kinds of seasoning, especially since variety is the spice of life. The guacamole was very good also, the only change I would have made is to add some onions! Even that's not it! For my final dish of the day I ordered some duck taquitos. These were the real MVP. Here all the flavors and textures were on point. I loved the crunch of the shell and the softness of the filling. There was also a spectacular play of sweetness and saltiness from the sauces and just the right amount of heat from the filling. The service was a little slow to come up at first, but good cake out fairly quickly after my order was placed. The location is clean! Finally, I recommend coming early to avoid the crowds.",Loco Taqueria and Oyster Bar,"412 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1093,5,"This place was BOMB. My boyfriend and I needed some post drinking fuel and thought Mexican food sounded like a great idea. We unexpectedly stumbled upon this gem and were NOT disappointed. The vibe is very hip, bustling, and has the perfect ambiance for Sunday funday. We were seated immediately even though the entire place was packed which was a huge plus. We ordered beers and the chips and guac to start. Was very impressed with the chips because they were well fried and coated with this incredible chipotle lime dust. The portion of guacamole was also generous and was some of the best I've tasted in a while. We also got tacos: grilled shrimp, carne asada, and chipotle lime chicken. My favorite was the carne asada but each taco held its own. I still tasted the spice from the carne asada taco after we left and wish I'd ordered more.

You could tell it was homemade, the shape was different from fusilli in a box. It was topped with ground meat, simply amazing.I would highly recommend Piattini if you are looking for great Italian food in the Back Bay!",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1124,2,"This restaurant was honestly disappointing. several points 1. The waitress gave us two options for water, neither of which was free but failed to clarify, as we later realized when we looked at the check, which felt like a scam 2. The waitress was very rude from the point on when we said we are not ordering wine. We are college age students, not looking to splurge. It seemed like she couldn't bother to wait our tables because we were not white old patrons, like others at the restaurant. 3. The lobster ravioli was undercooked. We called to have the dish taken in and cooked again for us. The lamb was v good, it's the only thing that even earns this place two stars.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1125,4,"Great location, awesome food, and nice service! I've come here a couple of times and have enjoyed the food for this place. The entrance is a little confusing to get to when you walk down, but the after walking in there's two dining sections and a bar area you could sit it. The menu is pretty simple being split into small and large sized dishes to order. The small numbers to the side of each dish represent the wine they recommend pairing the food with. I ordered the capesante, which the scallops were perfectly cooked, so they weren't too rubbery or too fishy tasting. The slight bitter taste of arugula added a nice touch to the pasta and shredded cheese. If you're craving pasta, I'd recommend coming here to get some!",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1126,3,"I caught up with a friend on Piattini's lovely patio on a surprisingly warm night out in late winter. Â We each ordered two items from the hot small plates menu, including: - Black Truffle Ravioli ($16)- Cranberry and Goat Cheese Ravioli ($12) **- Spinach Gnocchi ($12)Food alone would definitely rank Piattini at four stars. Â I had both of their new hot small plates, and MY GAWD these were phenomenal. Â These are SMALL -- about 4ish ravioli per dish, aka $3-4 per ravioli. Â However, their creativity and BOMB ravioli and their sauces make the sampling worth.I highly recommend the ** Cranberry Goat Cheese Ravioli **. Â The sauce complimented the drier tanginess of the classic cranberry + goat cheese pairing, and it was topped with some sprigs of palate-cleansing arugula. Â As delicious as the Black Truffle Ravioli was, I think the truffle flavor could've been stronger (it was overpowered by the cream sauce).Service: It was a busy night for Piattini, so although we were seated immediately, our service was unfortunately slow. Â It was difficult to catch our waiter's eye from the patio. Â We waited at least 10 minutes just to be SERVED WATER, and at least another 15 minutes before our order was taken. Â They ran out of mushrooms our pasta orders, and they ran out of their complimentary bread later that night, so I think they were understaffed both in the kitchen and on the floor. Â Thank goodness I had a lovely dinner partner to converse with during those waits!IN SUM: Take a gander at this place! Â I imagine it must be lovely when they are not swarmed by people trying to get a breath of fresh air on an unseasonably warm day in the middle of winter. Â I'd definitely try this place again later in the spring. Â ** And do try to get a spot on the patio **, because sitting under the night sky and next to the twinkling trees of Newbury Street is so charming :3",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1127,5,"I came here for an early, light dinner before going to see a concert. We were greeted and seated by a lovely waiter. He explained the menu very clearly (the numbers next to the dishes correspond to wine recommendations) and was very charming throughout. As we were there around 6 pm, there were very few people in the restaurant, mostly people at the bar. The waiter gave us good recommendations, and everything we ordered was made perfectly. My we ordered the Spinach Salad, Melanzane Affumicate and Burrata Ravioli with Truffle Cream and Fried Eggplant. I also had a delicious Negroni to go with the meal. It was just a really stellar experience on the tastebud level.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1128,3,"Location is great, in the middle of Newberry and in the midst of lots of stores/quaint restaurants. Â I judge Italian restaurants by the quality of their pasta noodles. Â Their noodles did not taste fresh...similar to buying something from a market and boiling it at home. Â Service was okay.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1129,4,"This place is fantastic. Great service and food. They are known for their small plates. Good mix hot and cold. 3 plates will really fill you up. Had the lobster ravioli, lamb chops (3) and scallops. All very delicious. Split between 3 of us. Veal Saltimbaco was my entree. Good preparation made with Marsala wine.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1130,2,Low quality Italian food. Poor service.

Service was great, atmosphere was great, and the lunch menu was suuuuuper affordable. Will definitely be going back.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1134,3,"3 stars because the bartender was friendly and made a delicious Alba Siciliana cocktail. The rye and luxardo liquor with blood orange was delicious. The food, however, was bland. The service was fast and the pasta was hot... but that's about it. I got penne pomodoro thinking it's simple and hard to mess up. It's telling if a restaurant can do this well... well, I was less than impressed. The penne was cooked al dente but the sauce tasted like a store could've made. There was nothing special. Plus, if you're going to say basil on the menu, there better be basil in the dish. Nope. The menu is setup as small plates vs regular dishes. The small plates were rather pricy, and it was hard to figure out the size. Maybe I just didn't get the concept or ordered the wrong thing, but it was nothing special. Some of the small plates looked flavorful and unique but without being able to figure out the size even after asking and deciding if one would be enough (multiple for one person could get pricey!), I opted for a pasta entree... who knows if I'd have had a better experience ordering something else. Great location and outdoor setting, with a few occupied tables. I sat at the bar inside... inside was empty apart from myself and one other table.",Piattini,"226 Newbury St Boston, MA 02116"1135,4,"What a nice accidental find this was. We were early for reservations around the corner at Moonshine 152 and trying to find a place to have a quick drink. We only did a really quick Google search and were delighted to walk into this beautiful pub. Lots of exposed brick, cool light fixtures, and a big, long bar with plenty of space (it was pretty early).The wonderful surprises continued when I looked over the beer menu and saw at least 3 Trillium beers on draft - mind blown. We were visiting from Portland and despite having plenty of beer-centric bars, Trillium on draft is still a pretty big deal. Turned out they had kicked one, not that it mattered to me as long as one was on, and of course they had some other really good beer offerings as well. I was too busy taking photos of my beer to make friends jealous to remember what my girlfriend got for a cocktail but she loved it. They did have some pretty creative cocktails in my very humble opinion. As mentioned, there was food waiting for us around the corner at Moonshine but what we saw coming out of the kitchen at Worden Hall looked fantastic. What a great neighborhood bar. We'll definitely be back for some food to go with their impressive beer list.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1136,5,Amazing experience here tonight! Got sent over from the sister restaurant Five Horses since they were closed for electrical issues. The service by Kyle our waiter was phenomenal!Friendly and fast with good recommendations.Food was equally great. I got the nyc strip with veggies. Steak was perfectly cooked and the veggies were fresh and delicious. My girlfriend got the amazing pork buns and some very good broccoli rabe I'm hot oil. The pool boy cocktail was also very inventive and delicious.Free blueberry cobbler not even on the menu for us for making the trip out of our way. We will be back! Thanks also to Ben the manager,Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1137,5,"We ate there recently during the busy graduation weekend and arrived just as the horse races started, so service was well under way.The Service:Our waitress kept our drinks topped off and was very knowledgable of the wine/beer selection. She was familiar with the food selections as well, and was able to give personal recommendations which is always a great sign (when the staff eat there too!). The manager, Dan, stopped by to greet the tables and we had a great conversation with him (not your typical ""how was the food?"" talk). At times when you could tell the kitchen was getting busy, other wait staff would check on us to make sure the experience was smooth and uninterrupted.The Food:We started off this time with three appetizers; the harissa lamb meatballs, crab cakes, and the chicken wings. The lamb was cooked perfectly; not too gamey, and with the right amount of yogurt and cheese. The crab was phenomenal; soft on the inside, with the right amount of crisp on the out-- definitely NOT over-fried like a lot of other places. The chicken wings were juicy and plump-- not like those tiny meat lollipops you see at other joints. Truth be told, we were kinda nervous we ordered too much food because they were very generous with the portions.For the main courses, we ordered the salmon, NY strip steak, and the scallops.The salmon was flaky and juicy; the accompanying pea puree (something we've never tried) was an unexpected treat that paired very well with the fish.I tried to throw the kitchen a loop by ordering my steak RARE-- something that a lot of places either end up overcooking, or giving to you raw; Worden did not disappoint. That baby was juicy, red, RARE, yet cooked. You could literally pull it apart with your fingers it was so tender. They still got an awesome crisp on the outside. By far my favorite of the three entrees. The scallops were masterfully cooked; not rubbery at all, yet they had a nice firm texture. The brussel sprouts and pancetta that came with them could have been an entree on its own. That was definitely the sleeper hit of the dinner.I'm on a diet, so I skipped the dessert, but to be honest the food was so filling, would have been hard to squeeze in anyway. This place is one of my favorites in Boston; it hits hard at those comfort food soft spots I have, and going there during the winter time or just a rainy day totally nails the aesthetic they're trying to achieve. We will definitely be back!",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1138,3,"If location is everything in real estate, it's only part of the thing in restaurants. Worden Hall has a great location, if you're tied to the Red Line. You come out of the T at Broadway and there it is. Directly across the street. Very close. Imagine meeting friends during a snowstorm. No trudging through slush or scaling snowbanks. It's right there. So civilized. The drawback is that the food is just okay and often uneven, just like the service. At the tables, it feels like a chain. Think Applebees or Average Joe's, and that's not meant as a slam to either of those. Sometimes they're just what you want but you never go there expecting culinary excitement. You just get food, sometimes better than others. The bar is beautiful, long and clean and comfy and spacious and constructed out of thousand and one shellacked pennies. It stirs the imagination. Who did this? How? I like sitting there. And the beer selection is pretty extensive. But the food comes from the same kitchen as the food at the tables. It's meh. Uneven. It should be amazing. It's not. I will definitely go back for beer with friends. I'll go for conversation and convenience. I won't expect much from the food. I'll probably be happy.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1139,4,"The soppressata and sausage deep dish pizza is amazing! My mom had the short rib grilled cheese with a choice of fries, side salad or half and half! They have lots of vegan options and very happily accommodating to allergies. We sat in a cozy booth along the front wall. Great atmosphere and it wasn't crowded on Sunday at 6pm. (visited 7/8/18)",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1140,3,"Chose this place for breakfast yesterday based on an eclectic menu and Â photos of the environment, plus great Yelp reviews. We walked over a mile to get there from our hotel. We didn't need to make a reservation, we were one of five parties in the place, but we did, because it was brunch time, and you never know in the city.It really does have a cool atmosphere, sort of an old world feel. The waitress was nice, but completely botched our order. She seem distracted while she was taking it down. I ordered a meal that came with eggs any style, but she never asked me what kind I wanted. When it became evident that she was not going to, I said ""Can I get my eggs that come with that scrambled?"" She told me that she would have to check on that. The meal came with a charred tomato, and I specifically asked not to have one included. Hot tomatoes disgust me, personal preference. 15 minutes later, our breakfasts arrived, and one of them was a breakfast sandwich, which Neither of us had not ordered. Everyone was seemingly confused, but they must have found our original order, because the correct meals came out 15 minutes later. (The charred tomato was not omitted on mine.) Sadly, I think my husband's never got remade, I think it sat there while they made what I had originally ordered, because his scrambled eggs were cold. At that point, we didn't want to send anything back, because time was now an issue, and we didn't want to make the waitress, who did come over and apologize, feel worse. After we ate, we sat there for an extended period of time, and had to ask the waitress for our check, even though we had indicated we were all set. I am going with some charitable assumption, and think she may be new. Some kinks to work out there. It's a limited menu, so I recommend getting to know it well.The food was decent, we would maybe consider giving it a try for dinner at some point, but overall not as praiseworthy as we were led to believe from fellow Yelpers.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1141,3,Went here for brunch this past weekend with 8 people. We did make a reservation but there were plenty of open tables. It was raining though. The mimosa flight was the best part. 3 stars because no one really liked their meal. Waffles and breakfast sandwich were soggy. Mac and cheese was drenched in liquid cheese. The donut holes were tasty! Probably wouldn't return here.,Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1142,4,"We stopped in for a Saturday night dinner and got right in around 8 PM. We got our drink orders in and they were quickly delivered. In a bit of an oddity we had one person take our drink order, another deliver it, and then a third server show up to take our food order. The third server stuck with us the rest of the night, but there was no explanation as to why we had the revolving door series of servers - we didn't take it personally; might have just been shift change.Anyhow...I opted for the Cheesesteak, which was very flavorful and quite delicious. I opted for the fresh green salad option and it was packed full of dark greens and had a nice light dressing-wonderful overall. My wife got a nightly special Fall Pappardelle. It was pretty good, with delightfully plump and tasty pearl onions, but was a bit buttery for her taste although there was a good mix of ingredients.Service was good, even/because? of the rotating servers, and prices were very reasonable.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1143,4,"This is the place I choose to celebrate my 23rd birthday with a couple friends. Got off to a terrific start, but unfortunately, the awesomeness did not carry through my whole experience. Because of some logistics, I got here around an hour before we had agreed to meet, so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered an Old Fashioned, and some Pork Buns. The Old Fashioned was very strong. If you are not a fan of whiskey, then this one is definitely not for you. The drink was made with Bulleit, which I am not a fan of... however, to his credit, the bartender did give me a choice, I just told him ""your preference"".Pork Buns were spectacular all around, but be warned, there are jalapeÃ±os in there, so they come with quite a kick! Anyways, the pork belly was great, I liked that they were tender enough to melt in your mouth, but also preserved some of that friend/grilled flavor. The sauce was delightfully savory, and tangy, rather than a run-of-the-mill saccharine BBQ sauce. The vegetable slaw added a wonderful crunch. I devoured these with great joy.Bar service was pretty nice, although I must say before 5:30 the bar was close to capacity, but there was only one bartender. The crowd wasn't too demanding, and service was relatively quick considering there was one bartender running the show. Not to worry, It wasn't one person the whole night, as two more came in at 5:30.Fast forward a little bit, my friends are all here and we are ordering food! For an appetizer, we ordered the chicken wings. These were middle-of-the-road. They were cooked pretty well, and they had a great amount of BBQ sauce on them, enough to add flavor, not so much that you need 32 napkins to clean up afterward. My critique here is that the bleu cheese was extremely chunky. Because of how everything was plated, I ended up just grabbing a rather large piece of bleu cheese. Let me tell you... bleu cheese is great with wings or celery, but not on its own! Then came the pulled pork sandwich... after the pork buns, I was excited to try this! I was expecting the same range of flavors, with softness and crunch, sugar and spice, and everything nice... alas, I was denied. There were several things that caused this break-down. First, the cabbage slaw did not add any noticeable crunch. Not only was it not crunchy, there wasn't very much of it either. The pulled pork was overcooked and rather dry, desperately needing some more sauce. On a positive note, the bread was very pleasant! The curly fries were delicious too, cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. Then, there's the grand finale of the ice cream sandwich, which we split amongst the table. This one was also middle of the road. While there was some peanut-y sauce and candied peanuts, the ice cream didn't read as peanut butter to me, nor did I get a heavy reading on salted caramel. I should mention that I didn't see this listing on the dessert menu (server just told us ""ice cream sandwich""), but I would hope to be able to pick up on it.Overall service was nice and fairly attentive, although as it got a little later in the evening, it took a little while to get the food out, quite a bit longer than it took the pork buns... but then again, two of my friends ordered burgers, and those take a bit to cook.  It was the baos that showed me this places potential, which was why the sandwich was such a disappointment. But, they also showed what it is capable of, and that it could have just been a couple misfires. This said, I look forward to returning at some point and giving them another shot!",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1144,4,"Good brunch spot.

We got a side of home fries that we're good but over priced for the size. Both plates we got were portioned small. We got the Saratoga French Toast and the Huevos Rancheros Tacos. There were 2 pieces of French toast and 2 tacos. Both were very tasty but small portions. The French Toast was very filling but over priced for the amount you get.Overall: good atmosphere.

We were very pleased with the food and felt all the chicken dishes we got was very thick and meaty. The chicken and waffles, that chicken was a little dry versus the buttermilk chicken which was not as dry. And for the chicken wings was wonderful but the blue cheese like the ranch dressing should be on the side instead of poured all over the chicken. I didn't mind it but not everyone likes blue cheese.

What an incredibly frustrating and disappointing brunch here yesterday.Myself and a few friends had brunch reservations for 12:15. When we arrived we were told they were just busing our table and we'd be able to sit shortly. At 12:40 we were finally seated, so clearly that was a lie and they didn't want to admit they just seat people and don't respect reservations. Meanwhile the hostess was not only unapologetic but shockingly cold and apathetic. Not at all the warm welcome you expect from such a highly rated spot. We were finally seated in the very back of the restaurant and proceeded to only see our server occasionally. She was fairly quick to take drink orders, but then disappeared for 20 minutes before coming back to ask about food.Drinks were very yummy but a bit odd in pricing and sizes. The regular mimosa is only $4 which is a steal, but the bellini that's the same size as the mimosa is $9 and the jumbo mimosa (also $9) is enormous. I just don't understand how they determine prices. You really don't know what you're getting until you order. I also had a cappuccino which was small and not that great. Not terrible by any means, but no better than you'd get at a chain coffee shop.The menu was super impressive and there were so many things I was interested in trying. Unfortunately food took AN HOUR to arrive. 20 minutes after we ordered the waitress came by to tell us that the kitchen was really backed up and she didn't know how long it would take for our food. She apologized, but that was it. No offer of a comped round of drinks while we waited (we ended up ordering a second round just cause we had so much time to kill) or a side or something to munch on while we wait. We were all insanely hungry by the time food finally arrived. Some kind of token gesture of ""hey, we're really fucking up right now and we're so sorry"" would have made the insane wait more palatable. It was completely unacceptable. When it finally arrived the food was delicious. J had the omelet and loved it. I opted for the fried chicken sandwich which, while not my favorite ever, was still pretty great. Can't go wrong with fried chicken. As a bonus, it comes with fries or greens and they'll let you do half and half if you want. Love when places are okay with that. E had the mac and cheese with pork belly which, while fabulous, was a pretty small serving size considering it was comparably priced to other menu items. Like the drinks, you just don't know what you're getting when you order. Let's recap: 12:15 reservation. 12:40 seated. 2PM WE FINALLY GET FOOD.It was absurd. Yummy as the food was, there's too many tasty brunch spots in Boston to ever give this place even a passing second glance.",Worden Hall,"22 W Broadway Boston, MA 02127"1155,5,"One of our fav places in the neighborhood. We love this place. They change their draft beer menu pretty often, it is fun to try new beer every single time we go here. They have so many different beer!! Beer flight is a good way to try different ones. 1. Starters: pretzel is amazing! It comes out soft and hot, great with beer cheese and mustard. Wings are so good as well.2. Salad: fried chicken salad is my fav. Their fried chicken is very delicious.3. Main: interestingly their tacos are better than many Mexican restaurants. Fried chicken sammy is always delicious. Their burger is a must-try. With tater totes, it is incredible. KFCGH: very nice fried chicken with mash potato and mac & cheese but it is not the most healthy dish obviously. We really enjoyed yellow curry too. Very flavorful (but very spicy). The only dish I was not overwhelmed was duck burrito, it was a bit too salty for me. Overall, the quality of food, beer and services is amazing. We love the vibes as well. Such a gem in the neighborhood!",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1156,3,"It's a great place to come for a nice, greasy brunch and some good cocktails. It's one of those places where they don't do it all well because they try and do everything, but they have their specialties. To Order: Mimosa Flight (if you haven't been told already)- a beautiful rainbow of decently portioned cocktails!I was not too impressed by my power bowl, which said it came with sesame tofu but that part didn't make the cut apparently... It was just some nuts and bagged spinach. Next time I know to get something heavier and greasier, like the Heart Surgeon (which my boyfriend ordered). It had hash, eggs, onions, and was topped with biscuits.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1157,3,"There are a lot of great things about Five Horses Tavern. The mimosa flight was innovative and fun to order. There were four - one similar to your classic mimosa but more acidic which I liked, a lime ish flavored one which I thought was just okay, a fresh strawberries one which I liked as much as the classic, and a red one that I literally could not figure out what it was but I did not like it. $18 for a mimosa flight wasn't a terrible flight given that a mimosa typically goes for $10.My boyfriend ordered the Southern Chicken (2 large biscuits, 2 fried chicken and 2 eggs over gravy). The biscuits were tasty, but so dense and I couldn't even eat more than 1/3 of one. Eggs and gravy were decent. The fried chicken, however, was the most conflicting piece for me. The outside was so well seasoned and tasty, but because there is a lot of chicken, it was fairly dry - even the gravy was not enough to offset the dryness. I ordered the Breakfast Club (essentially chicken club with waffles instead of toast). The Breakfast Club comes with a side and we got tater tots for that, then ordered another larger side of beef & pork belly hash. The Breakfast Club was very difficult to eat (see pictures) but the hot sauce on there stood out the most for me. The weirdest concept though is to put the hot sauce all the way on the top of the club and the chicken was all the way on the bottom. They would have been great together. The tater tots were spiced well and the beef and pork belly hash had such a great texture - but I did not taste much potato and it was salty.Probably would not come back for brunch, but would like to come for the beer flights as I saw many beers on tap at the bar!",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1158,2,"Came here with my boyfriend during my birthday trip to Boston after reading mostly good reviews on Yelp. It took 20 minutes to get a table, but we were able to get a nice table outside on a beautiful day and a view of the sunset. My boyfriend ordered the beer flight ($15) and I a peach pale ale ($6.50). We also ordered the bottomless cupcakes - chocolate cupcakes filled with cream cheese filling and paired with passion fruit coulis ($8). Sounds delicious right? Wrong. I was in the mood for dessert and the cupcakes we received were nowhere near ""filled"" with any sort of filling. They were empty, small, and the coulis was just some type of drizzle on the plate. The concept of this dessert could've been great, but this place failed to deliver. My pale ale was really good, but when the waitress brought the 4 beer flight out to our table, she managed to SPILL IT ALL OVER MY BOYFRIEND. So she apologizes and gets a towel, comes back and wipes down the table while my boyfriend is standing there, soaked, with nothing to wipe down. She then proceeds to offer him the towel she JUST USED to wipe the table down and says (I kid you not) that the towel is clean and dry and he can use it to wipe himself down if he'd like. My boyfriend handled the situation well but the waitress handled her mistake pretty badly. She brought out the flight again and placed it on the table the same exact way she did the first time. Given, our table was slanted because it was outside but she put the flight tray parallel to the slant so of course it's going to fall! Basic physics!!!Anyway, we asked for the manager and he gladly comped the beer flight, but the waitress was pretty measly and unaware. She was a bit rude too when we tried to make light of the situation...Anyway, 2 stars for this place because the quality of the dessert was subpar, but the atmosphere is nice. Won't be back.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1159,2,"Meh. Disappointed and conflicted lunch puppy. This is actually an update of my previous review, which also had 2 stars. My last experience, the food was very good, but the service was really really slow and terrible. Today I went for lunch with a friend, we got there at 12:00 pm ordered 2 avocado tacos and a French Kiss pizza. The food took FOREVER to come in. We finally got it at around 12:40 pm and GOBBLED it because we were starving and had to be back to work at 1 pm. So still disappointed with the service.On the other hand, â€‹if you are here the French Kiss pizza is very very good! The avocado tacos are pretty good as well. I wish they cooked the corn tortillas more, but it was a good meal.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1160,5,The food was so good. My Mom and I stared with sharing mimosa flight. Then we shared the french toast sticks. Â Now these were not your average french toast sticks... these were elevated and we loved them. Then I had a nice lighter option of a tofu bowl... very good also - perfect after heavier french toast sticks.

The menu has great variety but I felt theirâ€‹ food was lacking quality. We tried their tacos and they didn't seem all that fresh or tasty. I got the O.D.B and it was just okay. There was a ton of food on the plate but it just didn't work for me. The pulledâ€‹ pork was dry and the biscuit was hard. I liked their homefriesâ€‹ and tater tots - you can't really mess that up though. And finally - the mimosa flights look great on Instagramâ€‹ but the just flavors were just okay. Our waitress visited the table like twice. Five Horses Tavern is just an average place for brunch.,Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1162,3,"Review for the cocktails -Basically they sound a lot tastier on paper than they did in real life. My two friends and I all got different libations, and although I liked mine the best (a spicy tequila), I was very unimpressed by the others. I wish I remembered what they were called, but they essentially reminded me of a watered down juice with soda and a splash of alcohol. Maybe it was the bartender? Who knows. The vibe was cool and there were a lot of people around, so I have no doubt that this place has some great stuff to offer...but next time I would probably stick with beer or wine.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1163,4,"Five Horses is really close by and a great place to go when you don't want to ponder for hours where to go. I'd recommend making a reservation on the weekends through OpenTable to avoid wait times.During the summer, they have a patio and is great for people watching and enjoying a nice pitcher of sangria. I'm giving four stars as the last two times (of the hundreds visited) there wasn't great service and food was cold. However, this was truly the first and second time this has happened in the past five years I've been going here.  We ordered the oxtail chili, cornbread and roasted chicken. All of which normally is fantastic but served room temperature/semi-cold this time around. I'd recommend the Mac n cheese, pizzas and kale salad for when you go in! Definitely a great place to try.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1164,4,"This is THE place for an indulgent and unique brunch. I came around 11am with a pal and there wasn't a long wait. I had so much trouble choosing between three different options on the menu - a fried chicken and biscuit number, a pulled pork Benedict, and a brunch pizza with a baked egg and hollandaise sauce. I mean, all of these sounded sooo drool-worthy!In the end, I went for the pulled pork Benny and have no regrets. The pork was tender with some crispy bits and the eggs were large and yolky. What more could I ask for? My friend got the burger and also enjoyed it. We left incredibly stuffed but also very happy.In addition, our server was super friendly and gave some good guidance on what to order. The ambience is like your classic old timer tavern, and we got a bar seat facing the window to do a bit of people watching as we munched. I will be back since that brunch pizza is still playing on my mind!",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1165,4,"Had a really great time here. I went a few months ago with my boyfriend for lunch and we loved our dishes. I ordered the curry entree and a veggie taco as an appetizer - both were delicious! My boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger with tater tots and the tots were incredible! Burger was also juicy and well seasoned. We both ordered the Garden Mule and they were great. Not too strong, and the cucumber and basil were great additions. They have wonderful gluten free and vegetarian options, which I always appreciate in a restaurant. I would love to come here again (only reason I gave 4 stars was because I have only been here once) for brunch or dinner! Lovely spot in the South End.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1166,3,"Brunch is my favorite meal so I have high expectations.. but I thought this place was average! The menu sounded really good but the actual food was okay. I got the heart surgeon, which the waitress recommended to me. The beef and pork hash were too well cooked for my taste. The edges of my skillet were burnt by some of the meat. My toast was also burnt. This is probably not a reflection of all the heart surgeons that they serve, but my particular dish was definitely over cooked. Also, the service was good but slow. It took awhile for our dishes to come out and it was not that busy that particular Saturday morning. However, I'm still interested in giving them another chance next time.

The prices are very affordable for how much food you get, but be warned - there are very few ""light"" or ""healthy eating"" dishes. You can certainly order mesclun greens or the black bean hash as sides, but most of the food is sausage/fried chicken/bacon/delicious cheddar grits. I actually only ate the cheddar grits side for breakfast and was completely full, even though I'd also ordered the Heart Surgeon. Be warned, the heart surgeon is EXTREMELY heavy, with no vegetables in sight. It was delicious the next day, but was so big and heavy that I made it into 2 meals. We also ordered the donut holes for the table, which were perfectly fried but not too heavy. And we've also heard great things about the drinks although we didn't partake in them.

Â We ordered apps to share, including both plain and loaded tater tots (since when did this become grown-up food?), chicken wings, and soft pretzels. Â The food was very average - not bad, but definitely not remarkable in any way. Â I would have loved to see a vegetable in there somewhere, but the group I was with was not really into that so maybe I'll have to come back to try the brussels sprouts, elote, ""pea diddy"" etc. Â On the other hand, the drink selection was pretty excellent, with a wide range of styles from craft breweries including both local (Night Shift, Trillium) and not-so local (Founders, Green Flash) favorites. Â At first I was impressed by the relatively low draft prices, but it seems they pour 8 oz rather than 12 so it pretty much evens out.This place has great atmosphere, on a picturesque street corner in the south end, with sidewalk seating and large open windows - a prime spot to spend a summer evening with friends. Â They do take table reservations, which I would recommend for groups. Â It's also worth noting that our service was very good. Â We had a pretty large group, and were somewhat disorganized when it came to ordering, paying, etc, but our waiter handled everything superbly, with great skill and courtesy.

The brunch is okay, kinda an odd menu, so check it out before you go in. I've had the chimichanga, which was good but definitely out of the ordinary. The tater tots are out of this world. I would recommend it more for lunch or dinner because the menu is a little more normal without being boring. I have had the burger which was good. It's a good spot if you don't have a reservation because I've never seen it super crowded and they can usually accommodate a larger party. Nothing is out of this world but its a solid place if you're in the area.",Five Horses Tavern,"535 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1173,4,"We live right around the corner from this nice more upscale tavern. We ate here once in the fall and just recently for Valentine's Day. We really enjoyed the food and I think the beer selection is really nice. Also great service both times and relaxed atmosphere. We had the calamari special which was very tasty. Then I ordered the Mac and cheese on the waitress's recommendation, with pulled pork. My wife had the burger which I ate half of. Overall we enjoyed both meals but I wasn't blown away by the Mac and cheese. It was heavy on the cheese and light on the pork. I would've preferred a better balance but I still enjoyed it. The burger was very delicious and well prepared. The beer selection (see pics) was solid and they charge about $3 more for a trillium than you buy in a can so I gotta say that ain't bad.

At first I was thrown off by the French names of the classic asian dishes. It was $33 for a three course meal. APPETIZER: I ordered the Chilled Avocado Citrus Soup which was unbelievably refreshing. Perfect balance of all the flavors. My friend got the Rouleaux which is basically a spring roll and she said it was very delicious. She got the mushroom substitute. ENTREE: you cannot go wrong with the grilled rainbow trout! All the elements of the dish complemented each other so perfectly - from the jasmine rice, to the Chinese broccoli, to the spicy marinade! The fish was also very well done. DESSERT: You have to get the coconut milk custard. DELICIOUS! I would come back for this alone!! The description had squash in it which I thought was a little strange but it worked so well with the coconut custard. Overall: from just reading the menu, I was truthfully a little skeptical. I thought it was just going to be like a regular asian place with French names. They also had this Mango Sticky Rice as an option but named it something way different. This is one of those places that will blow your expectations out of the water. Definitely give it a try!",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1176,1,"Overpriced. Americanized. Slow.I was really looking forward to dinner at elephant walk, as I remembered 5+ years ago they had the best Cambodian food, and an amazing b'baw mouan soup. Now the restaurant is overpriced, and tastes nothing like authentic Cambodian.Starters:Rouleaux (pork) - this dish is clumsily deep fried, similar to a Chinese take out egg roll. The filling lacked flavor and needed the sauce, which was too sweet.Dumplings (pork) - $8 for 6 small dumplings, this was similarly deep fried and diaappointingRouleaux (tuna) - this was good, bright flavors, tuna and avocado tasted very freshB'baw mouan (chicken) - this was super disappointing and overwhelmingly sweet. There was no balance of flavor - It is supposed to taste like garlic, shallots, fresh herbs, lime, chicken base.Entrees:Khar saiko kroeng (beef noodle) - this tasted like a Chinese beef noodle dish, except with a lot of sugar / sweetness added. The beef is good, but every bite tastes of sweet beef broth.Kari tieh (duck noodle) - the duck was braised well, and the dish has a relatively unique flavor.We had 7 people but I did not try the other entrees.Overall the food here has gone down in quality and flavor, yet they can charge a higher price because there is no other Cambodian food around. Dinner with 1 sangria came out to $55/person, and it's honestly it's not worth the price.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1177,5,"Great food and great service. This place deserves more attention!I've come here twice and I've been impressed with everything that I've tried. I would highly recommend starting off with an order of their spring rolls... The ones here are very different from the typical fast food spring roll you may be thinking of.Can't go wrong with any of the entrees, but my personal favorite is the loc lac. The meat is so tender and flavor packed.If you're looking for something sweet, definitely end with their flourless chocolate cake. It is so rich and creamy- definitely a unique dessert. Overall, I highly recommend this place. It is more under the radar so it does not get as crowded as other places around Boston either.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1178,4,"Finally got to try out this place and it did not disappoint! Â I'm not familiar with French Cambodian cuisine so I cannot confirm its authenticity, but I can definitely confirm its tastiness and creativity. I ordered two of the appetizers for a meal because there were so many good options. Would definitely come back to try more! Â Settled on: **Polenta Et Canard BraisÃ© Aux Champignons** (duck polenta, $13) and **Nataing** (coconut ground pork and crispy rice, $10). Â Thankfully, there were helpful English translations of what these dishes were for my ignorant American self ~ 100% would order the duck polenta again. I especially appreciated the shredded raw snow peas on top. Their perfect crisp texture and freshness complemented this savory and creamy dish wonderfully. As for the coconut ground pork and crispy rice, the meat/sauce-y portion was wonderfully balanced and comforting, but it felt disjointed when combined with the crispy rice. Portions were off between the two, and the rice bars didn't take to the sauce well and vice versa. It just didn't go. For my drink, I got the **Amalfi 75** ($12) because I am partial to gin cocktails. Â It was good, could've been stronger for my tastes. Â Their cocktail menu is phenomenal in general, featuring both classics and original works, and even adapting some regulars with French Cambodian flair.

The sourdough bread with oil comes as a complimentary meal. The bread was fresh and tasted good. We ordered Rouleaux Dinner (vegetarian) - these are Cambodia. spring rolls which has to be stuffed between lettuce, basil,bell pepper and radish. The server will explain you if you are a first time eater. For entrees, we ordered Kari Tieh- duck with shanghai noodles. It tasted similar to a thai soup but with bold flavors. Second, we ordered from their feature menu- chicken and rice dish with syrupy sauce. Their feature menu changes with the season. The next change will occur on Thursday (7/12/2018). This was their spring to summer menu collection.

They offer French and Cambodian inspired dishes and flavors and mark vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options on their menu. I came here for my friend's birthday dinner and it was Dine Out Boston week by coincidence. While some of my friends opted to order a la carte, I decided to go for the prefixe menu, which was set at three courses for $33. I ordered the mussels, Porc au Caramel, and a coconut milk custard. The mussels were cooked in garlic, scallion, jalapeno, and red peppers. It lacked a kick but was still tasty. I regretted not ordering the Rouleaux, which is their signature crispy Cambodian pork spring rolls. The Porc au Caramel was slow-cooked pork in a caramelized broth with mushrooms, black pepper, garlic, and peanuts and served with rice. The pork was definitely tender and delicious, but didn't wow me. I enjoyed the coconut milk custard at the end. It was delightfully light. I personally was kind of underwhelmed by my experience at Elephant Walk, especially after reading glowing reviews. However, my friend, who was celebrating her birthday, loved her food (she ordered the Rouleaux to share with another friend and Loc Lac). My friends enjoyed the drinks and were surprised by the strength of the alcohol in them. Some dishes lacked the spice that was promised, which disappointed us. Overall, the Elephant Walk was a pleasant place for dinner (good but not particularly remarkable). Again, I would recommend it for the diets they can accommodate for. No one needs to sacrifice or be excluded to keep a group happy. The prices are a bit steep for what they serve in my opinion, but there are some gems. And they have a good bar.",The Elephant Walk,"1415 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1182,3,"I've had Cambodian food before in super casual homey settings. But Elephant Walk is next-level fancy Cambodian food with a super heavy French influence! We ordered the Loc Lac and the Seared Tofu Curry. The Loc Lac was CRAZY tender. I've had a lot of beef in my life (and veal too), but never one so ridiculously soft. It actually dissolves in your mouth in smoothness with little/no chewing work needed. It was honestly a bit foreign to me how amazingly tender it was! Flavor-wise, the dish was yummy. The Loc Lac tasted very authentic and comparable to the Vietnamese version I grew up eating. Saucy with subtle kicks of garlic - it went great with the accompanying white rice!The Seared Tofu curry was also flavorful and simple. It was a little small in portion but came with a variety of squash and mushrooms to give you a nice mixture of textures.Overall, the meal was tasty, but I wouldn't say I was blown away by the flavor.

My friends who are gluten free swear by this place and it's one of their favorite go to spots. The inside is spacious with a lot of tables and a large bar area. The food is delicious French and Cambodian fusion with all the food filled with lots of flavor. The dumplings were delicious with a crispy crust instead of the normal soft or fried outside.

Let me tell you: this place did not disappoint. The ambiance is calm and comfortable, and the space has plenty of seating. My daughter made a reservation, and we showed up a few minutes late but the staff was nice and didn't seem to mind. For appetizers, we had the Rouleaux (pork spring rolls) and a seasonal noodle dish of which I do not remember the name. Both were tasty. We liked the noodles more, but the technique of eating the rolls was something new to the both of us. You wrap the rolls in lettuce, add bean sprouts in the mix and dip the entire thing into the sauce. Yummy!!For entrees, I had the Loc Lac (delicious!) because I wanted to try something traditional. My daughter had the seasonal shrimp and noodle dish, which I liked too! The restaurant was short staffed, and there was only one man who was working as a server and a host. He did a perfect job.

The broth mixed with garlic, scallion and Asian basil with a hint of spice from jalapeno was amazing. The desserts also were a homerun - we enjoyed the coconut milk custard with Kabocha squash and the passion fruit mousse in the almond lace cup.Food Let Downs - Most other dishes really lacked flavor. The pork belly spring rolls were the most flavorless pork dish we've ever tasted. When we received the entrees, the Shrimp Malika had an amazing sauce, but the shrimp itself lacked much any of any flavor. Additionally, we were turned off of the Poc au Caramel due to the soggy peanuts were also soggy which did not provide the meal with a great texture. We've been excited to try this place for a while but we were disappointed with the lack of flavor in most dishes.

We were starving, so we decided to adventure down Washington and find another spot. When we saw the Cambodian/French fusion menu, we decided to pop in and I am so happy about that decision.The restaurant ambiance is perfect. Not gimmicky, classy and simple. We sat at the bar and ordered anything that looked good. Drinks were spot on and well-mixed, and there was a very decent beer selection. House-infused vodkas, top-shelf liquors and some rare flavors like fig and orange infused whiskey made for some interesting and tasty mixed drinks that I haven't seen anywhere else.For dinner, we ordered dumplings, spring rolls and the pork belly special. We split the green papaya salad with shrimp, and I got the short ribs and he ordered the catfish. Every dish was perfectly cooked and spiced. The compliment of flavors, especially in that salad, were spot on. My short ribs were tender and the sauce they were cooked in was so delicately spiced and flavorful. The papaya salad blew me away. I want the recipe for that dressing! My partner's catfish was perfectly cooked, flaky and crunchy on the crust. The fish itself had a nice light flavor. The heat on everything was a slow-build, but we were provided complimentary hot sauced that layered on the spice, if desired. The food was elegantly plated and professionally presented. I have no complaints at all. It was the fanciest and most delicious Cambodian food I've ever had.Our bartender was very friendly, service was prompt and attentive. If I am in the area, my partner and I will absolutely be back. They seem to rotate the menu a lot, which is exciting for someone who likes to have their taste buds challenged and doesn't rely on routine. If you're someone who relies on ""the usual"" when they come into a restaurant, that might be annoying to you or a deterrent, but this place is so worth being a bit adventurous in your eating.

This restaurant is right across from Cathedral high. Once you've gotten in, you'll see that large parties are NOT a great idea. Thusly any table size over 6 needs to have a reservation Â - because their tables can barely seat 4. Tight quarters aside, you'll find this to be a very relaxing, well decorated , exposed brick of an interior that is quite cozy warm in the colder months. Â It is French Cambodian but the atmosphere leans toward a southeast asian and modern contemporary feel. Not cliche at all actually, but very elegant without being pretentious. Gold elephants, red velvet and wood. Most of the dishes can be ordered in a appetizer size or full meal size. I love this anywhere I see it. Also makes for a great night out of sampling, almost like tapas.. except not al all lol. For a family member's b day , we had a lovely array of foods from dumplings, to salads, duck with polenta, Â salmon and classic beef bourginon. Â All of them were plentiful, sumptuously seasoned, and FRESH in all the ingredients. Skip the green salad unless you hae a case of scurvy and need leafy greens - its just that, nothing more. Save tummy real estate for the Beef Short ribs, Shrimp laden noodles and other steamy delights from the little kitchen! Â The service while somewhat slow for a weeknight dinner was very thoughtful an nice. Our waiter even offered to snap a photo of us all between bites. All of the desserts were also phenomenal and exactly as described. They also very happy to annouce - they have esspresso, lattees and cappucinos as well ! Â If you have a sweet spot for chocolate, it is the chocolate torte that can't be missed.. SO much more than a chocolate cake. It can't be described - it must be experienced!

It's a giant open space filled with high wood tables, ornate pillars encircled by dragons, funky wall decor, and an anthropomorphic sheet metal octopus sits behind the bar above bottles of Japanese whiskey.I had the Sea and Smoke cocktail to start: an Asian twist on Pencillin with strong flavours of ginger and citrus (as expected) and also sake and yuzu.The maki we had was delicious, albeit somewhat heavy on mayonnaise. The most notable part of the meal was definitely the wagyu steak, which was succulent and absolutely melted in the mouth. The blackened octopus was not what we expected, as it came in tiny cubes on skewers; dotted with spicy mayo, it was delicious nonetheless.RUKA is no authentic Japanese experience but it knows exactly what it wants to be and it's good at it: a cool place to take a friends or a date and throw back some cocktails, shareable plates, and platter after platter of maki rolls.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1197,3,"The decor in Ruka is really cool, and they have great cocktails, but the food was nothing to write home about. The octopus was probably the best thing we had - I didn't love any of the sushi rolls, and everything else we had just tasted kind of strange.

My family made reservations here on a Saturday night, and we tried a little bit of everything. It's tapas style with smaller portions, so don't be afraid to be generous with ordering more (unless your bank account says otherwise, of course).I only eat plant-based now, and the vegetarian/vegan-friendly foods I tried include the El Gordo sushi roll (sweet potato, avocado, tofu, cukes), the quinoa salad (sans cheese), and plancha broccoli. El Gordo was good, although I wouldn't call it amazingly exceptional with the high caliber of non-traditional sushi these days. The quinoa salad was well dressed, with a generous amount of roasted Brussels sprouts robust enough to complement the vinaigrette. The plancha broccoli, however, was by far my favorite, with slabs of grilled broccoli scattered with paprika(?)/chili-covered peanuts. The linchpin of all the flavors was the curry sauce, with its hint of coconut that wasn't too overwhelming (as opposed to Thai yellow curry). Absolutely delicious.They're only 5pm onwards, so drop by for a first date, eccentric dinner, casual drinks, or late-night sushi.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1200,5,Japanese and Peruvian tapas from sushi to Peruvian street food.Get the wagyu steak it's kind of a korean bbq themed dish (kabob) with butter and wasabi-rocoto salsa pair that with they're newly arrived Peruvian beer.,RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1201,1,"I remember having a good time here the first time I visited Boston, so I decided to come after work for a couple drinks on a Friday night at the bar, now that I live in Boston. I came with a few co-workers and sat at the area near the bar. A waiter came by and everyone ordered a cocktail on the menu. We chatted for 20 min the drink never came. I stood up and found the waiter who took our order to see if he had forgot about us and he simple said the drinks are being worked on. Another 10 min pass I went to front desk asking about those drinks and she said she'll go check on that. Waited another 10 min and went to front desk again to cancel our order. We left and wasted 40 min of my Friday night. What a shame!",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1202,4,"I still enjoy Ruka however I feel they aren't a FIVE star experience anymore. I went the other night, my first drink wasn't what I ordered but that's fine, it was still good, although too sweet for me. My second drink was also very sweet. What was most disappointing is they used to have this great book of cocktails for their drink menu. It was original and had some great options. They've paired it way back to a single ordinary list of cocktails. Nothing really struck my fancy but since we were already there I tried a couple. I will still go back to Ruka with friends because I enjoy the vibe but won't run there excited about getting an original and tasty cocktail.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1203,5,We got lucky finally and snagged a table at the Sushi bar without making a reservation. I love fusion cuisine like this and this place was no exception. Big shoutout to the Wagyu steak and the Lima-style calamari. The Wagyu just melts in your mouth like it should! And the calamari is so unique with its added buttery taste. Will definitely have to come back because there were dishes we weren't able to try this time.,RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1204,5,"Ruka is delicious, it's fun, and it's not cheap - but it's definitely worth it. You walk in and are immediately struck by the space. It's really well decorated and lends to a fun vibe. This would be a good spot for a celebratory night out, so long as you're not looking for something quiet. Our waitress did the thing where we asked for recommendations and she recommended the most expensive thing in each category - we see you. In the end, we ordered on the low side of amount recommended per person and were totally happy. My favorite things we ate: eggplant roll, spicy tuna roll, Japanese fried chicken. The tuna poke wasn't bad, but wasn't particularly memorable either. Speaking of memorable, we got some sort of ice cream sundae with a fish waffle. I'm not seeing the dessert menu online but do not miss this! See the photo. Bruleed banana and everything. Also, cocktails here are great. Highly recommend.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1205,5,"All the top uncooked fish cultures are represented: Japanese, Peruvian, and Hawaiian.

But it was all innovative and creative and amazing so you should definitely go.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1206,3,"I had high hopes for RUKA given all the good reviews on Yelp and from my friends. Maybe that's why I was a tad disappointed with my experience - don't get me wrong - nothing was bad, but I wasn't WOWed! The restaurant is chic and modern and it was packed at 7:30 on a Friday night (reservation recommended!). The menu is tapas style and that range from Maki to fish crudo to pasta and skewers- a real fusion restaurant! My favorite dishes of the night were the Octopus skewers and Wagyu Bavette (also skewers). Both items had the perfect combination of texture and rich flavors. The Scallion Roti with feta dip was also pretty good and had a unique flavor that I've never tasted before.We also tried the Pasta with Chinese Lamb Sausage, Maki with crispy shrimp, and Lamb Belly, which in my opinion were just fine but nothing special. I could probably give a 4 Star to the restaurant judging solely on the food as overall they were pretty tasty. However, the waitress we had was TERRIBLE - not very friendly (no smile whatsoever, and not knowledgeable at all about the menu (when we asked how was the Wagyu Bavette made, all she could tell us was ""they were small pieces of beef"". Duh.. wasn't that obvious and oh, so helpful?!). She was also not there most of the time when we wanted to get another drink or add another dish. Totally not what I expected for service from a restaurant like this. Hope they can better train their staff before putting them to work, especially given the nature of the fusion restaurant that a lot of people will need help to understand a lot of the dishes on the menu.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1207,3,"First time here at RUKA. Really nice decor inside with wood accents around the restaurant. Â I was also thoroughly impressed with the attentiveness of the waitstaff. Â When it comes to the food, I give it the A-OK rating. Â We ordered a wide variety of dishes from the menu and they were definitely small portions. The Spicy tuna had small pebbles on it and each piece was decorated with finesse. Â The roll however tasted pretty ordinary.The dumplings were ok- dressed in a nice spicy sauce. Â If you want real authentic for a better value, you could get it in chinatown down the street.The sashimi plate was average. Â Nothing to write home about. Overall, I loved the ambiance and service.

Ruka is near the Boston Opera House, Emerson Paramount, Boston Common, and Downtown Crossing so you will have plenty to see and do nearby. This was our 2nd visit to the restaurant and they didn't disappoint. We had a reservation for 3 and even though we arrived a little early we were seated right away. We started with cocktails and a mocktail for my little cousin. The menu is comprised of shareable plates sort of like tapas but a little bigger in portion size. We started with the Tuna Poke and two orders of the Blackened Octopus (yes they are that good). The next couple of dishes that came out were the Chao Shou Pork Wontons (sans dairy), the Crispy Lamb Belly Katsu, and the Japanese Fried Chicken. The Japanese Fried Chicken does contain dairy so I decided to eat it along with some Lactaid pills. Any pain I may have had from dairy was beyond worth it! The Japanese Fried Chicken was the best dish of the night (it also happens to be a new addition to the menu). The textures and flavors hit on all notes and leave you completely satisfied. Our final savory dish was the Chicken Fried Rice which was also very good.Apparently we weren't full enough and we decided to be gluttons. We ended up ordering 3 desserts. I brought the Lactaid pills with me especially for dessert. The fried dough bites (I can't remember the exact name) are amazing. They are warm, soft, and the perfect amount of sweet. The other two desserts were a big hit although I didn't try them so I can't speak to specifics.The one issue I have with Ruka Restobar is really just a personal preference. I am a fast eater normally so I wish the dishes would come to the table a little slower and give us more time to relax. Everyone who visits will not be disappointed with the drinks, food, and service at Ruka.",RUKA Restobar,"505 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1211,4,It was a perfect combination of small plates and sushi.

Came here mainly for the bar and a quick bite. Got a rock crab roll per bartender's recommendation. Literally it's just a roll with avocado and cucumber inside and a small fried shrimp on top. $20 for that? Looool. The chicken fried rice was amazing. Over priced? Of course. I've read so many good reviews about this place but was really disappointed with the food. Maybe the actual entrees here are better. I don't see myself coming back here for food anytime soon.

We were seated right on time but the service was a little slow and we didn't see our waiter for quite a while, for which he apologized. I wasn't impressed with the cocktail selection - I had the Pisco punch and it was too bitter. Some of the food was average at best including the pork wontons and chocolate cheesecake, but others were SO delicious. We loved the blackened octopus, wagyu steak, and fried dough dessert.

It wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it was good for the price. I ordered the pozole and it was fantastic! It came with all the bells and whistles. My family got the burritos and they equally enjoyed the flavor. The only downside to this place is that there was very little seating. We got lucky and it wasn't too crowded but if you do want to try this place I'd definitely do take out. All in all, I was surprised to find good Mexican food in Boston. This place surprised me.

One of our favorite parts about this place.The pozole is to die for--fresh and full of many flavors--but only available on weekends. Â We tend to get a taco combination platter with beef tongue (lengua) and carnitas, and then try a few other things. The tortillas have a very nice corn flavor and dense texture. We also recently really enjoyed the Jalisco's quesadilla. Value is pretty good.Honestly, though, some dishes can be hit or miss. Sometimes the carnitas are deliciously tender but sometimes dry, res is somewhat underflavored, some things don't taste as ""just made"" as is possible (maybe better when there's more turnover instead of a weeknight?).But it's not enough to really weigh down the really good elements.

If I do an airport run anytime around lunch or dinner at Boston Logan this automatically becomes a priority. There is plenty of free parking all around and it's about 3 minutes from all terminals. Let's talk about the food! Their chimichanga is bar none the best I have ever tried! I'm not sure what they're wrapping those fresh ingredients in, but it is flaky, light and delectable!! Any meat I have ever enjoyed here has been so tender it is unbelievable! They bring the term 'melt in your mouth' to the next level. Lastly, their flan is homemade in-house.

All I'm saying is, I crave Mexican food often and in large quantities. I originally came to Taqueria Jalisco on a recommendation and have been back one other time since. The food is delicious, affordable, and authentic. I've gotten both the carnitas and the birria, and boy, did they satisfy my cravings. I even had leftovers from my carnitas plate! For what it's worth, I wholeheartedly recommend Taqueria Jalisco!",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"1226,5,"Eating 4.7 or 4.8Price: tacos were 2.50 each which was a great deal and had plenty of protein. Pozole soup was 9.50 if I recall correctly. I got a small but it was a big bowl. I was full after my meal and would gladly pay the price again for the food. Good deal and great taste.Tacos: Lengua- I bought 4 tacos. 2 lengua (beef tongue) and 2 carne asada. The lengua was really good. Beef tongue may sound gross to you but if you like pot roast then you'll like this. I topped mine off with the green salsa and the chipotle salsa. Both were excellent. The salsas has body and wasn't watered down with water to increase volumes I appreciated that. Â The tart and the slight heat made the tacos even better. Even on its own with just like squeezed on it was still one of the best lengua tacos I've ever had.Carne Asada- the carne Asada I had here was okay in my book. I think I'm used to a different kind. This carne Asada was kinda chopped up and wasn't ""juicy"" or didn't have much ""chew"" to it. Like it wasn't as steak like as other ones I've had in the past. Also there was no char on these. Pozole/soup: Â I've never had pozole before but I've seen it on tv. It was between this and the menudo. I'm not big into organ meats so I opted out of menudo. Pozole was light and it came out with a plate of cabbage, raw onions, oregano, and crisp tortilla discs (didn't taste like a corn tortilla). Â You season according to your preference.The broth itself was light and refreshing, sour and herbal with the oregano and lime. I like the soup and can see how it's comforting on a cold day. The soup itself contained cubes of pork and to my surprise a piece of pork leg. Â Chips: there were tortilla chips that came with before the food with homemade salsa. The chips were a five in my opinion and I usually homemade. Â The masa used to make these chips tasted different, not like the typical ones you get at Tex mex restaurants. Â Hard to describe unless you go there and try for yourself. Tomato Salsa has less heat but had a sweet taste to it. I liked it.Service: great service and the cashier/owner was very nice and friendly.Definitely will be coming back if and when I'm in Boston again.If you like tacos and Mexican food come here.

I've been to Mexico twice and plan to go back many more times, in large part because of the food there. This place took me there on a cold December night. There are five tables and four counter seats. The servers were so friendly and attentive. Mexican music in the background and wonderfully authentic decor. It felt like the time I stayed in Playa del Carmen by myself and strolled into local food joints I picked on some appetizers. The Sope is so yummy. I've never had one, but it's a thick, masa tortilla that is fried until crispy and puffy. I had mine topped with chicken tinga (pulled with chipotle and onions etc. GET ON IT if you don't know tinga), lettuce, cheese, and perhaps a white sauce. Delicious with wonderful textures. Then came the tostada de camaron - oh. man. (Ay cabrÃ_n!). Perfection. It was like a shrimp ceviche on a crispy tortilla. It had a sweetness to it with wonderful textures and freshness. Lastly, the Jalisco quesadilla, more like an empanada topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese and sauce. Clearly everything here is VERY fresh and made with authentic, Mexican love. Don't miss this place.",Taqueria Jalisco,"291 Bennington St Boston, MA 02128"1230,4,"Mexican comfort food. If you are craving authentic and simple food then look no further than East Boston. I recommend that you come on the weekends, so that you can order one of their special weekend soups. The pork pozole was comfort in a bowl. I also enjoyed their birria and lengua tacos. The lengua in particular had a great flavor. The chicken tamal wasn't bad. The mole enchiladas were very satisfying. Service was extremely friendly. Worth the trip out East.

Call me a purist, but I love that the tacos are so simple and served with onions and cilantro, and they don't load them up with other crap that doesn't belong in a taco. The service is great, and the ladies that work there are super nice and attentive. I'm only docking a star because the salsa could be better. It's not bad, just not the best I've ever had.

Stella was a great find and easy to walk to, weather permitting. We were nicely greeted and quickly seated. After perusing the pics online, we decided to get the Parmesan Arancini for an app and the tagliatelle bolognese. We also sampled a libation named Nefertiti, made with peach purÃ©e, vodka, Â tumeric, lemon and simple syrup, very delicious. Both dishes were great, we love Italian food in Boston.

Â Both the dinner menu and the Happy Hour menu were handed to me for my perusal. Â I felt a bit piggish when I selected 3 of the items off the $6 menu, but I somehow managed to consume it all! Â (Although admittedly two of the dishes were rather on the light side.)Parmesan Tater Tots / Spicy Truffle Aioli (not found on the regular menu)Light crisp shell with tender potato shreds within. Â These were quite enjoyable, but so small, it was hard to justify them being a dollar each.Beef Carpaccio / Pickled Shallots / Lemon Aioli / Parmesan / Baby Croutons (reg $13)Yummy carpaccio! Â So thin though, this was a very light dish. Â With the scattering of baby croutons, crostini were deemed an unnecessary component by the kitchen, I guess. Â But I prefer my slices of raw meat on toast, which they kindly provided upon inquiry.Parmesan Arancini / Buffalo Mozzarella / Spicy Pomodoro Fondue (reg $13)About the size of ping pong balls, I felt the rice balls to be rather mushy.

They're universally loathed by chefs everywhere. They are the very picture of entitled, negative energy. They're bad for chefs, they're bad for restaurants.

We split the salmon special of the day and the homemade gnocchi--INCREDIBLE. The sauce on the gnocchi was very unique and soo good. Great service too.

I like the neighborhood, I like the bar, the menu has not changed at all in years and is just so so. It's busy and popular with the after work crowd. I like it for drinks and apps, that's about it. Service is average and a bit underwhelming. Take it or leave it.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1252,4,Classic New England Restaurant/Bar with a fantastic location. Very chill atmosphere with a good wait staff. I ate here on a Tuesday night so the dining room wasn't too busy --- so service was extremely fast.The menu was very creative --- both food as well as the cocktail menu.

Would come here again definitely.",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1254,1,"One of the worst quality Italian restaurants I've ever been to. Extremely below par. Butter used in such excess it congealed on my plate. No flavor, no taste. Our wine came with debris floating in it. 100$ bill for some of the worst quality food I've ever had. Very unfortunate considering such good reviews. Decor is cheap and I should have known the food would be the same...",Stella,"1525 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1255,5,"Best Hot Pot in Boston!Honestly, there are two key elements to a good hot pot meal : the meat and the broth. Veggies? Not much in my game. The meat quality at Q is much better than any other hot pot places around (and i've been to many). I've tried most of their meats and each has tremendous marble and thats what I look for when it comes to good quality beef. The meat alone secures a great hot pot experience. Then it comes the broth. Unlike other hot pot places where most of the broth choices are just either bland or merely salty, each of Q's broths is prepared with great flavor. And you can taste the ingredients and work they put in the broth. All broths are good here but I love the tomato broth and crazy mala broth most. I normally order half and half. You get the deep tomato flavor with strong aroma from other chinese spices from the tomato broth, and you also get the exciting, spicy, numbing flavor from the crazy mala broth. Nothing tops that.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1256,3,"We came here based on the positive reviews, and while the service was amazing, the food was not. The appetizers (fried veggie rolls and shrimp balls) were delicious. For our meals we got a sushi roll (can't remember the name) and my husband ordered the general gau's chicken. About halfway into eating his meal, we noticed a piece a hair wrapped around it. I was sitting across from him and despite me being so far away from his food, I thought it had to be my own hair somehow and just ignored it. But no, it was someone from the kitchen. The second time hair appeared in his food again, I took a picture. Gross. I took a look around and no one was wearing hair nets, not even the guys cooking sushi at the bar in the dining room. Won't be back.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1257,3,"Came here because of all the reviews on yelp. I wish I could try the hot pot but we were too full to start with and wouldn't have been able to finish it and we wanted to try different dishes. The place is quite huge and you automatically feel at zen as you enter. We were quickly seated, as it was quite late, they were quite empty any way. We started off with the scallion pancake. Honestly I didn't like it as much. It was extremely oily and not quite flavorful. We got the sushi/sashami combo which comes with side of miso soup. The soup was extremely delicious which tells me they have amazing broths and their hot pots would have been a good idea. The sushi's are undoubtedly good! You won't be able to stop eating once you start.! Their cocktails were okay. Nothing too exciting. We tried quite a few different ones -dragon lotus, shanghai mule, ginger q tini and manhattan love story. Our server , was definitely friendly and knowledgeable but seemed a bit impatient. I did like the ambience and the food. Quite possible the little issues we had was because it was quite late in the night and they were ready to close. I would still recommend the place. Their menu is enormous and quite a few options to chose from.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1258,5,"Still in love with this place. Everything still stands. I come twice a year for Dine Out Boston for the amazing deal and then some because the food and service is actually pretty good.Surprisingly though, it's a poppin' happy hour spot on Thursdays so ... be prepared to wait. Also, when they're busy, they won't seat you without your full party.Also, the Crazy Mala Broth is no joke people. It's REALLY tasty but even this was pushing my spice limits - the amount of chilis are not just for show.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1259,4,"Came here for dinner before attending a show at a nearby theater. Wait was about half an hour at 6pm on a Saturday. Once seated service was prompt and friendly. Their menu is divided into hot pot, sushi and Chinese dishes. While hot pots are the main attraction we ordered the chicken and broccoli and beef chow fun from the Chinese menu. Both items were good and prices at this restaurant were fair so I would come back if in the area but avoid if short on time due to the high wait time.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1260,5,"This was amazing. It's been a couple of months so I can't remember exactly what we had but here goes. The hotspot! Wow! We got the veggie one with vegan broth (a couple of the broths are vegan). This is a massive amount of food for 2 people. I think it can easily feed 3-4 hungry people. We got the veggie fried rice on the waiters rec and it was as good as he said it would be. Also a massive portion. It was my 2 year olds birthday, so the manager himself brought her a complimentary chocolate cake with candles and they all sang to her, she loved it!!! Great service, exceedingly knowledgeable staff, modern space, great atmosphere and delicious food. I really don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. Mouth watering while I'm typing. Next time I'm in Boston, I'll come back!Please have some Asian music on next time",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1261,4,"Since our previous designation did not pan out for us, we crossed the street in Boston's happening Chinatown & came to Q's. While we waited for our casual meal of appetizers, we were educated on the world of Hot Pot. I simply 'feed' off being culturally educated while partaking in good Asian food. Our table had its own personal induction cook top, which was a 1st for me to see. Â & for the other newbies, it looks like an eye from an electric stove, single burner, cooktop or the back in the day hot plate. HotPot 101;* Server turns on the cook top & lets it heat up. * Your table is covered with raw Vegetables, Meats, Seasonings, Spices, Noodles, Rice, & your preferred Sauces. * Server brings out the Hot Pot, which has two sections for different broths of your choosing. * Let the Hot Pot creation & cooking begin.What a fun & interactive DIY concept. Â We saw some guests using their ladles to drink the broth & to note, there are pre-made Hot Pot selections like the Supreme Seafood. Q's interior was very welcoming with the colorful dÃ©cor, & has a Sushi Bar that also offers individual cook tops. Thank you to our generous & friendly Server David, for not only taking good care of us yet sharing enlightening Hot Pot insight along the way.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1262,5,"This is no doubt the gem of Chinatown. I'm always hesitant to go because of the long wait but every time I go I am reminded again of why they have a long wait. Their hot pot broths are so flavorful I don't even use the dipping sauces. The wagyu rib eye was so juicy and perfectly fatty it melted right in my mouth. The rest of the hot pot food were all fresh and had a pretty sizable portion. Their Chinese cuisine appetizers are surprisingly good too for a hot pot specialty restaurant. Our waiter was super helpful and patient with our big party and attentive despite how busy they were. Definitely coming back again, maybe earlier on a week day so I don't have to wait as long.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1263,4,"The aesthetic and service of this restaurant gets an A+ but the food was just meh. I've been to several shabu shabu places and the food here was just okay. Personally, I think if you do hot pot you should go somewhere that is AYCE. We ordered the lunch special. I think this is the way to go because then you're not overpaying for your meal. The bases that we got were flavorful but I wasn't too keen on the taste. We got the Mala and the standard base. You have to pay extra for anything other than the standard base... minus half a star. Then, the soup contents came in. You get a bowl of veggies and your choice of meat. I got the shrimp, nothing spectacular. I did like the inclusion of enoki mushrooms, but you got one broccoli and one tofu piece LAME... minus another half star.Overall, fair place with flavorful soups and decent food. The atmosphere was great, and I do commend the customer service. The manager (I think) personally came over and got our feedback on the meal and service. TL;DR:- Recommend: yes- Service: great- Tips: come for the lunch special",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1264,4,"This is undoubtedly a happening and trendy spot in the heart of Boston's Chinatown. Ambience is very pleasant and the menu boasts an incredible depth of fusion ranging from hot pot to spicy Sichuan cuisine. My wife and I enjoyed an order of the Mala Spicy Fish that was sautÃ©ed in a tangy sauce with some red chili peppers. The overall flavor was solid but the signature Sichuan spice level went amiss, perhaps due to a lack of Sichuan peppercorns. They charged extra for accompanying steamed rice despite the dish already being a pricey $15. Pricing still wasn't bad all things considered; tasty seafood doesn't come cheap at fancy spots and that's totally understandable. The real blemish was the service lagging visibly due to large crowds on a lively Saturday night and our waitress entirely forgot to bring out an order of General Tso Tofu, which ultimately worked in our favor because our fish entree filled us up well. On the whole, this is a spot worth checking out as long as you're okay with long waiting times, particularly on the weekends.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1265,4,"Getting to the end of the part of the engagement where I'll be in the Chinatown district at lunch time, I'm trying to make the most of the great Oriental food here. Q Restaurant is one of the fancier places here.It looks like the ""go to"" here is the hot pot as each of the tables has a burner and most of the tables had a steaming bowl of soup going. It looked complicated and I probably need a guide before I dive into that. Instead, I chose the sesame chicken. A decent portion of battered and fried chicken bits in a tasty sauce with a dusting of sesame seeds on top. With a few pieces of broccoli and a scoop of rice, a good meal.My dining mate had sushi and said that it was good. I nabbed one piece of the spicy salmon roll. Tasty!I'd really like to return to Q but I need someone to help me with the hot pot thing.",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1266,5,This place was great!When we came the place looked busy but we were told that the wait was only 10 minutes. They have a bar where you can sit and order drinks while you wait. We were seated quickly.Our server helped explain the hot pots on the menu and what people usually order together. When the hot pot arrived he explained to us how long the food cooks for and suggested that we dip the meat in their special soy sauce which made it taste amazing!

Don't ask me how I did it or why I did it ( because I love food.), but out of all the places I went this place was hands down absolutely amazing. If I lived in Boston I would probably live in this place. I'd be ordering a hot tub full of hot pot broth so that I could have a half a lifetime supply of the devilishly beautifully spiced broth. Â I'm actually salivating while I'm writing this post. I ordered the Spicy Mala hot pot, and it was absolutely out of this world. Don't be one of those people and get the damn crab ragoons.

I took my friend her for her first time having hot pot and Q Restaurant did NOT disappoint! Our server Phanna was wonderful! He was attentive and friendly.

Definitely would come back here for lunch sometime!",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1270,3,"First time going to this restaurant for a birthday celebration last night and wasn't impressed. The place comes off as a high end hot pot vibe place although tiny in size. The wait was a little ridiculous for what it was worth. I placed down my name and waited about an hour before being seated. Although my whole party wasn't there yet, she told me once everyone got there she would be able to seat us right away. Once 3/4 of my party got there, one of my friends had asked if we could be seated since a majority of us were there but the front receptionist said they didn't have a table for us but then proceeded to seat the couple that had walked in 15 mins prior although I waited an hour. The booth the couple were seated at could have definitely fit me and my 3 friends. I got the surf and turf and honestly the quality was comparable to shabu shabu or shabu zen nothing special, but to have waited in line that long for quality just as comparable to shabu shabu was not worth the wait. Not to mention they messed up on our broth requests, we requested for mala and kimchi broth but definitely just got the House broth and kimchi. Summary:Honestly I don't see the hype, I definitely wouldn't go on a weekend. The price was on par for the surf and turf at $21 like shabu shabu/shabu zen, I think I'd stick to those places since it's easier parking and quicker seating with same quality. Pros:Our server was friendly and professional Complementary birthday cake slice Cons:Difficulty finding parking since it's Chinatown Rude receptionist Quality was not as great as I thought I'd beLong waits",Q Restaurant,"660 Washington St Boston, MA 02111"1271,5,"Come for hot pot not sushi - and come for lunch! Â Their lunch special is generous for your tummy and the bank and it's less crowded. Â In my opinion, they have the best dipping sauce(s) for hot pot in the city.

Q Restaurant gets LIT. Upon entering, Q is like any other upscale Asian restaurant. Complete with chandelier, waterfall, mood lights, and full bar. But, what makes them different is how they play full-blown top charts hip hop. It's kind of odd at first, but quickly sets the tone for a fun time. I'm such a fan.Their hot pot selection is pretty good. I love how you can do half/half broth flavors for no additional cost. I highly recommend trying their popular Mala broth. It's a bit spicy, but dangerously good. Their Surf N Turf plate was amazing and it includes slices of very tender lamb. Yum, my mouth is watering just thinking about it now.My boyfriend and I also shared their Sushi Deluxe. The sushi was so vibrant and buttery.

The other night we met up there with my brother and hisgirlfriend, both professors in their 30's with a prestigious university system out west. After the valet, I met them inside and we took to our table, a nice seating area of about 5 tables in the back near the kitchen. My party was of five, and appetizers were ordered. A bottle of beautiful red Pio Cesere was ordered and decanted to the tune of $250. We all ate, happily caught up, and enjoyed the ambiance and the company. A patron from another table who happened to look bout 80 years old came over to address us for being ""too loud""'. We acknowledged her concern and she went away. I immediately addressed it with the manager. Under no circumstances at any eating establishment do I expect to be addressed in this fashion by another patron. Especially when hosting an intimate party of 5. The manager seemed genuine and said he would address it. It is still unclear to me if he did.

Made the reservation through Opentable. Made several changes and they were pleasant each time, even when we showed up sans one guest. Â Place was packed. I ordered a cocktail.The place was loud but the lighting was gorgeous and flattering. I started with a half order of a Caprese salad which had burrata. The burrata was amazing! I'd get this again and I think the half order was enough- two thick slices of tomato, a small ball of burrata, fresh basil and a light dressing of EVOO. I then had a half order of the asparagus special. Three spears was an appropriate amount for me. Another great choice! The asparagus were perfectly cooked, they also gave me a poached egg hiding under the hard cheese slices. Wow and yummy!!!!! For my main I got a half order of the rigatoni. Cooked perfectly a dente! But it was a heavy dish. I finished with the white chocolate blueberry tart per the waiter's suggestion. Good call. The blueberries were big and sweet and ripe.

The ambience was nice and reminded me of being in Italy. Our party had reservations on a weeknight (Monday) for 8PM. The place was packed and very loud. I'm glad we made reservations earlier in the day. The service started out slow. I felt like I was waiting for a while before our order was placed. When we finally ordered, the waiter was attentive to our needs and provided fresh baked bread. My brother ordered a beer and got the wrong one. The server was nice and replaced it for the right one. We ordered the cheese platter with truffle honey. The truffle honey was absolutely delicious! It was poured all over the cheese, the fresh pears, Â and apples. I ordered the gnocchi. It was one of the best handmade gnocchi dishes I've had. It was made with fresh tomato sauce, melted mozzarella cheese and basil. My husband ordered the T-Bone steak. According to my hubby, it was cooked as ordered and had a nice flavor, juicy and tender. My brother ordered the rigatoni with bolognese blanco.

Also tried: Minestrone soup, Sausage Rigatoni, and TiramisuPros:- The portions are quite large, despite this being a restaurant week item, this place did not skimp out on their portions. - The lemon tart was my favourite because it didn't feel very heavy even after I ate all the appetizer and steak. The citrus was light and refreshing. - The steak wasn't the best I've tried but it was solid, the potatoes were not dry and it was nice having some of the brandy sauce to dip it in. - Location: very nice restaurant ambience in the most beautiful part of Boston ( Beacon Hill) near the Boston common. Cons:- The steak had a bit too much sauce that I was just tasting sauce and less steak.

For our entrees, we each got a pasta dish. I went with the linguine pesto. Ever since that dish, I've been craving pesto. Their pesto is A+. Strong basil taste, hint of garlic and parmesan, and made with good quality olive oil. When I went back a second time (because I desperately wanted the pesto pasta again), 3 out of 4 of us got pasta dishes and the last person got pollo Toscano. We all cleaned our plates.

Our first choice that night had a long wait so we came across the street and gave Toscano a try. I'm glad our first option wasn't available because this was the best meal of the trip.Tables were all reserved, but the bar was available so we sat at the bar where the full menu was available. The bartender took good care of us and we had an enjoyable evening.We started with the Caprese which was delicious. The Burrata was creamy and delicious. The tomatoes and basil were fresh. We also ordered Bruschetta which featured the same ingredients and was delicious with a nice crispy bread.My main entrÃ©e was the Ortolano Risotto. The risotto and vegetables were perfectly prepared. The dish had a great flavor and the perfect amount of seasoning. I enjoyed this dish very much. Of course as usual my husband picked the stand out entrÃ©e. That was the Pappardelle Bolognese Bianco. My husband and I agreed that this was probably the best Bolognese that either of us has had before. It was meaty and delicious. The pasta was nicely prepared as well.For dessert we shared a White Chocolate Blueberry Tart. The tart was buttery and flaky.

I got the lobster trio and my friend got the lobster roll. The crab and lobster rolls were the best! Shrimp was ok.What I love about the way they do their rolls here is that the bread is toasted and buttery, and their seafood is NOT dunked in mayo. I found that a lot of lobster rolls around Boston had a ton of mayo on them and it just tasted like mayo. Yuck. These were fresh tasting, with the seasoning just right, and the perfect size for sampling all 3 flavors.They forgot about my friend's order so hers took a while to come, but they offered her a free drink to apologize.

However, I was able to find a seat and ate my food without having to stand. YEAH!The menu is simple and not extensive, which is good and Â had your basic lobster, crab, and shrimp rolls and the few usual suspects of clam chowder and lobster chowder. I ordered the most basic things, the lobster and crab roll with as small clam chowder.The verdict; the lobster and crab rolls tasted good because they were subtly dressed and was kept as pure as possible on its perfectly toasted rolls. The clam chowder was salty for my taste and was more on the watery side. Overall, I wasn't floored and wasn't terribly disappointed. My only rant is it was $40 for those three items and I felt it was expensive. Would I come back, maybe.

We found parking to be a bit of challenge and expensive, similar to LA. Most of parking garages were charging $20, but we were fortunate to find one for $10 and only a few blocks away. Place is really small with probably enough room for about 10-15 people. Most usually order to go.We ordered the lobster roll and small cup of clam chowder. The rolls were served on a buttered, toasted roll, with lemon butter, very little mayo, and seasoning. Aside from the fact these rolls was small and expensive ($18), they put decent amount of lobster. No fillers, just good size chunks of lobster. Getting your seafood locally sourced definitely makes a difference. The flavor and freshness was fantastic. I like that they only put a little mayo, so less calories and doesn't mask flavor of lobster. Surprising, the clam chowder ($6) was good too. Just as good as the first time.

This shop has interior dining options and no outside dining option. They have barstool seating and some small 2-4 person tables inside. The food was served fast. I loved how crispy the roll was and how fresh the seafood tasted. The lobster had a bit of bay seasoning on top (advertised as their secret seasoning but tasted bay seasoning-like).

Â  I know my wines, I know prices, and these were exorbitant. Â  When you drop a car payment on wine you expect quality, and the value simply wasn't here. Â  If they unilaterally lowered their alcohol prices to more consistent and reasonable levels they would be 5 stars.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1337,3,"First off, I want to sing the praises of the staff, here. Our waiter and all support staff were amazing and attentive, there were longer gaps in service as we were almost done but our server had a large group and was still acceptably attentive. The food was good but price to portion ratio was off, Imo. I could have easily eaten another entree, I'm not a large person. The cheese appetizer was small. The portions were just small all around. My Disarrono Sour was exceptional, it was fresh and tangy, best I've ever had! I had the Rabbit entree and my husband had the Beef entree. Both were great, just small. I ordered 2 desserts after they brought us one on the House (it was our anniversary) and the peach tart is TO DIE FOR! Freshly baked to order. Now, my reason for 3 stars, we asked for the most private table possible, which I think is impossible at this restaurant because it is so ridiculously cramped. The other tables were so close I proximity to us, there is legitimately no privacy, at all. The servers make do with Space but it is really cramped. We had to push our table back so my husband wasn't getting bumped by the staff. The decor was cute and it felt kind of like eating at my nonni's, just too cramped. All in all, it was a nice restaurant but we probably won't return because we left hungry after spending 190$.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1338,5,"What a gem! Â The atmosphere is amazing. They had me at pesto... Â From being seated and paying for our meal, it was a pleasure eating here. We sat upstairs overlooking the street. Lovely restaurant and delicious food. I even overheard the waiter accommodating some young children making sure they could serve them something they would enjoy. Glad we came.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1339,5,"Busy restaurant, even during weekdays, definitely make a reservation before you go. Â At least there is a nice seating area for waiting customer. The waiting staff is friendly and attentive.The food lives up to the hype. The menu changes every day but they have a few that says everyday such as boglonese. I ordered the boglognese past and lobster pasta. The boglognese was good but the lobster pasta was divine. It has delicious mushroom and fish roe on top, which adds so much texture to the pasta. All the pasta are fresh and has wonderful texture.The place is a little cramped but so are many North End restaurants. Street parking is hard as always. But the food is worth it.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1340,4,"We came here for Valentine's Day dinner and this place as so cute. We had a table upstairs by the windows overlooking the square... and so quaint! The menu for that day was the prix fixe menu, and that was fine because it was still a large selection and it included all of their popular items. I got a lobster pasta as an app, the osso busco as the entree and the tiramisu as dessert. The lobster pasta was good... the lobster was fresh and it was a lot of lobster for an app. I've never had osso busco before and for my first experience it was pretty good. The veal was super tender and the risotto was nicely flavored as well. The tiramisu was alright, it was good for sure, but it was not the best I've had.All in all, I would come back here again just for the setting. Plus you can't Â go wrong with the food!",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1341,1,You have to be prepared to eat on their terms. Me I was way different than what they advertised. Ridiculously over priced!!,Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1342,5,"Crazy good food and service.We had Rafael as a waiter and Tom at the Bar and they were super. The restaurant itself was more upscale than I thought it would be - after a day of touring we weren't exactly dressed for the occasion but they still were very nice to us.The menu changes daily I guess with fresh ingredients and different in season stuff.I really enjoyed the Ossobuco - tender and well seasoned. We liked the cheese and salami appetizers and wine list was fantastic with great Italian wines. Wish we had dressed a little nicer, but we had a fantastic evening and loved the quaint location and restaurant.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1343,5,"Wow wow wow! One of the top ten meals I've had. Located in quiet North Square, just a block away from bustling Hanover Street, Mamma Maria's is just where you want to be on a cold winter day in Boston. Super cozy when you get inside. We were seated upstairs overlooking North Square. From the service to the food, everything was impeccable. Do yourself a a favor and get off Hanover Street and come here.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1344,4,"Amazing service. My husband got some pasta sauce on his white shirt and someone saw and brought him club soda and a fresh napkin to clean it off right away without us asking. Food was pretty good, great location.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1345,2,"Go ahead and pass on this place. Nothing special, service was mediocre to match the food. My husband and I came a little after 5pm, we didn't have reservations so we came early assuming they'd have tables. They said they'd fit us in, then led us through an empty restaurant and sat us at the small bar where the bartender served us.We were excited to try the uni pasta...but they were out. We had the veal carpaccio, and lobster ravioli instead. After we ordered we sat and listened as the bartender and a server loudly discussed how much they did not want to be there working and serving that day. Hmm...lovely. Veal carpaccio, we may as well have eaten paper. It was that bland and boring. Lobster ravioli was over cooked and needed more sauce. Waste of a meal.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1346,5,"Oh Mamma Maria how I love thee!Last Friday evening I had the joy of celebrating my birthday at Mamma Maria's with my parents and girlfriends from high school. Nestled in a square away from the hustle and bustle of Hanover Street, Mama Marias is perhaps one of the most charming restaurants I've ever visited. Upon entering the establishment, we were greeted by a host who told us that we had the best table in the restaurant... he wasn't kidding. We were led to a tiny room upstairs with a single table inside that overlooked Paul Revere's house. Since my dad has trouble hearing this was absolutely the perfect atmosphere conducive to great conversation. To start we ordered a round of Harvest Salads for the table which came with baby red spinach mix, sliced pear, toasted almonds, fresh tarragon and goat cheese. We also enjoyed a basket of complimentary bread that came with some house made pesto and olives that totally hit the spot.To eat, we ordered a variety of dishes including the Halibut (absolutely DELICIOUS and not to be missed!), the Chicken, Osso Buco (tremendous) and the Frutti di Mare Pasta. We all raved about our dishes and found the portion sizes to be absolutely perfect. To end the night we enjoyed a complimentary Tiramisu with a birthday candle. All in all, Mamma Maria proved itself the perfect place to celebrate my special occasion and is a restaurant that I look forward to visiting for years to come!",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1347,4,"So I finally dined here. 'Twas a Sunday night in the North End and my friends wanted to have a hearty family Italian dinner. Everything was packed but Mama Maria was able to make it happen (thank you to the male host and NOT the female one who is always so rude.)Our server was funny and down to earth. We placed our orders (cheese appetizer, osso bucco, rabbit, pork, and lobster pasta) and waited for our food to arrive.All the food had great flavor but the standout was the lobster pasta. Trust me, get it! The rabbit was a runner up.Overall a great dinner. Not much different than other places in the North End in regard to flavor, but if you're looking for something fancy I can recommend Mamma Maria's. When they're not being temperamental of course!",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1348,3,"The restaurant is beautiful, and well decorated. I had a reservation and still had to wait 10 minutes. Our server seemed as though he was rushing and was impatient, but it was a Sunday evening after all. I ordered the skirt steak, and it was good. Others in my party ordered the rabbit pasta dish and the lobster ravioli dish (completely forgot the names!) and they didn't seem pleased. This place was very expensive for mediocre food and service. Won't be coming back.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1349,5,"So I have been going to the North End for 30+ years and each time we go we try and visit another restaurant to change it up. We are the type that does not make reservations and just goes with it. Â I had always heard wonderful things about Mamma Maria so I made reservations. Â We we seated upstairs near the windows and it was just beautiful. Â The atmosphere was amazing, the drinks ( Manhattan) were perfect and dont even get me started on the food! Â  I had the osso bucco and the portion was so large I did not think I would ever be able to finish it. Â Well after taking my first bite I can assure you I ate it all....and dessert! Â Amazing experience from start to finish. Â The waitstaff was outstanding.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1350,5,"One of our fav places in North End. Food, services and vibes are all incredible. Maybe because the building is like a big house, whenever we come here, we feel like we are invited to a big Italian family dinner.We normally don't do restaurant week menu but this place actually makes efforts to make its restaurant week menu fun. Two years in a row, we did restaurant week course menu, which we enjoyed so much. Their food is always flavorful and creative but not too adventurous, which I like. Their pasta dishes are amazing.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1351,5,"Outstanding from start to finish! The host was very accommodating when our reservation was inadvertently made on the wrong day (my bad), and we arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday night. Fabulous food, outstanding service! We had the lobster ravioli, long bone veal chop (cooked to perfection), and my favorite cacio e pepe (that was offered to me as an entree portion. That's how much I love it). Oh, don't miss the peach cobbler and tiramisu! The service was impeccable. We will absolutely be back.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1352,3,"I guess I just don't understand restaurants in the North End that don't have a plethora of pasta listed on their menu. Why are you even located in the North End then? I had an okay experience at Mamma Maria. Yes, it was very fancy. Yes, the service was wonderful and extremely accommodating. We were even given a semi private room for our group to dine in, which was kind of cool. My issue lies with the menu. The prices were very high for what was in my eyes OK food. The food was decent, don't get me wrong. But, it wasn't great-especially not for the kind of prices we were paying. I did like that they offered half bottles of wine though. That was a nice touch. Vegetarians beware that there are not a lot of meal options for you here. I ordered the Mushroom Tortellini, which was yummy but very, very heavy on the butter. In fact, butter was oozing off my tortellini. I won't be back. I just feel like there are so many other delicious restaurant options in the North End where you can get a better bang for your buck.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1353,5,"I have heard about Mama's for years. Begged my hubby to go for quite some time. Well my hubby surprised me for our anniversary to go to Mama's. I can most definitely say it has become a near and dear favorite for special date night. It has lived up to it's five star reputation. Our service was 5 star, the meals were complements to the chef excellent. I had the Ossobucco, my hubby had the lobster ravioli. Both were mouth watering excellent. I had snagged my hubby's last bite of ravioli it was a very good combination to my Ossobucco. I had Moscato wine which also was very good wine. I'm a picky sweet wine lover. I was impressed. The desserts was Tiramisu and panna cotta with berry glaze. We were so stuffed from dinner that we made room for dessert!Thank you so much for making a memorable night for my hubby and I. Grazie Mille!!! Mrs. Zurhellen",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1354,4,"For me, the best part of Mamma Maria is the space. Right by the Paul Revere House, Mamma Maria was once a beautiful old home and you'll eat dinner in a smaller room as opposed to a massive dining room. I've eaten both on the second floor and downstairs, and both were great experiences.However, the food is pretty darn good too. It's not a cheap evening, but it's worth a spend to have a romantic evening in a well-refurbished restaurant deep in the North End, off the main drag.",Mamma Maria,"3 N Square Boston, MA 02113"1355,5,"I visit boston once a year for PAX EAST. All you gamers out there know what that's about :) Anyway, I get blessed with this annual trip and the opportunity to try different lobster rolls.

Showing some love and recommending their lobster roll because no one else does it better.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1356,4,"Came by on a rainy day and there was still a line. I got the lobster roll which was $19.99. It was pretty good because they give you a good amount of lobster in the roll, but for some reason the whole thing was lacking some kind of flavor. So in short, PRO: lots of meat and pretty short wait in line. CON: lacks flavor",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1357,5,"Amazing lobster roll ($19.99) and double stuffed clam ($8)! I stood in line on a Monday during lunchtime and waited for about 10 minutes, but it's so worth it. I enjoyed my food outside at one of their patio tables. FYI - they have a regular and large lobster roll; I stuck with the regular and was still stuffed - Huge, fresh pieces of lobster. Also, the double stuffed clam was about the size of the palm of my hand and was packed with chunks of clam and stuffing. Large portion sizes with great, fresh flavor for a reasonable price.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1358,4,"WHAT TO TRY?! The lobster rolls. The seafood. The crab cakes. This place is also another place known for their lobster rolls. The moment you enter the shop, you'll see aquariums with lobsters, big and small, and displays of fresh fish, clams, mussels and shrimp. It's like a small fish shop that serves a lot of seafood!!I didn't see the option for hot lobster rolls so they only have the cold option. The pieces of lobster meat on the roll are hugeee. Even though they only offer the lobster roll in cold option, I thought I enjoyed the roll. Too bad this place doesn't come with a complimentary side of fries or coleslaw though. Each order just comes with a just roll, however they have the option of a regular size or large size of the lobster roll. The rolls would be served on different breads and of course more lobster with the larger size! LAST TIP?! This place only has places to sit outside the shop. Literally a place for people to grab and go. Lots of birds outside for you to feed if you don't end up finishing your roll...they'll be waiting!!",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1359,5,"If you get ONE thing here, it's gotta be the lobster roll. I'm usually partial to the hot lobster roll versus cold, but wow, James Hook's lobster roll definitely has me leaning towards the other side. Just wow. The service here is efficient; you'll be in and out in a matter of minutes. As I mentioned, the lobster roll is cold with a mayonnaise base. The roll was heaping with some of the best lobster I've ever tasted in my life; it was sweet as good lobster should be and it definitely tasted very fresh. Quite possibly one of the best things I ate in Boston.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1360,4,"Stopped in here to get a lobster as advertised on the front of the building that says $8.99 a lb.

The lady at the counter said it was $30 for a 1.5 lb. lobster.So instead we got a cup of clam chowder!! Awesome!!Lots of clams, potatoes. Seasoned very well and very creamy. Would recommend-",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1361,5,"AHHH-MAZING! We got here early, around 10:45am, no lines! We had their Clam Chowda and Lobster Rolls. I am by no means a chowda expert, but... this has to be the best New England Clam Chowda we have ever eaten. It was thick, creamy, full of clams! The flavors were absolutely delicious! We even 2 large refrigerated ones to take back with us! The lobster roll was also fantastic! Was stuffed with fresh, sweet lobster meat. No fillers. No lettuce! The way it should be.

Lobster roll was kinda plain, drenched w/ mayo, PACKED with lobster. So you can pack your lobster roll, okay.. but you can't beat that bread and flavor at Luke's.Very small inside and tons of extra non sense to buy. Mostly souvenirs and seasonings.If you sit outside, beware...the patio closest to the door is where they wash port a potties so take caution!Get a patio spot FAR from the entrance AND...Just FYI..They DO run out of coleslaw.The potato salad is redskin potato's and again mayo overload it was fair at best. The quality of the seafood is top of the line and you can tell it's very fresh, But just not worth more than the 3-4 star rating. There just isn't much flavor and The whole experience was meh....LUKES though... on the other hand. Which we had yesterday. WOW.Trust me if you have only time to go for one. Go to Luke's. It's mind blowing!",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1363,4,"This was our first stop (food wise) in Boston. Long line but went quick and was worth the wait! Got two (a regular and large) lobster rolls, one for each of us and a potato salad. The lobster rolls were great, best I've ever had for sure. The potato salad was alright. The seating was limited cause it's small and busy. My main reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.. was the price. Lobster rolls seemed a little higher than just about anywhere else, and potato salad was very expensive too. Spent like $65 on lunch for this food. But.. just based off food alone was great! Go here",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1364,5,"This chowder set the spoon really high. Loved the chowder, made tasting other chowders in Boston difficult, as none paralleled. As for the roll, also very good. No skimping on the lobster. James Hook & Co. has indoor seating, as well as a huge patio space, some covered and some not. Along with their merchandise section, they also had coolers inside with things like lobster ravioli, and various foods to take home and cook.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1365,4,"Super expensive... but it's lobster, what else would you expect?

I wanted a snack to grab and go so I can have with my drink at the Intercontinental outdoor bar so we walked a few minutes to James Hook. We weren't really hungry so just ordered 1/2 pounds lobster claws and a crab cake. They packed us butter and lemon as well so don't forget to ask for it!. WOW... this was the best lobster I've ever had... I can't even put into words how different and how fresh it tasted from what I'm used to.. it was SOOO soft and tender and really broke apart in my mouth.. unlike lobster that I'm used to back at home where it's pretty tough and chewy. The crab cake was just ok because I wasn't a fan of the outside breading, but the inside was all crab meat! For the price you pay, you will get GREAT lobster. Doesn't even need to be warm or anything! It's perfect the way it is. I wish I bought a pound to bring back home :( I recommend just ordering lobster and nothing else.Tip: If you want a better view with your meal, take it to-go and walk over to the Intercontinental outdoor bar.

I know when you come to Boston a lobster roll and clam chowder are one of the first things everyone says you need to get-THIS is the place to go! It is a little expensive? Sure. But is it worth it? 100%!! You have to realize that quality, fresh lobster is not cheap. And with lobster rolls, you get what you pay for. James Hook will not disappoint. The lobster roll itself comes piled high with tons of lobster meat and the roll is so soft and buttery. You can order it with butter if you don't prefer mayo, but in my opinion GET THE MAYO. Your taste buds will thank you.Also, a MUST TRY is the clam chowder. Huge chunks of clam and potatoes with a rich creamy broth, it doesn't get much better.If you are visiting Boston for the first time this should be on the top of your to-do list!

The lobster is extremely fresh and comes in decadent, large, chunks. The meat is sweet and tender and the store makes a point of having the live lobsters in a tank where you can literally watch them getting taken back into the kitchen. The only downside to me was that the roll was off - I expected buttered, soft bread that takes a back seat to the lobster meat but it's served on a large, dry roll that almost feels like it's competing with the lobster for attention. Otherwise, delicious.",James Hook & Co,"15-17 Northern Ave Boston, MA 02110"1370,5,"Best warmed lobster roll! A must try!! Yes, beware they close at 3pm! I wish I would have eaten 2 of these!

You can actually see the old place next door. I do hope they rebuild. It truly is a hidden gem. A must try,will go back if I ever return to Boston. Of course,its outdoor patio style,but plenty of seating. Best to walk...fast service. Loved the outdoor patio. There is no price placed on good quality, this place has it nailed down.

I did not enjoy the food, the service was lackluster at best, and the ambience was rowdy. I felt like I paid upscale prices for complete mediocrity. Our table of 6 ordered the prime rib ($48), tajarin pasta ($32), pork chop ($38), pappardelle pasta ($31), lemon risotto ($25), and salmon ($35). I personally tasted the risotto and salmon.I'll start by saying that I have never been so at odds with a dish as when I first tasted the risotto. Though I liked that it was cooked well, the taste and smell was completely nauseating; every bite of it tasted like gorgonzola cheese and literally no other flavor was present. The soft shell crab was great, but the main portion of the dish was virtually inedible. I had to switch plates with my fiancÃ©e, and fortunately she was more understanding than I. The salmon, while certainly more edible and actually very decent, was over cooked. The skin was crispy, however, and the mashed potatoes and lima bean accompaniment were tasty. Still, the fish was leagues better than the risotto. I truly cannot wrap my mind around it, and everyone at the table agreed.The pappardelle pasta was serviceable and came with lamb in a meaty sauce. I'm told that it was okay -- nothing amazing, but definitely not bad. I also heard great things about the porkchop so I would recommend that. The prime rib also received very solid feedback.All in all I was severely disappointed in the evening. Service was generally very poor -- we saw the waitress maybe three times throughout the meal, and in intervals of what felt like twenty minutes. The gentleman refilling our waters was much more on time than our waitress. I can't recommend this restaurant in good conscience, and I wish I had chosen another venue to celebrate a special occasion.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel1377,4,"A great place to have dinner when you have guests from out of town! Not only because of its prime location inside the historical Liberty Hotel, but also because of its decent food and ambiance. Be sure to make a reservation if you come in a large group.The menu was primarily classic Italian dish. To start off, we opted in for the calamari and the prosciutto mozarella to share. For entree, I had the chilean sea bass which was delicious but not outstandingly special. We also shared the Friday night special at that time which was the suckling pig al forno - huge portion but found the meat to be a bit dry. My friend also tried the shortrib and it was decent.

I came here for lunch and after hearing the specials I decided on the Grilled Halibut with Â a Shrimp Risotto and Grilled Asparagus. My Halibut was seasoned perfectly, the inside was tender and flaked with a fork. The Shrimp Risotto was creamy and a nice accompaniment to the halibut along with the grilled asparagus . My sister-in-law had Skirt Steak with Yukon Gold, Red bliss hand mashed Chantilly Potatoes, Arugula Leaves, Autumn Quince. The Skirt Steak was tender and juicy, the Chantilly Mashed Potatoes had a twist with Parmesan cheese , heavy cream and lots of butter.

You can have a drink and take some great pictures.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel1380,5,"I came here for the first time for lunch during restaurant week. It is a swanky place right from when you walk into the hotel. Service was great, and everything was delicious and made well.For the $25 three course meal I chose: -Coconut Curry Soup (with shrimp): light, not spicy, and the perfect starter. Loved that they put the crispy shrimp on the side so that it would stay crispy until I put it into the soup. - Duck Confit (w/ risotto): Literally so freakin delicious. Duck was cooked to perfection (sauce is a tad salty but I'm pretty sensitive to salt). Risotto was smooth and delicious. Would recommend! -Cookie Plate: Personally I would pass in the future, and I wish I got the other options. There was nothing wrong with them but it just tasted like normal cookies (the lace one was my favorite though). I saw the other two options and they looked awesome. All in all would come again for lunch and dinner! Yum!",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel1381,2,"I am extremely disappointed to be leaving this review. Â I was so excited to come here based on how all the yelp reviews rav about it. But first off. If I'm spending hundreds of dollars at dinner, I feel like you can park my car for a lot less than 27 dollars. Or maybe even free? Valet was pretty steep. The ambiance was great and I loved seeing the open kitchen. We had like 8 waiters and non of them ever introduced themself and the one who finally took our order literally just said ""you know what you're having?"" And it was the first time we ever even saw her! Who do we ask for a drink, I can't even shout their names because they never told us!I do appreciate that they put our dessert order in early since we had a show to make at 730pm, but someone introduce yourself!The food was good but why the heck do they put the breadsticks on the table???at first we thought she dropped them but then realized, nope that's where they intended to put them!

My only criticism is that the buratta was fairly tight and not as runny as I like it. But otherwise this place is worth the trip. The Elephant Ear bread is worth the trip alone, the spaghetti with peppers and crackling was a beautifully flavored dish, my date and I split this order. The brick chicken was a strange selection for us, we never order chicken out, but this dish was so good I wish we hadn't split it! Â The place is loud and busy, the vibe is not quiet romantic but it all works. Excellent service from Jovan(sp).",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel1385,5,"Had one of my favorite meals ever here. What an original restaurant! The menu items are very unique and I loved every minute of this meal. When we first got to our table, they took a few pieces of breadsticks and literally laid them down right on the table and gave us some sauce. I knew I was in for something truly unique. The breadsticks were delicious and we ate every last bite of them. We also had the Spanish ham appetizer (sort of like prosciutto) and a scallop dish that was amazing. I wanted more.I did think about a steak, but when I saw a $44 Fish and Chips that included lobster, I had to try it. Could be the most unique take on a common dish I've ever seen. A piece of fish, which was great, perfectly cooked lobster with very unique sauces all over it, and super unique fries (I forget what it was, but it was not potato). Now, while eating it, I was thinking, this might be better with fries. But when I was done eating, and granted, I did have several appetizers which were delicious, I was super full. If they had put regular fries with it, it would probably have been too much. It ended up being perfect and I'll remember this meal forever.Scampo is a must!",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel1386,5,"Dinner at Scampo was lovely. The hotel it's located in (Liberty hotel) is stunning and historical and we stopped first at Alibi Bar next door for a quick drink Â before dinner.

I've never had a bad meal here.I'm writing this while I sit in a food coma, in my office, wrapped in a blanket in front of my space heater. I am happy to say the least. Let's recap:Service- always top-notch. Everyone is so knowledgeable and quick to make well-thought out recommendations based on your tastes. Being a vegetarian limits my menu selections, but I've never had a boring meal at Scampo. Food- delicious. I try to challenge myself to try something new with each visit. As of today, my favorite menu item is the homemade parsley cavatelli (without the pork rind powder) but I am sure that I'll find another favorite soon enough. It goes without saying that the pasta is absolutely unreal here. Drinks- strong and perfectly-executed. If you have an hour, check out their wine Bible, I mean list.Atmosphere- classy, upscale, and modern. The open kitchen in the center is a nice touch.

Normal, isn't it? Well... what's not normal is that instead of leaving the plate on the table they literally drop the sticks on the table... mmmm... I don't think I ever saw that in any of the good manners protocols out there... The ambience is nice and the brightness of the dinning room is just about right. Service is fine.Here's what we ordered:.- Fried Calamari: They were very good. The calamari were soft and tender and so fresh. I would personally have appreciated a little bit more crispiness on the outside but... overall a very successful appetizer. .- Crispy Cod: Very good as well. The cod was prepared beautifully and the dish did really deliver the crispiness its name was mentioning. I would certainly order it again..- Duck: I did not try it but my friend ensured me it was excellent. I can tell it looked amazing.",Scampo,Located in The Liberty Hotel1390,5,"We are staying in the Liberty and Scampo is such a highly rated restaurant we have check it out. We had a reservation for two at 5:30pm and we were seated promptly. My partner asked for recommendations from our waiter and he literally recommended 3/4 of the menu. We did a few appetizers. First was the mozzarella sampler. It had fresh mozzarella with prosciutto and figs, a balsamic glaze, arugula and a very slightly fried mozzarella slice. We also got the scallops, which were tiny, but came with a piece of pork belly and a thin slice of squash. Last, we got garlic bread. And it was delicious. A bit crunchy and grill toasted. They also place these thin crunchy Parmesan bread sticks on the table with a pine nut dip that is just delicious. Similar consistency to a watered down hummus. I loved that. I got the Sunday Dinner so I had a Caesar salad, stuffed shells with chicken parm, and a dessert. My chicken parm was good - their red sauce is great. The shells had a bit of sausage and cheese in them which I wasn't expecting but was really flavorful. The dessert was good. It was an ice cream Neapolitan. There was pistachio, cherry and cherry chocolate. I was the biggest fan of the pistachio (unexpected) and then the chocolate. I think it had some cherry in it. I don't like cherrys so I'm didn't try the middle one. My partner got the duck. He loved it. Seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The gnocchi that comes with it was a bit small but still flavorful. Unusual for us, we got drinks. I got a Bellini which I thought was good. My partner had some sangria which had so many complex flavor notes. I couldn't believe it. Overall, highly impressed.

This restaurant is not authentic Japanese nor any upscale quality service at all. Because of its location and interior, I expected high quality service but the servers are just ok nothing special. I had a salmon donburi and there were only 4 small prices of salmon and also they were not that fresh. The donburi rice was not seasoned enough so I had to use lots of soy sauce. My husband Michael got donkatsu donburi and it was so thin like a paper and there was no meat at all. It was overly fried, so very dry and chewy. I cannot believe they charge for this worse than a food court sushi box quality food for $25-$30. Very over priced for its quality. Seriously if you want some authentic and high qualify Japanese food go somewhere else. I would not recommend this place to anyone who I care.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"1397,2,"Major disappointment warning here. Â My wife and I went to Pabu for my birthday dinner recently and found that it was well below our expectations. Â I'm a huge Japanese food fan and I've been to some of the best in Boston, and around the world and I wouldn't even say that Pabu places on the ranking. Â This is truly unfortunate given all the hype around this place becoming the hot new sushi place in town. Setting: I'm actually a fan of the scene - subtle, cool distinctively Japanese. Â The restaurant is fairly large and has a good layout and bar area. Service: The waiter was friendly and attentive but definitely over-sold the omakase. Â I'd also say I wasn't a big fan of push for the up-charges on drinks and food.Food: We ordered the omakase with the promise that it was some of the Chef's best work with both on and off menu items. Â Sounds great, right? Â What we received was a mediocre set of dishes and sushi that could be found anywhere. Â I think I've had better sushi at grocery stores. Â I like to think of omakase as a chance for a chef to show off and set the bar - with this menu Pabu has set the bar extremely low. Â Everything was just rather boring with average quality that didn't match its prices. I know we would have been much better ordering straight off the menu (many of these items sounded better). We later contacted Pabu management (twice actually, with a phone call after an unreturned email) to express our dissatisfaction. Â The manager's response was a cold ""we've had mixed reviews on our omakase, thanks for the feedback"". Â I may not be a genius- but mixed reviews for a meal course is not a good thing - I've also been around customer service enough to know when to offer an apology versus defending your product/service. Â Overall, I'm disappointed that I bought into the hype around this celebrity chef owned restaurant. Â I really hope they improve, but I doubt I'd return.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"1398,5,"WHAT TO TRY??The omakase experience!! For $99 USD, you can try out some of their best fishes and nigiri. We came on a weekday to this restaurant that's located on the second floor. The restaurant has a nice modern decor but it's not a restaurant you need to dress up for, which is nice. The server who served us was really nice and sat us right by the window where we can see the bustling streets below. The omakase selection was nice. Started us off with some soft poached egg dish which was amazing before we got into Nigiris and ended us off with some mochi dessert. We were so happy with the fish selection, we ordered additional fish on top of the omakase. All the fish were really fresh and felt like they literally melted in my mouth. I liked the uniqueness of the mochi flavor too. Unlike the typical cherry blossom or matcha flvored, this mochi was caramel flavoured. LAST TIP?!You don't have to come try out the omakase, you can equally have a great experience ordering the fish separately. They have booths seating or even sushi bar seats if you want to have a closer look at the fresh fish served at this restaurant. Don't leave this restaurant without trying the omakase at least once!",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"1399,3,"Came for a group dinner in their private room. Had a great time celebrating one of our good friends but the meal and service in general were bumpy. They pace the courses really slowly... too slowly and we were all pretty hungry waiting. I think the server kept forgetting about my drink and it was accidentally spilled on someone but they didn't bring out another one until I ordered it again. And careful with the robatayaki. Ours were all undercooked and I'm not talking about the steak. I mean like the chicken and pork were all pink. Two of us caught it while everyone was busy scarfing down food but it was not just one plate that was underdone, all of them. The food is pretty good. The chicken out of the robatayaki was the best among our group and my personal favorite was the sea bass. When you're dining at a Michael Mina restaurant you kind of expect a more upscale experience especially with the price tag but they fell short on the finesse here.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"1400,4,"Very classy izakaya & sushi bar.

For one, the service was very slow--it was slow between every step of the eating out process (from ordering through paying), but there was also a long lull of about half an hour between when my hot entree (miso cod) came out and my two friends' sushi combos came out, by which point, my fish had gotten cold.On a positive note, we thought the restaurant was beautiful and admired the variety of seating options.Okay, back to the food (aka what really matters). We all did the Dine Out Boston dinner menu which includes two appetizers and one main dish for $38/per person.+ Happy Spoon: We all got this for our first appetizer choice. A small spoon of uni, ikura, tobiko, oyster, and ponzu creme fraiche--what's not to love? If I had paid the regular menu price for it though, I would've felt that the portion was too small for the price.- Maitake Mushroom Tempura: This was by far the worst item of the night. I chose this as my second appetizer and it was flavorless, crunchy (and not in the good, light-and-airy way you'd expect when you see ""tempura""), and oily. AVOID!- Miso-Cured Black Cod: To be honest, this was a big part of the reason why I wanted to try PABU for Dine Out Boston and unfortunately, I was so disappointed! Again, this was bland and lacking any of the signature caramelization that makes an excellent miso black cod. I was filled with regret as I watched my friends enjoy their Roll Combo.+ Roll Combo: Okay, so I didn't try this but I definitely coveted it. Both my friends raved about their scallop hand roll in particular!",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"1403,4,"Before I talk about the food, I need to give my server Damien a shout out.

He did periodically ask if our server came by and the answer was always noThe drink menu has a huge variety of Japanese liquors and some cocktails. Theres also a variety of sushi as well. But we opted to the main menu, the food was good but I would definitely come back and try more of the menu. The karrage, foie gras were my favorite dishes of the night.

Thought the salmon belly was sliced too thick but overall decent meal.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"1404,4,"Didn't have a single piece of sushi, but was still very happy with the Japanese cuisine. The gyozas were absolutely expert; some of the best I've ever had. The foie gras was ""interesting"", maybe a little too sweet, so I'll stick with traditional French preparations. The butter-bathed flank steak was absolutely phenomenal, and when they say ""butter-bathed"" - they are NOT kidding. The brown butter potato puree was super rich and flavorful, again; this place is not shy with the butter, which I am more than okay with.The vibe was pretty cool inside, and is authentically (as far as I know) decorated. I wish the restaurant was a little darker though, as I found it to be too bright inside.",PABU Boston,"3 Franklin St Boston, MA 02110"1405,5,"PABU was a gorgeous and DELICIOUS place to bring 60 of my VIP persons last night.Looking for an event location for an office Christmas party?

PABUs team right now is on point. Â Linchul gave a very special sake presentation/demo/tasting/class that many of my guests just thought was the highlight.

The ramen lover that I am, I had to try this place. But overall I was very disappointed.The ambiance and atmosphere of this restaurant is beautiful. Honestly one of the most beautiful restaurants I've been to. Hostess was very friendly. Took a while for our server to come but I wasn't bothered. My friend and I came here for one thing only: ramen. We love ramen and it exists in our blood. We always look forward to trying new ramen places, and we take our ramen very seriously.First red flag for me was that you had to pay for meat... Meat is always included in the price for literally every ramen place I've been to, so that was a turn off. I like how you can choose your toppings, but meat is never a topping. It's part of the meal... I got the shoyu ramen with the pork and an egg.Ramen overall was on the pricier side. Presentation was beautiful, I'll give them that. But the ramen was WAY too salty, and I love salt. I couldn't even finish the bowl of ramen, and if you know me that's saying a lot on its own. The pork and the egg were the saving grace of the bowl. But the most disappointing aspect of the meal was the noodles... I live for noodles, but not these noodles. The noodles were so STARCHY, it felt like I was eating straight up flour. I tried giving it more chances but the more I chewed the more I was disappointed.I would NOT come back here for the ramen, but I would try the sushi.

Texture is everything to me when it comes to scallops, and Tora did not disappoint. It doesn't come with sauce or anything because they are excellent on their own. The takoyaki came out piping hot and fresh. Between me and my friend, we shared the Gyu Don (sweet beef over rice) and the Nagahama Don (yellowtail, squid, mackerel, salmon, shrimp & uni). The fish was slightly chilled below room temp and the beef was very flavorful and mouth-watering! Even the wasabi was freshly made, thus a little milder.

I was really looking forward to that because it is a popular dish. However, the alternative I had was still amazing.The sushi was very fresh and nothing was salty or overdone in flavoring. Miso soup was on point and the pickled cucumbers was a nice touch next to the traditional ginger for cleansing your palette.The sushi rice could've been a little better in flavoring. It was very bland, however, I would take it over overdone rice.Prices are okay. Can't complain because it's similar to what you would get at a sushi restaurant if you ordered a chirashi bowl.I do love their playing and utensils. Very Japanese and elegant. I'm pretty sure their dishes cost them a lot. I love the subtle details they put into the restaurant.I would recommend people to go here for a sushi bowl. Perfect for a meal for one person.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1418,4,"I get cravings for good Japanese or Japanese-esque food when I am traveling. While I was in Boston, I looked for a good Japanese type restaurant, and this one seemed the most interesting to me. I as started to walk towards the location of the restaurant, I realized I was walking into China town. So, my hopes of this spot being authentic was pretty much gone, but that was ok.The restaurant is a few steps down from the street. The space is not too big, but enough amount of seating. A staff came to me as soon as I entered, and directed me to one of the bar seat since I was alone. He was very nice and polite. He also explained the menu for me since I have never been there before.For drink, I ordered Iced Yuzu Tea, sweet and ice cold, perfect on a hot day! For the food, I wanted their Kaisen Don. I didn't find the perfect bowl with the sashimi I wanted. So, I ended up with Sake Ikura Don with Tuna added on. The food came out super fast! It was quite nice, good portion, it certainly hit the spot.The staffs were all non-Japanese, but they were very polite and helpful. I felt welcomed and it was good, relaxing lunch. Again, the price point could get high based on what you want, but the sashimi was fresh and pretty good portion.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1419,4,"It took me forever to find this place, I'm pretty directionally challenged and not to mention you walk down some stairs in order to get to the space. First off it is in Boston's Chinatown it's kind of oblivious and probably why I missed it about 3 times. Once I got in I was promptly seated....I've been craving sushi for some time now and this place has some really good stuff going on! Not only are the bowls plentiful with sashimi style fish but they give you a really good amount of a little bit of everything in each bowl for whoever comes in. Everything was fresh and wonderful, also the nigiri was quiet good as well! I don't believe they have cocktails and maybe that's why it was somewhat empty but otherwise it was a solid choice for me and I'd come again.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1420,4,"Tora is a cute Japanese restaurant in Chinatown, and I would hands down recommend the dons over anything else here. The restaurant is relatively small with 5 tables and sushi bar seating. The staff are really nice and the food comes out fast.+UNI IKURA DON: Good amount of uni and ikura! Love the fishiness of the fish eggs in contrast with the creamy uni. +TORA DON: Lots of different kinds of fish. Great if you're looking for more variety in your bowl than just uni and ikura. +MATCHA CHEESECAKE: It's a small slice but it's dense and tasty! Tasty ending to a meal.-SPOT PRAWN NIGIRI: Not as sweet as sweet shrimp, and there's a meatier shrimp taste. Wouldn't get this over the sweet shrimp but just a matter of preference.-TORCHED SCALLOPS: Don't understand the liquid on the plate at all. Also, the scallop weren't torched enough, but glad that it still has the sweet scallop flavor. It was good because it was scallops but rather underwhelming as a dish. To note that the dons come with Japanese pickles and miso soup! All in all, would return for the uni ikura dons!",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1421,5,"Fast service and great quality food.

A small restaurant tucked in a basement, the seating is mostly around the bar. It's awesome to see the sushi being made. The unagi don was amazing -- it was soft, tender, and just the right amount of savory and sweet. It may not seem like a large portion, but it is so filling. The entree also comes with miso soup and Japanese pickle, both of which were good. The takoyaki was also great, coming in piping hot and full of seafood. Definitely a great place to visit for good Japanese food!",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1423,5,"Came here twice and was blown away each time. The location is pretty easy to miss as it's underground next to some of Chinatown's most popular spot. The gyudon was very good my first time and the second my friend and I shared the wagyu and the uni/salmon roe bowl and an order of takoyaki/matcha cheesecake. We were absolutely blown away by how delicious it was. The wagyu was so juicy and tender and with the salt sprinkled on top, it was just flavor overload! The uni and salmon roe were all delicious. The takoyaki and cheesecake were both great as well!

The fish they used was always fresh and of high quality, which is really important because it's served (mainly) raw. The downsides might be that since the place is small, oftentimes you'd be arranged to seat by the bar (which is nice, but personally I wouldn't say it's better than a real table). Also it can be a little pricy, especially considering the small serving. But in general, the quality of their food makes all these concerns insignificant.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1426,4,"Sashimi over a bed of sushi rice is a simple dish but what a delicious dish it is. Of course it's not just raw fish here. I've been here twice now, and the gyudon and kaisendons are delicious and insta worthy. The dons come with a miso soup and pickles. Personally, I'd prefer a little more variety to their cooked food don options (oyakodon!!) but the sushi bowl variety is great.If you're looking to try the wagyudon I would suggest waiting for it to be a special. It's $28 for 2oz of wagyu, though I'm not sure how that compares to the non special amount at $38 Service is quick here with a few tables and a countertop where you can eat and watch the chefs in action.

Eating at Tora was on the top of my to-do list during my most recent visit to Boston and it did not disappoint--in fact, I even dined here a second time.Chirashi and various donburis are one of my favorite things in the world. I tried their:+ Uni Ikura Don ($24) - Uni and ikura galore! Generous portion of both and the uni was very sweet and fresh+ Tokyo Don ($18) - Seared salmon, impressively-tender-squid sashimi, scallop, masago+ Maguro Toro Don ($22) - All three variations of tuna were delicious--the fatty tuna was melt-in-your-mouth amazing and even the leaner cut of tuna was super flavorful.

I eat a lot of Japanese food in the bay area and this little place was average. It's super tiny and seats maybe 30 pp. Prices were very reasonable and the service was great, the girls were super attentive. I got a sliced octopus and noodles, was not in a mood for sushi. The octopus was not as fresh as I expected and super chewy from being in the freezer too long.

Absolute great find for quality donburi and poke bowls amidst all the ""poke"" shops popping up around Boston.Tora is a basement level, sleek restaurant with gorgeous arrangements of fish! I ordered the torched scallops to start. They only have us 4 so was kind of disappointed considering it cost $10. The scallops were also cold which was fine but confused my mouth since I was expecting hot or warm from the ""torched"" description. For my meal I ordered K7 which had minced tuna, tuna sashimi, and torched sashimi! Great combination. The minced tuna went best with the mixed rice. My only complaint is that the serving size seemed to be in the smaller side.

Â I got the Sake/Salmon bowl with belly, classic sashimi, and minced salmon. Â The minced salmon was a little bit strange, gooey and sweet, but the belly and regular sashimi was DELICIOUS. Â The bowls are deceptively small but will most likely fill you up.Not a lot of seating, most of them in the ""bar"" around the kitchen which means you can see people preparing your meal.

After the whole poke bowl craze took over Boston, I was excited to see a more authentic version open up in Chinatown. The fish here is decent and the amount they give is fine. However, I judge sushi bowls largely based on the quality and taste of the rice, since you are basically eating a full bowl of rice and the rice here was not impressive. I ordered the wagyu don and tried the nagahama don. Again, the portions seemed fine. The wagyu was super tender and basically melted in your mouth, but since the bowl only comes with about 6 slices of wagyu, an egg, and rice, I felt myself eating plain rice most of the time. The rice wasn't flavored like you would find in some other Japanese restaurants. I felt like they could have added some sweetness or seasoning to the rice or at least added some other fillers in the bowl to add more flavor. The fish and meat quality were great, so if the rice was flavored, this meal would have been amazing.",Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1433,4,I came here with my mom for lunch on a Friday. The interior is small and minimalistic but beautiful. I like the wooden theme but I thought the tables were too small especially if you order a lot. I got the unagi don and I thought the eel tasted fresh. You get 3 huge pieces of eel over rice and eggs that look like noodles. Don't be fooled by the portions! It doesn't seem much but you definitely will get full!,Tora Japanese Restaurant,"20B Tyler St Boston, MA 02111"1434,4,"I came to Tora wanting some sushi after eating the typical white people food in Boston. I wanted something different and wanted to explore the chinatown area too.I ordered the Tokyo Don which comes with scallop, torched salmon belly, squid and flying fish roe.

I did really like the fact that the bowls come with an assortment of fish so you don't get bored eating it. Â I came here partly because I was on a business trip so I could expense the whole meal.

They ran out of the fried calamari so we just got the fried squid balls and braised beef noodle soup in medium spice.SO GOOD. I recommend and I'll be back. The fried squid balls were definitely a nice little side. Not too heavy despite them being fried and lightly seasoned. The braised beef noodle soup is so good, y'all have got to try it. The medium spice had sliced up, fresh red chili peppers and it was such a nice little touch. It added a good amount of spice to it and here and there, I'd accidentally eat a bit of it and it was so spicy. Medium is the way to go if you can a good amount spice! No extra sauce needed.

We both ordered spicy Taiwanese beef noodles and also had a oyster omelette (è_µä»”ç…_) for share. The broth of the noodles was savory and the beef was stewed so well that the tendon was soft and totally absorbed the tastes of the spices. The thickness of the noodles was also on point. As for the oyster omelette, the texture was a little more slimy than I expected, but still tasty in general. They also had boba tea, braised pig feet, braised pork rice bowl, wonton and some fried rice that I didn't get a chance to try. Definitely would come back when I get a chance.

I had the Braised Beef Noodle Soup and my husband had the Stir-Fried Udon Noodles. My Beef Noodle soup had very flavorful broth and was filling and very yummy. The stir fried udon noodles were okay but if we were to come again I would definitely get my husband to choose another dish. I also got the chance to try out the sea salt cream tea. My initial reaction was one of surprise because I was not expecting it to actually be salty. But once you've gotten a taste of the salty cream and then drank the refreshing green tea, the combination is absolutely amazing. I am craving it all over again!

I am a KFT fan, but their milk tea is comparable if not better. The pork belly was a rice plate dish, but I opted to get just an appetizer portion, not on the menu but they were able to accommodate it. The pork belly was the fall apart in your mouth kind of tender, braised with a soy sauce base. The beef noodle soup was flavorful, just had a small kick to it. I chose to skip the tendons in the soup and only have beef flank. The soup did not disappoint. The fish fillet was a bit of a let down, it was essentially fried fish on top of some white rice and then drizzled with ketchup. Skip.

We ordered three appetizers: scallion pancake with fried egg - this was rather unremarkable; sweet potato fries - nicely done; and what I would call chicken nuggets. Â For Main entrees, we had beef noodle soup and pork cutlet over rice. Â The beef in the noodle soup was very tender and the broth was well flavored. Â Pork cutlet over rice is a Taiwanese staple and I order it at every Taiwanese restaurant as a benchmark. Â The pork was nicely breaded and fried. Â It was accompanied by stir-fried cabbage and stewed turnip and radishes. Â I was hoping to see a hard-boiled egg which wasn't in their version.The food wasn't overwhelmingly spectacular. Â Maybe the place is more well-known for their beverages which took up half of the menu. Â If you're looking for authentic Taiwanese food, this would suffice, but it won't leave you longing for more.What really stood out here, however, was the friendly service.

I did not want to start eating without him but after 10 minutes, I felt very impatient because it was already 2:30pm.

No refills on water during the waiting period, in a stuffy room when it's 93F outside. I suspect they forgot to punch in our orders as I'd rather hope that was the reason. We observed confusion and fumbling around with order tickets as meals and beverages were frequently sent to wrong tables. Maybe it was a one-off day, but they cleary are understaffed.

What makes Dolphin Bay different from any other Asian restaurant in Boston is their authentic Taiwanese hospitality. No matter how busy they never ignore anyone arriving at their door, or waving at the table. Pros: 1. Authentic Taiwanese food with good portion size and reasonable price. Their rice dishes are super filling and comes with sides like steamed eggs, veggies, etc. 2. Very tempting appetizer menu featuring lots of Taiwanese street food, having someone that knows the food culture would defiantly be helpful here! A group of friends could also order a bunch appetizers here, sit and chill here with their bubble tea! They have amazing popcorn chicken! This is a very popular Taiwanese street food where they deep fry small pieces of chicken in a flavorful batter, tossed in some white pepper. The popcorn chicken at Dolphin Bay are a good size, meat is moist and seasoned, and you could add some hot chilly if you'd like! I also recommend trying their Wontons because it is made in house and they are the size they should be! The skin to meat ratio is perfect, if you really like wontons, their wonton soup is also a must try. 3. Gotta love their wonton soup! There is a lot and it comes in a big bowl (bigger than my face big) and there are a lot of wontons, a good amount of noodles and bak choy. 4. The beef noodles soup brings me back home to Taiwan! It has huge chucks of tender beef shank, beef tendons Â and the bowl is a hearty bowl of beef broth that is perfect in a cold day. 5. Their ground pork rice/noodles is also a must try. The Taiwanese method of cooking ground pork makes it perfect for topping rice and noodles. They actually sell tubs of this ground pork for you to bring home! 6. They're also very accommodating and they'll tell you what noodles are best for which soup! And if you have any questions and concerns they defiantly take it seriously and they'll come by to check that things have been done right. 7. This is a perfect lunch spot in between classes to get a good warm meal that's cool fresh and maybe even grab a drink to go.

This place just needs more seats..!!!!",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"1453,4,"Food:-The braised beef noodle soup is my favorite here(must get). You can adjust the spice level to your liking and it comes with an adequate amount of noodles and beef. They'll ask you if you want to do all beef or half beef half tendon. The tendon is perfect and melts in your mouth! -Popcorn chicken is okay, it's nothing outstanding but still taste good!Drinks:Their bubble tea is pretty decent however it's a bit pricey compared to any other bubble tea you can get down the street. Service:Every time I go in I've gotten great customer service. Typically I get seated immediately or at least acknowledged if it's busy and they're always friendly!",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"1454,4,"I went here for dinner with my friend this weekend. There were 3 empty tables(one with 4 chairs, one with a bench and two chairs, and one table with 2 chairs but next to a beam that blocked the space for a chair). They offered us only the latter table with 2 chairs next to the beam). Since it was cramped, they suggested we sit side by side. We asked if we could sit at the other tables but they said the table was for four people. Weird.Anyway, we ordered the popcorn chicken with mild spice, beef stuffed pancake, and spicy wonton noodles. The popcorn chicken was flavorful, not too salty. The beef pancake was great as well. The wonton noodles was a generous portion and delicious. It had about 6-7 wontons, green veggies and a touch of spice(not too spicy).For a drink, I got the sea salt foam jasmine green tea. They added a dolphin on top of the foam. Cute! The drink was very good and had a lot of tea flavor. The drink was not too sweet and with the salt, it balanced the flavor of the drink. At the end of the meal, one of the waitresses also gave us a stamp card for our drinks. After the 5th stamp, you get a free small pork fried rice. After the 10th stamp, you get a free drink. Nice touch!",Dolphin Bay,"72 Brighton Ave Boston, MA 02134"1455,5,"In a year that I've had some really great meals, my meal at SRV was my favorite meal. All the dishes we ordered were excellent, from apps to dessert. However, the pasta dishes were truly impressive. The pasta we had were Mezzaluna, Tajarin and Corzetti. As other reviewers mentioned, these moderate portions which I guess is typical of Venetian fare. All three pastas were innovative, unexpected, simple yet layered. Each had their own merits and stood out from one another. Ideally when visiting a restaurant, I want to experience something new in terms of flavors, style, ingredients, textures, or combination, and ideally, it tastes really good, too. We got that several times at SRV. I would return without hesitation!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1456,4,"We live down the street and first tried out SRV right after they opened. The service was poor, and the food was okay.We returned tonight to find MUCH improved service, and food. In particular the Parmesan biscuits and the crespella were fantastic.

Party of 7, made reservation in advance and was seated immediately. Tried a bunch of items off the menu, definitely recommend sharing a couple appetizers, and main courses. Stand outs were the chicken pasta (ravioli like). it had a kick of spice which was great. and the Nervetti Fritti. I remember the meatballs being good as well. Frutti di Mare Risotto was okay, a good amount of seafood, but the risotto felt a little runny.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1458,5,"Did not know what to expect and was blown away. Â Went back twice to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Â It wasn't. Â I'd put this in the Toro, little donkey, Neptune tier for boston, but at a much better value. Â The restaurant is beautiful, staff friendly and helpful. Â This place is underrated. Â Wine selection is great. Â Not a bad word to say - must try in Boston.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1459,4,"Came here with a group of co-workers after a client visit. We were greeted and seated immediately although we didn't love the fact that they seated our party of 5 at a table with one chair at the end. Space was fine but it definitely felt like they were keeping us from an empty seat at a 6 top, which isn't in line with top-notch service.I'll also add that while the service from our primary server was attentive (if cold), one of the servers bringing food dropped a portion of one of our dishes on the floor and was observed by someone in party noticing that he had dropped the food. Instead of immediately returning that plate to the kitchen he served it to us and did not even pick up the food on the floor until after.So... why does this review get 4 stars? The food.We all ordered the prix fixe menu, and were treated to a wide array of delicious offerings from the roasted carrots to the parmesan biscuits to the pasta dishes. All of our individual items were unique, flavorful, and together made for a disjointed if elaborate and surprising experience.With two in party having specific diets (one pork free, one vegetarian) they were able to provide the same level of flavor and variety; while that should be an expectation not a pleasant surprise, it's still appreciated.Our only food issue was the order of items: They served us two large bowls of pasta at the end of the meal, and while there was an extended time gap between our previous plates and the pasta plates, they were too large comparatively to the size (and amount) of the other plates and sadly went uneaten.One note about ambiance: While it was on the warmer side, the decor was tasteful without being showy and the space was full of noise without being loud. While our party enjoyed the soundtrack full of hip hop music, not all diners would necessarily appreciate a single style of music being played throughout the entire evening. Frankly it felt a little too clever and 'trying to be hip' for its own good though they know their typical clientele better than me.Ultimately I've hesitated to give this review 4 stars because I definitely don't want to perpetuate the all-too-common trend in restaurants where they can overcome poor or mediocre service with quality food: any truly excellent experience should be a blend of both, without one needing to cover for the other.That said, the poor choice of a single server shouldn't take 2 stars off what was a delicious and interesting meal in a pleasant atmosphere.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1460,4,As a New Yorker working in Boston for the last six years i've excepted and surrender to the fact that the stone in sooner eat past 9:30 PM. So on that now finding great cuisine it's hard here in the city however one of my friends Brooklyn New York or as myself told me to come to SRV this evening on the corner of mass Avenue in Columbus. As an Italian citizen living in New York for the last 20 years and coming to an Italian restaurant in Boston I'm surprise she know for the fact that you serve carpaccio with pretzels in it and I say why why and why it's wrong just remove them from the plate and on top of that fried potatoes not Italian stick to Italian cuisine. I have never heard carpaccio served with fries potatoes. John at substract edit serve carpaccio as it's meant Â to be served with arugula or pear shavings goat cheese blah blah blah.

So plates tend to be small but are they ever delicious! In Venice , Â it's customary to pop in for cicchetti (tapas) at a wine bar for small bites. This could happen as often as you like. SRV is Venetian inspired so, Â I had to have a few before dinner ;)). Â But they have a great prix fixe that includes a few snacks. Â I loved my last visit here and for under $50, I got Â their well composed cicchetti and small plates. Â Sold! Â Haha. The Food: Â If you don't know Venetian cuisine, SRV is the place to experience this food. Â Don't expect huge plates of pasta and cheese, or the typical Sicilian American plates you'll find at your fave North End hangout. Â I've been to Venezia over 20 times and the food here rocks over most cicchetti there. Plates are excellently flavored and layered deliciously. Â If you want larger, go for the Grani plates. Â Again, Northern Italian dining is not Buca or Maggianos type servings. Oh yah! Â And don't forget wine pairings!!! Â That's why you want to go for a cicchetti stop anyway. They have aptly available Italian and US wines to pair with the food here. Â Ask your server or somellier; Â I've had very competent help each visit. Service: Â Everyone looks like they love working here. I truly enjoyed Marsha's help and attentiveness. Thanks Marsha! You're too awesome!Visits: 3Tip: Â Reservations required or sit at available spaces at the bar or counter. Â It's packed here.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1462,4,"We were very satisfied with our dinner here this past Friday night. For a restaurant in the area it is in, I was surprised how spacious it was. The space is divided in half with a bar area on your right, a dining area to your left and a back patio (where we chose to sit) that offered a more intimate ambiance. There is a small patio area in the front as well with tables that would comfortably fit may 2-3 people. Great area if you're looking to enjoy a glass of wine. It is a wine bar after all! We, however, came here based on the food menu. We ordered two dishes from the cicchetti list which are basically small tapa dishes. The Polpette, or meatball, was delicious but definitely smaller than what I expected based on the pics from yelp. I don't remember the name of our second dish but I think it had tuna or salmon served with pickled cucumber on top. It was good but nothing to rave about.Onto the grani- we had the Tajarin and the Mafalde and both were amazing. Both the tajarin and mafalde were cooked more al dente than what we were used to but it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.The sugo in the mafalde was tender and complimented the sauce very well. The tajarin I thought was the best. So creamy and rich, I did not want it to end! Â As for dessert, we tried a sorbetti (kiwi) and a gelati (peruvian chocolate). If i can recall, their gelati/sorbettis are homemade. The peruvian chocolate gelati was just amazing. It reminded me of the Guylian seashell truffles but better. The sorbetti was okay but will try another flavor next time.Overall, friendly hosts and attentive staff. Parking is horrible so I would allot at least 30 mins to find parking on the street.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1463,4,"Really lovely atmosphere and interesting appetizers/small plates.On food - highly recommend trying a bunch of the cicchetti and the small plates/appetizers. Menu changes often, but there are always tons of interesting items and flavors. We started with the tuna belly and cod cicchetti, both of which were great! Very flavorful and a bit on the saltier side, which is how I like it. Then we had the chickpea polenta, which was so delicious and so special. Very eclectic mix of flavors and textures (slightly indian/mediterranean spices) - must get! We then had the tarjarin pasta and rigatoni ragu pasta. Both good, but I would probably go for 2 small plates and 1 pasta next time. Pastas weren't quite as special for me. They also have a pretty extensive italian wine menu. On atmosphere - A bit on the louder side, but lovely interior and nice garden outside in the back. They also open up the garage door in the front of the restaurant, which is really nice to get some fresh air in the summer. There is often a wait if you don't make reservations, but nice place to grab a drink out front while you wait.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1464,5,"12/17First I'd like to thank the folks at our favorite local restaurant, Sorghum&Salt, for taking the time to give us this recommendation. Their Sous Chef trained here, so I knew we were in for a treat! The decor is industrial and softly lit. Simple, clean and welcoming. We had numerous shared plates and nothing was less than brilliant! Attention to detail with excellent balance of flavors and bravely making humble vegetables the stars of the plate! It takes talent to do that! I love the unusual ingredients and the playful combinations of flavor. To put it simply, I want to taste something I'd have no clue how to replicate at home. Here, you will. We will be visiting Boston again, and we definitely will be coming back here for some more! Meanwhile, we can enjoy Sorghum&Salt wizardry! Lucky up and down the east coast!Side note - picture quality is sub par due to lighting. But I tried.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1465,5,"How do I feel about this place? You know when you've just discovered a new artist/singer who is amazingly good & you can't wonder how someone this good isn't famous but at the same time you're glad because you end up having them all to yourself?Yeah, that's exactly how.PROS:- See specifics below!- Great service!CONS:- I would definitely recommend a reservation ahead of time. They get good business here and there aren't that many tables available.- Some people complain that the servings are small for the price but you need to factor in the quality too. I have been to restaurants that were way more expensive but gave only typical of tourist food & I feel like the food here is of such a greater quality that I'm surprised they're not charging more.SPECIFICS:- Roasted Sunchokes = This 1st dish pretty much set the tone for the rest of dinner. The pairing with the sweetness of raisins & the apples were perfect. The apples, nuts, & sourdough bread gave the texture that fois gras lacks. I think the sourdough had a hint of cinnamon that really sneaks up on you in the back of your tongue and it was a welcomed surprise.- Ribeye = I never knew that meat could be so tender and soft until this. The ribeye felt like it melted in my mouth. The oxtail was perfectly done, & that's coming from someone who grew up in HK, in a culture that has perfected the marination of oxtail. They also added mint & that just elevated the entire dish to a whole new level. Never in my mind did I ever think to put them into one & after having tried this I can't help but wonder why in the world I had never thought of it before. It's just amazing!- Squash Casoncelli = I love cheese but ravioli has always been something I stand away from since it was just way too heavy to me. But having tried squash stuff-ravioli made me realize there was a whole new side of the ravioli world that I have never experienced and whenever I go to an italian restaurant I would always check the menu ahead of time to see if there was squash ravioli available. This casoncelli is a dumpling rather than ravioli, but the same logic applies. The squash was just as creamy as any other cheese substitute that I could think of and it didn't make me feel overstuffed. It also gave it this sweetness that cheese could never provide. On another note, the casoncelli shell was just perfectly done. It was thin but still strong enough to hold the stuffing together.- Lumache = The tomato sauce was well done, not too sour to pull away from the other flavors in play but still made its own stance. Not a single one of the small tomatoes it came with was sour (they know how and when to pick their ingredients). Great dish. My only complaint is that I wish they had given more snails because I love escargot. Special highlight was the squid ink breadcrumbs it was topped with. We couldn't for the life of us figure out what it was but it was so interesting and tasted so good we just had to ask the waiter.- Sopa Coada = The duck was, once again, done very well. The poached egg on top was an interesting addition but with every unique combination they've hit with us so far, this one was another good call. If it weren't for the poached egg, I might have thought the duck was a little too salty but wrapping it with the cabbage while soaked in the broken egg yolk was perfection. My absolute favorite about this was the picked green apple slices. I don't like green apples since they are too sour for me & I would've thought pickling them would make them even more sour but it brought out a sweetness in the apples that I never knew they had.- Pine Nut Semifreddo = I love concord grapes. They just have this unique taste that normal grapes can never get. I grew up with concord grape flavored candy from HK and the scoop of the sorbetto brought me back to my childhood. The pine nuts were also plentiful so they didn't skimp on ingredients even when they may be expensive. The thing that truly told me the chief knew what he was doing? The drizzle of peanut sauce. So creamy and rich. And it wasn't sweet! THAT'S how you know it's made by real peanuts since genuine peanut butter should not be sweet (it's all artificial sugars!).- Roasted Kiwi Sorbetto = Not my personal favorite of the night, just far too sour for me but my sister loved it.- Ricotta Cocoa Nib = I would have never known this was made out of ricotta because it tasted just like ice cream. The cocoa and pistachio were great. I would order this again.- Fior di Latte = Not the standout compared to the semifreddo but still very good. Creamy and sweet, just the way I like it. I only wish the quince jam was just a little sharper in flavor since the creaminess of the latte overwhelmed the jam a bit.Instagram @bowtiebowie for more food adventures!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1466,5,"We went there on a Saturday dinner and decided to get the arsenale menu (10 courses) and some cocktails. It was $45 for the whole course, and cocktails were about ~$12 range (Titus Sparrow, Corsinis Fortuna, Gateways to Riches). Gateways to riches was very fruity and light.The courses came out starting with small bites, and the portion gradually got bigger. I've attached photos for all the courses, so it is easier to gauge the portion of each course. FYI, I went there in a group of four, so some of the plates came out as family size so we can share among four, and some plates were meant for two people. The salmon dish and the second pasta with white sauce (forgot the name of it) were my two favorites. My husband really like the pork dish. Other dishes were also very tasty and unique in its own style. The ambiance can be good for date night. The waiter was external friendly and attentive. Will revisit when we come to Boston again.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1467,4,"Good spot. Got here at 5:30p on a Friday night without reservations and snagged two seats at the bar. Drink menu was creative and I ended up with a rum/Campari/coconut drink which strong and not too sweet which I appreciated as an end to the week. Ordered some small plates to share, an appetizer and an entrÃ©e. The meatball cicchetti was delicious!!! An order comes with two lamb/beef meatballs which are bite-sized but bursting with flavor. Also would recommend the buffalo mozzarella cicchetti and the olives. The appetizer was a cheese filled crepe topped with lamb (which actually wasn't as flavorful as expected) but there were so many creative and inventive options that it did not dissuade me from coming back and trying a new variety of dishes. The atmosphere was chic but not pretentious and the service was fantastic. Will definitely return.",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1468,5,"Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday on a Friday night and had an amazing experience! I made a reservation ahead of time with a few special requests and they were completely accommodating. Our waitress was super friendly and made sure we were happy. She even got us a bigger dessert for his birthday!I would highly recommend trying the tasting menu. Every plate was great and came at a good pace. We could tell that the chef put a lot of thought into each course. We ended up being pretty full after and it was definitely worth the price, especially for a special occasion.The space itself is beautiful and in a great location. Our reservation was at 5:30pm and it was pretty empty at that point so noise wasn't an issue. We also had a table in the corner, which was nice and private.

After two less than stellar experiences due to long wait times, I had a great experience this past Sunday. My parents were in town and are huge fans of Italian food, so I thought I would bring them to SRV. We were seated promptly at 730, and drinks came out fairly quickly. Food: honestly rarely disappoints. We had the mussels to start, which came with a nice extra basket of bread. Mussels were plentiful and fresh. We then shared the garganelli and the tortelli, both of which were flavorful and cooked to perfection. My parents loved them both. Finished the night with the tiramisu (I get this every time and I think it's incredible. Lady fingers melt in your mouth with a distinct but not overwhelming taste of rum, smooth and light; I could eat this forever) and the semifreddo. Overall, I really love this restaurant Â (my fourth time here!) And despite some rocky service in the past, the food and staff are outstanding. We will definitely continue to be loyal customers!",SRV Boston,"569 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02118"1471,5,"I've wanted to try SRV for quite some time, but the only times available were either very early or very late evening. We finally settled on an early 5pm dinner since we weren't sure when we'd be able to get reservations again. I'm so glad we went because this place did not disappoint! The decor is simple yet sophisticated at the same time. The overall ambiance was enjoyable and not at all noisy or crowded. There was a private party sectioned off behind the blue doors, but they didn't disrupt the rest of the diners at all. And now what we came here for: the food! Our waitress explained that the menu is broken up into three sections: bites (literally one bite), small plates, and larger plates, all to share. For bites, we ordered the potato croquettes and the special, octopus with celery root and olive. The croquettes were good (can't go wrong with deep fried potato) and the special was delicious. The octopus, celery root, and crumbled olives went really well together. For small plates, we ordered the sunchokes and stuffed squid. The sunchoke dish was very interesting and tasted like fall on a plate. You have your roasted root vegetable, chestnuts with cinnamon or nutmeg like spices, and a bit of shaved foie gras. The squid was stuffed with what looked like squid ink risotto and came with a kale salad, which was so good and really the star of the dishes. For the large plates, we shared the bauletti and octopus risotto. I'm not a huge fan of ravioli and bauletti was a ravioli type pasta, but that was my fault for not asking the waitress beforehand. We enjoyed the octopus in the risotto, but the risotto itself was ok. It's a tomato based dish, so maybe I just like the typical creamy risotto better. For dessert, we ordered the kiwi sorbet with coconut cream, ricotta cocoa nib gelato, and the coffee magic shell gelato. The ricotta and coffee magic shell gelatos were so good I wish I had savored then more rather than stuffing my face. The kiwi sorbet was ok, I'd pass on it next time.

Like a communal Italian dining room for several families. Loud, boisterous and happy people all around.After our wait we were seated and the food started coming very quickly. Bread and butter, oil, parmesan and red pepper flakes. Cans of soda. Then an uninspired salad drenched in dressing made me question maybe we had made a mistake here... ...and then the veal and chicken parm came and everything was resolved. Spectacular. Crispy, delicious, covered in a truly fantastic sauce and great stretchy cheese, this rivals anything in the North End or Federal Hill in Providence. Â Ironically, the decent portions of the proteins and a small side of (really great) pasta in that sauce made this special. Fantastic. In lousy restaurants they give you lots of pasta, it's cheap, to distract you from the average food. This dinner is so good, you wouldn't really miss the pasta. But you'll want Â more because it's so good. Normally the unevenness of the first parts of the meal would take this review down a star. But the main dish was so great I'm staying with five stars. Try it. You'll love it.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1486,5,Came here for a quick bite and the food and service was amazing. I had the ravioli with meatballs. I usually don't eat meat but these meatballs were the best I have ever had. Absolutely delicious! Thank you,Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1487,5,"We stumbled upon this little gem of a place because we initially were trying to go to another Italian restaurant nearby (won't name names) which doesn't take reservations and had a 1 hour wait!! We checked our phones to find something nearby and found Marios a short walk away with good reviews on Yelp - yay! So off we went. It is truly one of those little Mom and Pop neighborhood places where everyone knows your name. Â A good sign as we were entering the restaurant - a gentleman and his mother were leaving and highly recommended the food - they said they came by almost once every week. I asked the lady what her favorite dish was and she said everything's great.The interior as some of the photos show, takes you back in time a bit! The owner/chef Ursula was very nice and friendly. The other lady was also very nice. For appetizers we had - Burrata which was really nice and the melanzane (eggplant) which was good too. Entrees were - Veal Alla Ursula, Chicken Alla Ursula, Lobster ravioli, Lobster with linguine. All were really good. The alla ursula dishes are basically breaded meat and eggplant covered with marinara sauce. It was a lot of food especially after the bread and appetizers. Oh and every dish came with a side salad. The non-pasta dishes came with a side of pasta and sauce! Â For dessert we shared Tiramisu and gelato which was amazing!! Wow - I was so full and I had almost half my entree leftover!! Was glad to take home for lunch the next day lol.Ursula was super friendly, chatting us up, and I think she could tell we were not ""from the area"" regulars. She probably knows everyone that frequents this place! We stayed pretty much till the restaurant closed and as were all leaving outside, we saw her husband Mario drive up, and also chatted with him. Cute couple!! Would definitely recommend this homey place for good Italian food!!!",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1488,4,"The food here is really good. I haven't dined in, but I was really pleased with my takeout. I got a veal parmesan over pasta.When I arrived the attached treated me like family. I will be returning. Definitely give it a look it's a nice alternative to places in East Boston, like Rino's which ALWAYS has a wait.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1489,5,"We were staying near the airport and decided to eat here after reading the reviews on Yelp. Â This is a wonderful, family-owned restaurant with terrific food and gracious service. Â The pasta is all home-made, and I had an amazing dish with pancetta, my husband had the ravioli. Â The staff makes you feel like you are in your own home, and let you know they appreciate you being there. Â I'm so glad that the world still has restaurants like this and that not every eating establishment is fast food. Â We will definitely be back.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1490,5,"What a pleasant little restaurant! Â So super cute and quaint inside. Ursula is the hostess with the mostess. Â She makes an effort to visit and connect with every table. Â I had ursula dinner (chicken/eggplant parm), which was yummy and served with a small dish of ziti and a tangy tomato sauce. Â Everyone that came in the restaurant was from out of town - seemed to be people traveling through Logan airport - it was a little melting pot - people from Australia, business travelers from the midwest and those on their way to other places. Â A nice dining experience for an out of towner trying to get some local flavor :)",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1491,5,"I struggle because all restaurants do not exist for the same reason. Some seek ""fine dining"", then fail, and receive my 2 or a 3 star notation for their lack of success in the race they chose, but were ill-equipped, to run.Others pose as authentic this-or-that, and dumb it down for the masses. See some of my reviews for ""Thai"" joints where advertised ""5"" level pepper heat hovers somewhere in the low 2's, or where ""chicken breast"" is touted as somehow superior to the fatty thigh.Mario's is not in that game. It isn't posing. It's just waiting there on the corner like a new friend when you come to the neighborhood. Â It's the mom-(literally, Ursula) and-pop neighborhood restaurant for locals and occasional visitors to a somewhat un-touristy East Boston. Some gentrification is underway, but the area around Mario's remains largely untouched by the ravages of new money and IKEA.Now, to the restaurant. Ursula and her able assistant greeted us quickly and friendly, and we were immediately seated. The wine list is quite good for its range; a $32 Malbec was very good, as was a $7 last glass of Chianti. My daughter's Bolognese was a true rendition of what Marcela Hazan teaches us to make: just enough fat, just enough roughness, not too much tomato, and white wine simmered in. The Bolognese was accompanied by perfect handmade pappardelle. My wife's veal with seafood and vegetables was quite good as well: nothing was skimped and everything, including tender green lip mussels and succulent clams and shrimp, were spot on. My shrimp scampi was wonderful - 8 large shrimp, salty like the sea, and handmade linguine in a perfect lemon garlic broth.You can't miss the tiramisu. Do save a bit of room for dessert, please?And if they have burrata, dive right in.Ursula said it best as she turned away a couple before closing. Â ""I'm so sorry, I've run out of food. I cook everything fresh every day, and I've just run out."" If she can't do it right, she just won't let her standards down.What could be improved upon? The bread could be a little crustier, a little fresher. The butter could be not in the little packets. But maybe you should just use olive oil, instead, as the bread is suited better to a soak than a spread. That's what I'll do next time, because I'm coming back for sure.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1492,5,"Some colleagues and I are visiting town. We came into Mario's near closing time. Ursula was extremely accommodating and polite. She is a great host! To make things even better, the food is delicious. I will definitely return next time I am in town! Thank you so much!",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1493,5,"A recommendation from our hotel. Our table had the papardelle bolognese, house special gnocchi, and chicken parm. Fantastic. A few at our table also had cannoli and Tira Misu - also fantastic.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1494,5,"We found this place on accident. It looked like a nice place for lunch so we stopped. The atmosphere was great, quiet and homelike. The service was excellent, and the food was phenomenal. I was 1700 miles from Home but felt at home. A wonderful place. Next time I am in Boston I will certainly go black and eat again.",Mario's Restaurant,"347 Chelsea St Boston, MA 02128"1495,5,"I was delighted to get a Nift card for this spot, and was not disappointed whatsoever in my experience!From the incredibly friendly and interesting bartenders (I've never seen a crew have so much fun together while also providing fast but thoughtful service) to the delicious food (I found the pizza here to be far fresher than the Kendall Square branch) to the oddball atmosphere (several smaller vintage black-and-white TVs and several inflatable mini-flamingos lining the bar), this is was a delight. Think Delux Cafe but with more breathing room, pizza, and takes cards!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1496,3,"Came here with my girl friend for a girls night out. The ambiance is casual and modern. Definitely a place suitable for families, couples, and friends. They can accommodate groups and it's appropriate to bring children. We had wine by the glass and that was reasonable. The appetizers were good though portions are small. Recommend one appetizer a person unless you are ok with ""small plate"" amounts of food. We got a half order of the pasta in meat sauce and that was about 4 bites, so don't get the half portion for any meal if you expect to be satisfied. That being said, the pasta is freshly made and the sauce was delicious. Just not sure if it was worth $15.We shared the mushroom sauce pizza with mushrooms on top (forgot the name). About 6 slices. Crust was thin and crispy with a slight chew and it was well made. The toppings were good and not too much cheese and thus not too greasy. We'd recommend the pizza for sure. We got a complimentary dessert when our bill arrived. It was a vanilla and chocolate pudding made in house that was thick and delicious! Very rich and the sprinkle of sea salt was a great touch. Service was friendly and attentive. Just wish they had a little more to pick from on the menu for dinner.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1497,4,I love this place. This is my second time here using a Nift certificate. It was pretty quiet when we arrived but it was filling up by the time we left. They have a great drink menu. There beer on tap had so many local favorites. We got the meat lovers pizza which was very delicious. You can easy share a pizza between two people. I haven't tried anything else but the pizza on the menu but they have a variety of different options here. I will definitely be back.,Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1498,5,The shakshuka was delicious but the real highlight to this establishment is their outstanding service.

We actually ordered the pizza with no cheese, and it was still amazing and satiating. The sauce had a lot of flavor.. everything just tasted fresh!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1500,4,"Really good ambience, seating area. The pizzas are really authentic, wood fired.

Very nice place with good food and drinks, good for large groups.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1501,4,"Area Four is a blessing and a curse for me because I live so close to it. Can't decide on a brunch place? Great, I know where to go. All my favorite pizza delivery places are closed? Cool, I have a pretty good alternative. Convenience is key when it comes to my love affair with this place.I've ordered pizza twice from here and have been to brunch the same amount. Their pizza is good and of the artisan variety. Typically I need to be in the mood for that because it comes with a high sticker price, but their pizza is great. My favorite is the Carnivore, which is packed with Italian meats which bring it beyond your typical pepperoni pizza. Not my go-to when I'm craving classic, large pizzas, but Area Four knows what's up.As for brunch, this is really why I come here. I've been on two occasions, and I'm always satisfied. I've ordered the Hot Mess - which was a breakfast skillet sent from the gods Â - and the Hong Kong Waffle - which was basically dessert for brunch. Both were fantastic, and I'd jump at the chance to go again.Overall, great spot! Need to check them out for drinks soon. Darn. Guess I have to go back.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1502,4,"Stopped by for brunch/lunch on Saturday at around 11:15am. It wasn't too crowded since they open at 10:30, but it filled up quickly.They have a wide variety of drinks which is nice - interesting cocktails I haven't seen elsewhere. The brunch menu all looks delicious! I've also heard the pizzas are good and can be personal size or shared.I had the vegetable mess without cheese since I'm lactose intolerant, and they were very accommodating. That day the mess was served with a cranberry compote on top, which was delicious, and the tartness meshed with the natural sweetness of the vegetables and the richness of the egg. My friend had a lamb shakshuka which was special that day - it was really good and so was the pita bread that came with it. My other friend had the low country mess, which was great. The grits were deliciously cheesy and creamy.We ordered the fried apple on the side, which was fluffy and the right amount of sweet! The caramel sauce tasted a little bit alcoholic which went well with the fried batter and sour apple.It took a little while (30-40mins) to get our food, but our server was very nice.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1503,4,"I went to this restaurant based off a suggestion. They're known for their gourmet pizzas. Their pizzas and thin crust and don't have a lot of cheese (which is great!). The entire table got a variety of pizzas - sausage and banana peppers, sausage and lamb, mushroom, spinach and egg. I had a chance to try the sausage / banana peppers and the sausage / lamb pizzas. Between the two I preferred the sausage and banana peppers. It had a lot flavor and wasn't too spicy. I also had the small lamb tagliatelle which was delicious. I got the small plate and it was very small but the perfect size to also eat pizza. In addition their beer and cider selections are very good and all local.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1504,5,"This place is really good! If you come with a couple buddies and split a couple pizzas/sides, it's very fairly priced! The pizza here is great, probably the best I've ever had in Boston!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1505,3,"Four stars for the pizza and beer selection, three stars for a number of things. We've been here a couple times with a Nift, and a couple times without. Starting with the highs: there's a nice vibe, and some of their pizzas are really pretty amazing--loved the delicious carnivore, with lots of different types of flavorful meat. It had caraway seeds on the crust (yummm) and I'm pretty sure I tasted a little honey. Nice beers, too.And the lows: One frustration: the most recent time we wanted to use a nift, they said we had to be at the bar. From what I heard, a couple other surrounding tables had the same confusion since ""at the bar"" wasn't listed in the restrictions. If multiple people are making the same error, I would expect a classy institution to honor the ad and then change it to make it clearer in the future. The way it was handled just left a bad taste in our mouths. In general, we've had mixed service here--sometimes good, sometimes we've felt ignored. Coupled with somewhat mixed and sometimes overpriced food that isn't pizza (I'd skip the arancini; the flavors aren't as bold as you'd expect from sage and squash), my opinion is mixed, too.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1506,4,"It seems wrong to have area four (the name) outside of Cambridge. :)Great location, beautifully decorated, window let's in lots of sunshine.Good gluten free options - love that many egg dishes are made in their own cast iron pans. Friends loved their breakfast pizzas. Overall delicious. Fast service.And very accomodating to big groups (with reservation). The only negative is that they don't split checks, not even into 2 or 3 sub checks. Which is trouble for big groups or even when you're low on cash. But you can put in your card and specify amount to charge.",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1507,4,"My boyfriend and I ate at the bar here on a Friday night. The hostess, waiters, and bartenders were all exceptionally nice!! As 5 year olds stuck in adult bodies, we loved that they had Connect Four and Simon Says games at the bar (they were off to the side and the bartender said we could help ourselves when we asked). What a fun way to wait for food!The ""crispy cheddar and hot honey"" snack was delicious. I'm still dreaming about it. For anyone who likes the idea of fried balls of sharp melty cheese with accents of sweet honey, I say go for it!!We also shared the mushroom pie. I found it a bit bland - I added red pepper flakes and black pepper to give it more flavor. I think it just wasn't salty enough for my taste. I think the Banh Mi pie would have been the smarter choice!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1508,4,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. I have been to the Kendall location before, but the brunch menu in the South End is larger.I made a reservation for 2 people at 11 AM and was seated right away even though my friend wasn't there yet.The food was crazy good! We split the cinnamon bun with caramel bacon frosting. Whooeee! Probably could have split with 4 people, but 2 was just fine...! It was moist and delicious with extra frosting siting on the tray for dipping. It wasn't too bacony or caramely. It still tasted like a cinnamon bun with ""something extra"". Would definitely get this again.I was thinking about getting the breakfast sandwich or a pizza for my entree, but wanted to do something different and went with the Low Country Mess. The promise of shrimp, grits and andoullie sausage was too much to pass up. I made one change to the dish by asking for fried eggs instead of over easy/runny. The first time they brought it out, they forgot my fried egg request, but were very quick to bring me a new one.The dish was very good! There were 3 or 4 large shrimp, the sausage was nice and spicy and the saffron broth gave a great flavor and texture to the grits without drowning them. I was very happy with my choice.The server was a bit spacey and kept saying he would bring water and then forgetting. No biggie. It didn't mar my overall experience at all. I will definitely be back!",Area Four - Boston,"264 E Berkeley St Boston, MA 02118"1509,4,"I've come here twice, with a group of friends both times, and have come to the conclusion that I'll always leave here hungry. Ok maybe not hungry, but to be full, it would cost me way more than I'd like to spend at a pizza joint. My assumption is the price has to be higher due to the area.Fact #1: the food is delicious. We enjoyed everything we ordered during our last visit for brunch. The fried apples are so good, I could easily eat three plates of them. The pizzas are the main reason I return. The dough has a great char and just the right amount of chewiness. I've had the margarita, breakfast pizza, Florentine, and meat lover's and enjoyed them all equally. Fact #2: the portions are small and kinda overpriced. The pizzas are about $16-18 each and I can easily finish one by myself with room for more food. Each of the brunch entrees were about the size of a small appetizer plate. They did give us complimentary dessert in the form of little jars of chocolate pudding, boosting the Yelp review to four stars.Would I recommend this place?

All of the food I have tried here is delicious! I really enjoyed the Hong Kong waffle for brunch. I normally don't get a sweet dish for brunch, but when I saw that on the menu, I had to try it out. First things first, they got the batter down. It was fluffy and sweet and I love biting into the ""little eggies!"" And it really hit home to me when they topped it off with ice cream.

The ambiance and atmosphere is just as how it looks in the pictures~ very warm, elegant, and cozy. Service is good~ nothing super spectacular but our waiter was friendly and attentive. The restaurant is located in a central part of Boston, close to Copley, which is really convenient. If you're driving, be sure to park at the garage on Clarendon St~ they validate and it's only $5! It's a little bit of a walk, but for $5 it's worth it. As for the food, I was not disappointed. The reviews on yelp were high so I expected a good meal. For the appetizer I ordered these fried risotto balls. It comes with two. SO filling! The inside had mozzarella too so you can imagine how heavy this was. Nonetheless, it was delicious!! I don't know how I had room for my entree but I ordered the bolognese which apparently is one of their most popular dishes. Everything about it was great~ the sauce, the meat, the pasta itself. Definitely can see why people love it. As I was just about keeled over, my tiramisu for dessert came. I'm a huge dessert person and this cake was so decadent.

Best dish I've ever tasted in my life - truly! Also served with taglielle. Lamb chop is spectacular. Amazing wine list! Creme brulee is everything one would hope it to be. And the best salad I adored! What I like about each dish is the little details of flavors you wouldn't expect that simply cannot be found everywhere. Like the sprinkling of scallions on top of the pasta and flavored olive oil. Fennel with the beet salad and mango chutney. I cannot get over these dishes!The ambiance is beautiful and romantic with dim lighting, laid back, Â intimate, with light jazz in the background and candle lit tables. I can see that it's the perfect place for a date or a special occasion for that special someone in your life.

The service, the food, the atmosphere are wonderful at Da Vinci's. The standard menu is pretty pricey but if you go for Dine Out, it's quite a steal at $38 for 3 courses AND they have Dine Out Wine Specials so my friend and I split a bottle of red for something like $29.Foremost, they give you this amazing bread to start and you're served a mashed garlic chickpea dip and basil infused olive oil. Unbelievable both dips, I could've been happy filling up on this and bread alone.I ordered Arancini for my primi and they were heaven in a fried risotto fried rice ball. The outside was perfectly crisp and the tomato confit sauce with it was amazing. My only gripe was that I wish there was more sauce for me to dip the Arancini in as there was just a swipe of it across the bottom of the plate.For the secondi, I got the Gnocchi Crema di Zucchine and this was so frickin' good. Unreal potato dumplings which our waiter told us all pastas are made in-house. The zucchini flavor was lightly infused in the Parmiggiano cream sauce.Finally for my dolci, I got the Tiramisu al Pistacchio. The pistachio cream was amazing. Definitely had a little more creme brÃ»lÃ©e texture than standard cheesecake, but nonetheless a tasty treat.Overall, Da Vinci has made my list as one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Boston and I would definitely return again. Understandably it is pretty pricey but even with Dine Out portions (typically smaller than if you paid full price), I still had enough gnocchi leftover for another meal.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1523,2,"We came here tonight for Dine out Boston (restaurant week) and I was excited to get some house made pasta. As a table, we order the arancini and pomodoro e mozzerella. It was all okay, with the arancini the best in taste but the homemade mozz was meh.For the entrees, we got the sirloin, gnocchi, orrechiette, and tagliatelle. Sirloin was salty, tagliatelle was solid, and the gnocchi was tougher than what homemade gnocchi normally taste like. overall, I had high hopes, especially since everything looked so good. But again, the entree were just meh.For dessert we got the creme brulee, mango mousse, and tirmisu. The creme brulee certainly tasted like it was not freshly torched and came straight from the fridge. Mango mouse was solid, but mine has no berries on it as it read on the menu.Overall, I hope the reason the dinner was not the best was just that they prepared a lot en masse for restaurant week, but regardless they did not do well marketing the food for me to come back again. It's too bad because I really love great pasta, and they just didn't have great pasta tonight. :(",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1524,3,"Went for Valentine's Day Prix Fixe menu. It was around $90-$100 per person. Cancelling the reservation was almost not allowed as we would be charged $80 per person. It was an OK meal. The appetizers were a combination of different starters. They weren't too magnificent or too bad. I got the black trumpet gnocchi for the pasta. Then the lamb for the meats. Personally, I found the portions too large. Even for my boyfriend, who has a big appetite, the portions were too large. We had a hard time eating the lamb. By the time we got to the dessert, we really couldn't eat anymore. I wish they could control their portions a little more for the prix fixe menu. Personally, Da Vinci was a little underwhelming. We were expected better ambiance and quality/well-portioned food. However, the place was a bit crowded and the inside interior not as great. We needed up being way too full in the end, not knowing whether we enjoyed the meal or not.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1525,4,"Da Vinci's is a deliciously authentic Italian resturant in Boston that's not located in the North End.Have only been here once but was impressed with the overall ambiance, service, and professional touch this resturant evoked. Came here for a date, and place was the perfect setting. And if you like larger parties, there was a table of 14 sitting right behind us(company outing I presume).Can't remember what my gf had for dinner, but I ordered the bolognese as I do at most Italian restaurants I visit to see if it compares to the bolognese id get from a local aperitivo in Firenze. The bolognese was good, but nothing spectacular. That said it was authentic, and the rest of our appetizers were delicious.I would definitely come back and recommend for anyone looking for good Italian food outside of the crowded, overpriced north end.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1526,5,"The misses and I went to Da Vinci's after Wine Riot because we were drunk... We came in 30 minutes before the place close. I asked them were the kitchen closed because I could see the guy in the back cleaning up. Â The guy said no and he seated us. Even though the place was near closing we still got exceptional service. Â The misses had lamb and I had gnocchi. The misses said her lamb was amazing. My gnocchi was pretty good! I never had it with mushrooms but it was a nice touch. Overall the place was good, it's a little pricey but what you expect on a Saturday in Boston? Â I will be back.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1527,5,"I'm across the street from this place, but I never noticed Da Vinci until I was invited to a birthday dinner there. I didn't know what to expect from the restaurant at all, and it was well worth the surprise. The ambiance is romantic. Dark setting with glow up menus (like the da Vinci code) that would probably impress your date. The menu is signature, making it difficult for a foodie to decide what to order. I ended up getting the duck confit cooked two days, and I did not regret my decision at all. The duck was perfectly seared and the flavor balance was really nice. I usually hunk restaurants over-salt their dishes, but this restaurants seasoning was spot on!My only opportunity for the restaurant is their service. Attentiveness: 9/10. However, when I asked for what kind of wine would pair well with my dish, the server was sassy and not helpful. When we tasted the wines and I said I prefer the slightly cheaper one, he scoffed as if that were offensive. Our table had 5 or 6 bottles of wine all together, so I was kind of nerved by his condescending demeanor. I honestly don't think he knew what he was talking about.Tip: don't ask for wine advice. Didn't seem to be the forte. BUT the chef rocks and makes up for any of it.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1528,3,"Uhhh. Came here for Boston dine out. To start ordered the arancini which was good, but more like fried mozz.  Â  Â  Â  Second had the sausage and ear shaped pasta dish.... Here is where it gets bad. The pasta was very good,but the sausage was flavorless and overall dish was very bland and the chef must have a heavy hand on salt. Had to drink about 3 glasses of water after.  Â  Â  Â  For dessert I order the creme brulee, which was great! Â  Â  Â  Last the service. I had the bartender as my server who was nice but very unfrequently came to the table. I also sat for a while waigting for my food and finally my check. Once the check came I paid with cash and expected change back but instead the bartender took all of my cash as a tip. Service was not good at all!! Overall DaVinci's is your average Italian restaurant with prices that are too high for the food they put out. P.s the front hostess saved my experience. She was very friendly asked how my dinner was, when I told her it was ok she took the time to ask why and even recommend other dishes!",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1529,2,"Wtf Yelpers? Wow I'm not sure how this got rated so high. The place has a typical downtown feel, business lunch or client dinner but no real ambiance.The tomato and burrata was ok, tomato was not ripe or sweet, burrata was excellent though.The scallops were rubbery, not fresh and the entire dish was poorly executed, risotto was salty.The pasta was thick and undercooked, sauce was ok.Very dissatisfied with the entire experience.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1530,5,"Celebrated our anniversary there. The waiters were really kind, considerate and patient. The food was very particularly well made. A very interesting menu of some fusions. The serving size is HUGE. One antipasti, one secondi, and one dolce should be enough for two people. Da Vinci serves the most authentic espresso and it comes with almond biscotti. This is the best Italian thing I've tasted since my last visit to Italy. The environment was also really friendly and relaxing while it has a good standard.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1531,5,"Go here. Don't hesitate. That is all.Ok, a bit more. Wow, the Masala Ravioli is one of the most unique and delicious dishes I have ever had. Anywhere, on the planet. That's what my wife ordered. I had the Chicken Parm. Also one of the best. Nice atmosphere, superb food, great service.

My boyfriend and I spent 2 Valentines here and both times were wonderful experiences. I love their Valentine's Day prefixed menus, very reasonably priced for 2. I don't remember what I had last year but the food options for this year was plentiful! We had bread and 2 rounds of appetizers and got pretty full even before the entrees arrived! But we plowed through and of course ate and enjoyed everything. We're animals. They had great dessert options this year! Chocolate covered strawberries, tiramisu, AND creme brÃ»lÃ©e! *sigh dreamily* To top it off, the server gave us (ME!) a rose along with the check for Valentine's Day! They sure know how to make you feel special!",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1533,5,"We had a great experience at Da Vinci! I've been to a lot of restaurants around Back Bay as I've worked in the immediate area for 3+ years, yet I hadn't hear of Da Vinci. I love the fact that this place has outside seating, that's a huge plus for me especially when the weather is beautiful (which has been rare so far this summer with all the rain), so when the weather is great I take full advantage of it. The food was excellent and the service was superb! When my friends and I go to dinner we take our time and typically spend a few hours (approximately 3 hours - I know crazy) so we don't like being harassed every 5 minutes and asked if we need anything else. We had a great time and I will definitely be back.",Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1534,2,This place is all frills. It's very dark which is probably an attempt to make it fancy and to see the light up menus. The food is EXTREMELY overpriced and nothing special. Pour masala sauce over ravioli at home and get the same thing. I was looking forward to this so it was very disappointing. Service was okay.,Da Vinci,"162 Columbus Ave Boston, MA 02116"1535,5,"Hidden gem in Southie. Publico is a beautiful restaurant a few blocks away from the busy W Broadway. I came here with a few people on Sunday for brunch and it was a wonderful treat.There are tables inside, a U-shaped bar, and a few tables in this swanky, courtyard areaThe courtyard area is awesome. There is a retractable tarp/roof and heated lamps for the cold days We opted for the courtyard since it was nice out.I had the Bloody Mary and my bf had the Irish Breakfast for drinks. They were delicious! For appetizers, we had the bag of beignets and the papitas. The beignets were shaped like footballs. More crunchy than soft but I enjoyed it especially with the chocolate dipping sauce. The papitas were a nice fork tender and the creme fraiche was a wonderful compliment.For entrees, I had the special which was a Lobster Benedict (on a biscuit). My bf got the baked frittata (sub goat cheese for mozzarella). My sister had the arugula salad with steak and her bf had the Pop's steak and eggs. The lobster benedict was everything I hoped for an more. The eggs were beautifully poached. There was a good amount of lobster and the biscuit was buttery and soft. Needless to say, I inhaled it all. It came with potatoes as a side which were good but since I had that as an appetizer, I didn't eat it all. Had I known, I would have had salad as a side. My bf loved his frittata. He ate all of it. My sister enjoyed her salad as well though the steak was rarer than she would have preferred (medium rare). Her bf liked his steak and eggs.Overall, we had a great experience. I will definitely be back again. I am intrigued to see what Publico is like at night due to the booth set up in the courtyard. This could be a good hangout/drink spot.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"1536,4,"What a pleasant surprise!While in Boston seaport district, We were trying to Find something a little different and we were very happy with our choice of Publico. We took an Uber there and when they dropped us off it was a little strange it seems like it was in the middle of nowhere. We were there on a Sunday around 5 o'clock and it was a little bit dead and the atmosphere was very lacking at that time. We sat in the courtyard which is not really outside but it felt like it was. Our waitress was very friendly and do the menu very well. It was a nice mix of food and some of the things on the menu we really had no idea what they were so we were a bit adventurous. We started out with a special that was ceviche. It was fantastic! Very light and cooked perfectly. We also got grilled beets, Which were very juicy and we're on a nice bed of salad. I ordered the steak frites and I would absolutely recommend this if you are a steak eater. The steak pretty much melted in your mouth. Â My boyfriend got the roasted pork short ribs which had amazing flavor but if you don't like the texture of the bone and the fatty parts, You will not like this. The white beans that came with it were fantastic. My friend that I was with ordered the grilled trumpet mushrooms, This was a very large plate and We would definitely recommend this Â for any vegetarian. There was a ton of quinoa that came with this and the squash was very good as well. After dinner, we asked if they could make Mexican coffee and the bartender was very happy to accommodate us. It was a little out of the way of anything, but if you go to Lawn on D, it is like a 10 min walk and fun to stop at prior.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"1537,5,"So much fun.We came here on a Saturday evening, made a reservation and were seated right away. Service was wonderful. They were super attentive and quick and answered all our questions. Most of my table got the lobster mac and cheese which is quiet large even though its on the app side. I got the Baja Fish tacos which were soo good. One of the better fish tacos I've had. They also have a number of Gluten Free items and vegan items. The drinks were very tasty.

It wasn't a bad experience. The atmosphere was actually pretty cool and service was good, but the portions were small and the food was overpriced and alright at best. Nothing special. My husband and I shared the burger and short ribs, and for a $17 burger and $26 plate it definitely wasn't worth it. It is nice that they have private rooms for large parties. I called to see if I could reserve one on a different occasion, but the minimum to book the room was ridiculous so I opted out.

We made reservations beforehand and receive the high tables in the center of the courtyard-like room under the greenery. It was empty enough on a Sunday at noon that we would have been seated regardless, but probably not at the nicer high tables. Our table ordered the breakfast for champions which is a huge bottle of champagne and three fruit purees to mix your own mimosa. I thought that was pretty fun.The only fault: I ordered the ceviche and Russian Spy Bloody Mary which I didn't think was super special.

It feels as though theres 3 different themes going on inside: a unique dining areas that gives off Latin vibes, a modern city bar, and the beautiful urban garden in the back of the restaurant. Not going to lie, I really wanted to come here for the garden. Note that the garden is first come first served!The food is a mix of Latin, European and American. We tried all the snacks: sourdough buns, bacalao fritters, empanadas, tacos, and perrito caliente. I loved the perrito caliente, hotdog on soft warm buns garnished with chili, salsa, bacon bits and drizzled over with a light mayo. As simple as this sounds, it was really good. The empanadas and bacalao fritters (cod fritters) are also good and worth ordering. I would skip the sourdough buns and tacos since they were very plain/unoriginal.My favorites had to be the ceviche and mais crepes (corn crepes). The ceviche was one of the best I've ever had and worth every penny! The seafood was fresh and light yet seasoned perfectly. The mais crepes was very unique, I love the sweetness of the corn mixed the sharp and tart flavors from the radish and relish. The only downside to the crepes is that it is very mushy in texture and if you don't like that, this may not appeal to you. Steamed mussels, bolognese, and steak frites were all very boring and not impressive at all so I don't recommend any of these. Drinks were okay; their cocktails feature not so well known liquors so everything sounded interesting. I tried the luchador and I would recommend that to anyone who likes light and refreshing drinks. Similar to a mojito but with ginger.",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"1546,5,New restaurant that recently opened up in the area. Large dining area with plenty of tables and chairs. The other room is an enclosed outdoor area perfect for warm Boston days. This place filled up quickly right after we got there so I suggest making a reservation. Besides their short water glasses which would need a refill every 2 minutes; the meal was perfect. The Ceviche was excellent and the Mahi Mahi's sauce was A-mazing! The giant pieces of corn threw me off but they were pretty delicious. The brussel sprouts were baked well too. The pieces of chopped pork gave it that extra flavor.,Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"1547,5,"I love this hidden southie gem. I'm a regular here for brunch.

Awesome drinks, great food!",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"1548,4,"First impression is the space is beautiful, inside and out. I personally like that it's not on the main street which makes it more special and unique. The restaurant is connected to a luxury apartment building, which is super convenient for residents so they can enjoy the outdoor patio area in the middle of the restaurant with the fire pits, and an outdoor bar which will be a great spot when it warms up. If not, there's still a large bar in the inside of the restaurant. That being said, the bar is in one section, and on the other side are the majority of the tables and the lighting got increasingly darker which I think ended up being a little too dark towards the end since I couldn't really see my food lol.We came the Friday of opening week with an early reservation, and the place was completely packed within an hour and a half. Some new opening kinks were definitely noticeable. I felt like our waitress could have been more attentive since in our party of four, two showed up much later and even though we were asked about drinks in the very beginning, we wanted to order an app to get started and we had to wait a bit.Drinks were absolutely delicious, I got the Vicero that came with pisco, and it's a little on the smaller side but very tasty. I really enjoyed the Lucador too that had a fresh, cucumber flavor but the hint of ginger really made it unique.For food, we got the tacos to start as apps, and these came with tartare and on the tinier side, but the two that were served had a decent amount of tartare. We also got the pollo asado which was extremely tender and the flavor was just right! The options reminded me of authentic latino food, although their menu is considered ""global latino and european food"" I definitely preferred the ones with more latino influence. It seemed like a lot of people ordered the steak frites and that entree was huge. Not sure about the taste, but in terms of size, that entree seemed worth the price. We also got grilled trumpet mushrooms, great vegetarian option!",Publico Street Bistro & Garden,"11 Dorchester St Boston, MA 02127"1549,5,"I love Publico!

The waffle is lightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, PERFECT! I got a side of home fries, which is a VERY generous amount. I also had an iced coffee.

The pancakes looked golden and fluffy and I was really excited to try it but it came as a disappointment. I've had better breakfast elsewhere and most likely will not return.

However, finding a breakfast spot that is open at 6 am can prove quite challenging, especially if you don't want to drive too far from the airport. Theo's is a small Italian joint that is open at the crack of dawn, and they are a great spot to satiate your early morning breakfast hankering.You know things are going to be good when you open the door and are intoxicated by the smell of fresh roasting seasoned home fries. Â There are a lot of great options on the menu, but I highly recommend the Hot Italian Sausage and Provolone Cheese omelet. The omelet itself takes up the entire plate's width one way and essentially fills up half of a plate. It is chock full of delicious sausage and melted provolone. It comes with a very hearty serving of the aforementioned home fries, which have a fabulous flavor and a nice mix of soft and crispy textures. You also get your choice of toast, and I generally go with raisin (though they have quite a few options).The place is small, and I imagine it gets quite busy as the morning creeps into normal breakfast hours. Even at the early hour we arrived, there were quite a few folks who began filing in. The service is lightweight but fine, and the food comes out reasonably fast. They do serve lunch, and the options there are decidedly more Italian, but I have never ventured there for anything other than an early morning breakfast. However, if an early morning breakfast is what you desire, then Theo's is an amazing choice. Make sure you bring cash, though, as they don't accept plastic.",Theo's Cozy Corner,"162 Salem St Boston, MA 02113"1571,5,"Great breakfast spot in a nice ""cozy"" setting.

It was humid-less summer afternoon so I took the opportunity to take my friends to Redd's for dinner and drinks out on their patio. To our surprise, the gate was locked and chairs were stacked on top of tables. Apparently, Redd's is only open on Sundays for brunch and closes after 3p. My friends were hangry and looked to me to rectify this situation and I did just that when I opened my handy dandy Yelp app to find this ""hot new restaurant."" 753 South has an equally cute of a patio dining area as Redd's with dangling string lights and all. Food was fantastic too. I wasn't too hungry so I didn't get the brick chicken the other reviews mention. Instead I ordered the Cuban sandwich. The Cuban was slightly oily but the flavors were just right. Plus, I loved that there was plenty of pickles inside the sandwich and on the side! My friends got the burger and the walnut apple salad and both really liked their food. In fact, my eyes kept wandering to other tables because all the food looked so good!

We had the Thai chili wings to start, really yummy and I loved the pickled jalapeÃ±os. Next we had the steak tips, chicken under and brick, Cuban, and the salmon. By far, the best was the chicken under a brick, it was outstanding. The steak tips were huge and delicious. The salmon was fine but not very exciting and the Cuban was just ok.

It did not disappoint. It was the perfect comfort food I needed after a busy day at work. The fry on the oysters was done well, and the side of fries definitely pleased. The cornbread, however, was the real gem here. It packed a lot flavor, had the perfect texture - good crust on the outside and a soft inside - and the melted butter on top made it some of the best cornbread I have eaten.

I loved the set up, they fit so many tables in there but there are section dividers so you're not on top of everyone all the time, you really feel like you're having an intimate meal.The food of course was delicious. My absolute favorite was the salmon on fire appetizer - fresh salmon roasts over open flames on a bamboo rod, and you get to pick how long it cooks by blowing out the flame. Absolutely the best presentation of the night and tasted as good as it looked!All of the rolls we tried were delicious, but fair warning they're pretty sizable. I was expecting 6 pieces but most rolls had at least 8 or 12 pieces - come hungry!Dessert was delicious as well - I tried the red bean creme brulee and it was well worth it.All in all Oishii is a fantastic restaurant and I can't wait to go back!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1596,5,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in boston. The sushi and sashimi is very fresh, the service is amazing. and the not only is the presentation superb but so is the taste. Sushi: I usually get a few pieces of sushi and sashimi ala carte - salmon belly, baby yellowtail,tuna belly. i also recommend a toro truffle roll (recommend to hold the truffle oil as it can get a little salty). When you order otoro or uni sashimi, sometimes they sprinkle gold flakes on your order to spice up the presentation!Appetizers: If you're on a date and want a wow factor, the tuna tartare comes in a block of ice and the salmon on fire really puts on a show. to take it over the top, the wagyu hot stone will be a unique experience in itself.Meat: As for hot dishes/main courses, the teriyaki steak has a generous portion when compared to most japanese dish sizes. its very tender and full of flavor. If you want to splurge, I'd recommend the A5 wagyu to share - eating one alone is possible but the meat is super rich and you may get tired of it after a few bites.Fish: They used to have an otoro rissoto that was my favorite dish. the chilean sea bass is pretty good, as well as the miso yaki (black cod).",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1597,5,One of the best meals I've had in Boston! Â We decided to impromptu treat ourselves last night. Don't let the open table reservations scare you - I called and they said there was plenty of seating in the lounge and sushi area. We started with some delicious miso soup. There was so much flavor packed in and some of the best I've had. We got the Wagyu beef tartar. It was pretty good. I don't think it was as amazing as I was expecting. It did taste a lot of sour cream and onion chips which was surprising. The quail egg was beautiful on top. Â We also had the king crab dumplings. There were only two dumplings which surprised me for a $12 dish. The broth the dumplings sat in was sooo delicious. I wanted to slurp it all up. Make sure to take a bite of the dumpling and go back to dip it in the broth for the next one. There was a good amount of crab. It was very delicious. We got three maki. The torched was our favorite by far. Very creamy and a delicious and surprising amount of scallop on top. The white tiger was very good. The sauce was delicious. The wasabi could have been a little stronger. I kept having to add more and more. Then we finished with the king salmon roll. It was also very good with a lot of tobiko inside. We finished our meal with the squid ink pasta. I'm very glad we got this even though we were very full. It was so buttery and delicious. The calamari was very plump and had been marinated in gorgeous buttery and garlic flavors. This pasta and the torched roll were by far my favorite parts.,Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1598,5,"Incredibly expensive but worth at least... one trip. We got a handful of dishes, ranging from the coconut sphere for desert, some sashimi and some of the maki. The pork belly was probably some of the most fatty pork belly I've ever had, but wow it was amazing. I'd highly recommend if you're a fan of pork belly.The coconut sphere was fantastic, I was hesitant to get it as we were both full, and I'm not a huge fan of deserts, but it was an explosion of flavor when you eat the entire piece in one bite. I *highly* recommend ordering this dish, and saving just a little bit of room for it. The service was decent, they didn't come by quite as often as I would like but they were polite and responsive when we did need things.One dish I was pleasantly surprised by was the wagyu beef maki. I've only had beef on a roll once and it tasted exactly like I thought it would. This dish, however, was different and incredible. I almost ordered it twice. I think the combination of a high quality meat, plus the other garnishes that they add in actually make it taste like more of a rice/meat dish than a sushi roll. I'd recommend coming here (and O-Ya of course) if you like sushi and are not on a budget.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1599,5,"Wow amazing. Worth visiting over and over again.

Her welcoming spirit & knowledge of all the menus was an extra plus, in addition to her presence always on time.I kept my ordering pretty simple with the California/Vegetable Rolls & tasty order of SautÃ©ed Mushroom. My WomanBaby had the Teriyaki Chicken that was literally two marinated wings that was prepared braised style & stated they were a tad bit burnt. We also had the Vegetable Noodles that was plentiful for the both of us to enjoy.

Good first impression, but Oishii really amazed me on my second visit.What makes Oishii stand out from all the other high-end sushi restaurants in Boston is the menu. Not only is it diverse, but you'll see exquisite plates here that you won't see anywhere else.For instance, the ***OCTOPUS CARPACCIO*** (citrus vinaigrette, jalapeÃ±o chips & granny smith apple).At first, you might think: octopus and apple, whaaatt? But this is a must-try! I was impressed by how well they go together. I appreciate the creativity and utter genius of each of the plates Oishii offers.My other recommendations:- TORO TARTARE: ossetra caviar, crispy shallots served in an ice block- WAGYU BEEF TATAKI: micro cilantro, crispy shallots & pickled red onion- LAMB CHOP: cut double thick, shiitake truffle sauce & crispy thymeOh, and any of the tuna toros are heavenly.Amazing food, very innovative. Great quality, excellent service. Nice ambience. Overall a delightful treat, and a five-star review from me. Will be back!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1602,5,"I went here recently for an anniversary dinner and we arrived a bit earlier than expected. However, the staff was very kind and seated us early. I have to say customer service was great! We were unfamiliar with the menu because we've never been, so they were patient and explained to us what was on the menu. They were also very tentative in the sense that they always came over to check up on us to make sure everything was going well.We ordered more than what was pictured (the salmon on fire and something else). Everything tasted absolutely amazing, but the pork belly buns. I thought the meat was a bit dry and the sauce was too salty. But everything else was great!

You can find both high quality ""traditional"" nigiri/sashimi and fancy makis as well as a variety of Asian-fusion appetizers/small plates - there's something for everyone! My absolute favorite dish at Oishii is the O-toro truffle risotto. For some reason, the dish is no longer listed on the official menu. However, when I asked for it during my most recent visit, the waitress gladly checked with the kitchen and was able to have it made for us! We had to order 2 orders of it - it's that good (although pricey at $35 per dish). It comes with 3 thick slices of fatty tuna (just melts in your mouth) topped with a generous amount of truffle and gold flakes, served with mushroom risotto on the side. The mixture of texture and flavor was so heavenly (even just to think about it!!).I would also recommend the Lobster dumplings (they are fried dumplings filled with chunks of lobsters and cream cheese, served with a plum/soy dipping sauce), as well as the Uni pasta topped with a poached duck egg (the texture of the pasta is very unique). Oh, and don't forget to get the Green Tea Layer Cake for dessert (it's like Lady M crepe cakes, but I personally think it's better)!!I always prefer to sit at the sushi counter as I'm so fascinated and amazed at how the chefs turn simple ingredients into delicious dishes that are also beautifully presented!

My mouth is watering just thinking about it now.-Sakura Smoked Hamachi: This was good but not as memorable as the 2 dishes above. -Wagyu Beef Ishiyaki: you cook this on a hot stone which was cool. Wagyu is always good so no complaints here. For entrees: -Squid Ink Noodles: I didn't know what to expect but it was really good.

The wagyubeef on hotstone was disastrous. It was not chewable and not like wagyu beef at all and it had the price of 60 dollars.

Conclusion: over priced food is not even that good,Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1606,2,"Don't sit in the basement! I went with a friend and we both had omakase. The atmosphere was really lacking and we were treated like second class citizens although our dinner was well over $200. The fish was good but nothing spectacular. I wish I was able to sit in the main room....I am subtracting a star based on the conversation I heard at the table next to us. A group of young people ordered a bottle of sake, it was brought to their table, opened, poured... but before anyone had any, they realized the server brought the wrong bottle... not what they had ordered. The group politely asked for the bottle they initially wanted but after a few trips back and forth, the server told them that because the restaurant already opened it, they would have to pay for it and drink it. The folks at the table were about 22 and Asian. I would have not accepted those terms... it seems ridiculous, but that's the way the restaurant handled it. The patrons were basically coaxed into ""dealing with it"", while dropping at least three Benjamins on their meal. That's literally bullshit customer service.Verdict: Skip it. Go to a regular sushi place and don't pay so much for a good high end atmosphere. That doesn't exist at this place. Yes, I like omakase and exotic fish but I would rather get a ticket to California and savor the badass sushi in the Bay over trying to find it in Boston.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1607,5,"Items ordered: Smoked Tuna Tataki, Pork belly buns appetizer, White tiger roll, Toro Truffle roll, Lobster lettuce rollPros:- Unique items on the menu that I've never seen at other sushi restaurants. The Smoked tuna appetizer came in a bell jar filled with cedar smoke that gave the tuna a taste reminiscent of smores. The white tiger roll was wrapped in white seaweed with black stripes. - I've been to several sushi restaurants in Vancouver and they don't compare with the artistry and flavour of the food here. - Modern decor with low noise levels, I saw many people here on dates or business dinner. - I don't recommend using soy sauce at all as the rolls comes with their own taste and sauces. Cons: - I would not recommend the Lobster lettuce roll, it was good but compared to the others, it was underwhelming for the price ($17). It was also harder to eat given its diameter and the lobster flavour was masked by all the lettuce and cucumber.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1608,5,"Oishii is probably one of my friend's and my favorite Japanese restaurants in Boston.

They also gave us a complimentary appetizer of edamame mousse which was also good.For dessert, I got the read bean crÃ¨me brulee which is also very tasty.It was busy even on a Sunday night.. A lot of other parties also order the Salmon on Fire which looked pretty good. Hope to try that next time!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1611,4,"Been wanting to try this place for awhile, and we finally made it for lunch. Very nice ambiance with dim lighting and modern Japanese design. We ordered the Salmon on Fire as an appetizer. It's four strips of raw salmon over a wooden stand and comes to your table with a flame underneath it which you blow out after 10 seconds. Presentation is excellent, and the salmon itself was fresh and perfectly marinaded. For rolls, we ordered the Toro Truffle, Oishii Sashimi, and White Tiger. The Oishii Sashimi was my favorite- it's wrapped in cucumber instead of seaweed and was very refreshing. The Toro Truffle roll, however, was way too salty for my taste. This place is definitely on the pricier end, but with the excellent and attentive customer service, quality of the food, and the effort put into presentation, it's well worth the price.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1612,3,"More of a 3.5 stars: We were here for lunch and we ordered the chicken teriyaki, spicy seafood udon, chicken fried rice, oishii sashimi maki, and red bean creme brÃ»lÃ©e. We use to come here a lot around 1-2 years ago but came less because we felt the quality was starting to decline. Coming back today, we noticed that the menu has changed from the past and it appears that some dishes we use to have are no longer on the list. The Maki's are still good, we still like them very much but the entrees use to be better, especially for its price. The chicken teriyaki was very dry and rubbery, definitely not pleasant to eat. The teriyaki sauce seemed pretty generic as well, something we might be able to buy at a grocery store. The seafood noodles had some seafood but much more fish cakes and those frozen seafood type things (not sure what they're called). The fried rice was nice and tasty, but it was the size of one regular rice bowl. For $18 I believe, they definitely could've used more carefully selected ingredients or at least given more. The freshness and taste of the fish used in sashimi/nigiri is good but I don't believe it was aged/seasoned like other higher end sushi restaurants. If you're going to just get sashimi or nigiri, you are probably better off going to a fish market and getting sashimi grade fish there yourself. Overall, presentation of the food was good and creative, and the Maki's are worth getting at the very least. On the other hand the quality and value for the entrees seem to be lacking. Lunch specials on the weekdays are still of good value so that's definitely worth trying!",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1613,4,"Oishii means delicious in Japanese. The food was very much ""oishii"" here. The ambience is beautiful too- there is a small pond in the middle of the room.We started off with some sake. We also ordered salmon that was hanging off a small rack- they lit it on fire. You must order this! It cooks your salmon slightly, and is covered in delicious sauce. We also had the beef tartarte, which came with a shell like thing on top, and a raw egg. It looked like a work of art. I didn't want to destroy it but since I paid for it, I devoured it.We also ordered a few sushi rolls and the seafood risotto. The risotto came in a hot pot, it was ok... it was a bit more like claypot rice to me. We wanted to order toro but I think they were out, so we ordered scallops instead. Our waiter was excellent, he made very good recommendations.This place is great, you should come here to celebrate a special occasion or to simply indulge in Japanese food.",Oishii Boston,"1166 Washington St Boston, MA 02118"1614,4,"Came here on a Saturday night and Oishii managed to fill me in a last minute reservation. Sashimi/sushi was super fresh and easy to understand. You can either get chef's choice or they'll give you a pen where you mark whichever you want. Their squid ink was exceptional. Golden flakes decorated on the top with super tender calamaris. Ugh, I could just have a dream about it tonight. Also had the seafood risotto and to be honest, I could skip that but the scallops were cooked to perfection. Downfall-- they give you an appetizer as soon as you sit down and it was edamame purÃ©e but no one seemed to explain to me what it was (could've died if I were actually allergic to it, but thank goodness I wasn't.)

I dined at lunch, right at opening. It was seat yourself and I was able to pick a booth near an open window. The service was quick and very considerate. The clam chowder was very good. It was nice and creamy. I also had the chicken tenders which were properly crispy. They would be a great choice for picky, younger kids. The onion rings were excellent! Probably my favorite thing I ate today and the best onion rings I've had in a very long time!! Usually the onions inside are a weird texture or completely pulled out when you eat them but I totally did NOT experience that with these! The combo platter was tasty as well.

Very very noisy when we stepped in and gradually the noise died down. Ordered the Fish Sandwich, and the Ted Kennedy burger. They both were just about average. We also ordered Clam Chowder. It was the best Chowder we had tasted. Lots of clam bits, and you could smell the ocean in it. We later had Clam Chowder at many places during our trip including the Cape and Mr Dooley's had the best.",Mr. Dooley's,"77 Broad St Boston, MA 02109"1628,3,"Did you know that a quality pint of Guinness depends on how it's stored? Apparently, Dooley's has one of the best pints in the city. I was here just meeting up with some friends for a beer after work on a Wednesday and didn't get anything besides the beer, hence the three stars. It looks like they have live music most every evening and the decor is what you picture an Irish pub to be. Wood finishing and an extensive selection of Irish whiskey.

Menu is helpful to people who are not familiar with Japanese tapas. They provide pictures of most food on the menu. They also give a lot of food options, way more comparing to an average Japanese restaurant. Food quality? It is good enough that you want to compare it with a izakaya in Japan. It is authentic. Some food options are better than others, but considering the wide varieties they provide, you can't complain when they overlook the egg or add too much soy sauce in the noodle. I mean, when you are considering food options in the States, you would go for a restaurant for its steak, go for another one for its seafood. Same in other countries. Back in Japan, I will go to one place for Hakata Ramen, go for another place for Sapporo Ramen, another place for sushi... This place is like Applebee's, offering you a bunch of options, but you can always find something better.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1637,4,A fan of their whole eel dish as it costs the similar to other restaurants (other restaurants will have smaller piece of eel and add rice). Â Mentaiko was good but expensive. Â Okonomiyaki was alright but still trying to find a legit Hiroshima style version where they layer the ingredients. I wish they opened for lunch!!!,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1638,3,"Very authentic Japanese food! Keep in mind that the place is more tapas style so best to order a few things to satisfy your hunger. When my friends and I came here, we got the following: -Okonomiyaka: okay, but too salty for my liking -Chefs combo: the meats we got were chicken, beef and pork belly. Thought the chicken was the best, while the beef was wayyy too hard. -Mentaiko pasta special (cod fish roe pasta): one of their most popular dishes. Really good!! -Tokoyaki: yum, super flavorful. Fav of the night~-Quail eggs wrapped in bacon: good! Overall, it was a good time. There were some very minor flaws with some of the dishes, but the food that we did like were really good. Would come back to try out the other dishes!! Their menu is very extensive so you're sure to find something you like. And the best part is everything is very affordable. Definitely a place worth checking out!!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1639,5,"This restaurant is hands down my go-to when I am craving for Japanese food but not your typical sushi/tempura food. My favorite items on their menu is their cod roe fish pasta, omusoba, and steak don! There are so many items that I have enjoyed and still a lot that I have not yet tried.Sashimi - Tastes really fresh and I love that they offer a lot of different combinations and styles of preparing itAburi Salmon No Oshizushi - Wow this roll itself does not even need soy sauce because it is already seasoned; the proportions of the rice and fish is surprisingly really goodAssorted kushiyaki - I would say that these are my least favorite because when I had it, it was really really dry and super hard to get it off the sticksOmusoba - The egg is super soft with the perfect amount of seasoning on top which wraps some flavorful noodles underneath. This is honestly one of the best combinations ever and crave for this all the time!Steak Don - Perfect amount of steak that is cooked perfectly and seasoned well over a bed of rice. Love how no other restaurants offer this. Honestly this reminds me of a dish that my mom always makes so this hits the spot for me Katsu Don - Pork was cooked really well and the egg was super soft; this is quite a usual dish I find at every restaurant so I would choose more unique dishes if you want to try something new; still worth it to order though!Beef Sushi - This was something different that I've never tried before so this was a pleasure to eat - the meat was cooked medium/medium rare and it just melted in my mouth along with the riceBeef Tongue w/ scallions - Highly recommend ordering this; it was so addicting to eat because I love how they seasoned it and they give you a lot of scallions which pairs very well with it! Not a fan of eating a lot of scallion at once, but I wrapped the beef around it and it was REALLY goodTakoyaki - One of the better takoyaki in Boston; perfectly crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the in side. Love how big they are too!Waffles a la Mode - The flan was the best part because the waffle was too dense and not the texture you find in a typical Belgium waffle; this comes with ice cream as well with your choice of vanilla, red bean, or green teaSesame Pudding - I am in love with anything sesame; at first I thought it was pretty bland with some mild sesame flavor, but I later discovered that you get more flavor when you scrape the sides :D love this dessert now hahaOn top of the great food and service, they have valet parking too! This is perfect because I am terrible at parallel parking....let alone finding parking in Boston!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1640,4,"Came here on a Saturday evening and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the restaurant considering how many reviews I've read referring to this place as a ""hole-in-the-wall"", ""crowded"", and ""busy"". Luckily my friend and I were eating dinner around 5:30pm so it was not too crowded and we got seated immediately.I split an Omusoba with my friend (we got it because it seems to be a popular item to order) and I got a spicy miso ramen as well. The omusoba was well presented and fairly delicious with its balance of saltiness from the Yakisoba sauce and creaminess from the mayo and egg. It definitely reminds me of the okonomiyaki I had in Osaka though it was probably a bit on the lighter side with the Yakisoba and mayo sauces (not necessarily a bad thing since I find that those sauces sometimes make the dish heavier than I would like). The spicy miso ramen had a nice flavorful broth (menu says it's a chicken-tonkotsu base). One quip that I sometimes have with ramen is that the broth is room-temperature or just not warm enough, and this ramen definitely did not suffer from this problem. I definitely enjoyed drinking the broth. The one other notable thing about this ramen was that for meat they used pork innards instead of chashu. The texture and flavor of the innards was interesting at first, but I probably would have just preferred chashu. Besides the meat, there were some peppers, bean sprouts, and of course ramen noodles (RIP no soft boiled egg =/).All in all, the meal was solid and the service was good. I don't know if I would order the same dishes again, but I am definitely looking forward to coming back to Ittoku to try out their yakitori and other small dishes.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1641,4,They should turn on the AC during the summer time. Their food is good but the place is too hot and humid to truly enjoy everything.,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1642,4,"Great customer service, great quality food, somewhat pricey ($86 pretax for a *light*meal for 4).

Absolutely love trying new dishes as well as returning to my favorites! Mentaiko pasta is mouthwatrring good! Not super fishy tasting and well balanced between the cheese and salmon. So good! The one downfall of ittoku is the wait times! They do not they reservations on fridays and Saturdays so beating the crowd is always hard to do. If you linger by the bar you can catch a shorter wait time.,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1644,5,"Keep it simple!$4 beer +5pcs of yakitori (chef's choice) = decent after work meal under $10... well, yeah maybe tack on $2 for tip if you feel like it.Like I said, ""keep it simple!"" just sayin'",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1645,4,"I've been here a few times. The first couple times, I was not too impressed but it wasn't terrible. I just felt like I wasn't ordering the right things. I remember going for different rolls/sushi and yakitori. They put a lot of rice on their rolls, which I'm not a big fan of. The yakitori selection is very good, but I think some of them could be too salty so beware. By my 3rd time, I went with a couple friends who had traveled to Japan pretty frequently so I trusted them a bit more on what to order. We ordered quite a few things to share but the items that really stood out was Ika Yaki (broiled squid), Omusoba (yakisoba noodles in an egg omlette), and for dessert, the Belgian waffle with flan and ice cream. The squid was chewy and perfectly seasoned - I LOVED IT. The Omusoba was full of so much flavor. I wished it was a bigger size to be honest! As for the Belgian waffle with flan and ice cream, it was such a nice balance to the rest of the meal. The waffle was warm and slightly chewy. The flan was the right amount of sweet. We opted for green tea ice cream, which complemented the whole thing. The only thing that I don't like is that there is usually a wait whenever I have gone. Granted, that must mean they are doing something right! Harry's is just down the street so I suggest waiting and getting a drink there if you're with your friends. Overall, this is one of my favorite places in Allston. Highly recommend for adventurous eaters!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1646,4,Cheap and casual style Japanese restaurant.

We came here for dinner and drinks and spent wya less than anticipated. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, of which my favorite were the carpaccio, 5 kinds sashimi, tuna tartare, and beef tongue.

I will definitely be back!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1648,5,"My FAVORITE Japanese place in Boston. This place is so good and pretty close to authentic. The food is so flavorful and delicious! The service is good with nice servers and hot food even when it's busy. I HIGHLY recommend eating here, but make a reservation (esp. on the weekends!). It's street parking, which makes it hard to find a spot, but it's absolutely worth it!!",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1649,5,"This is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Boston. Near impossible to find parking so their valet park for $5.00 may be the way to go if you don't want to take public transportation. It has the best Yakitori in Boston. Beer and Yakitori and their other small plates is the way to go. Sushi is good also. This is a great place to meet up friends. It has Â great food, great atmosphere, and great service. I have been here multiple times and always had great service. Always. The great thing about this restaurant is the picture menu. You know exactly what you're ordering. Our favorite is the chicken skin, chicken meatball, the chicken thigh, chicken gizzards, chicken heart, basically almost everything on the menu. The beef ones are also very good. Even the grilled rice is good. You really have to try everything. If you're adventurous, try the fatty beef tongue as it is one of my husband's favorite. If you're thinking you'd be French kissing a cow, I would steer clear. Also the cuts of bacon and sausages goes well with a cold beer. Items to share would be the okonomiyaki. Basically a crispy pancake. I would share the creamy pasta since it's only good in small portion. It gets heavy after the first few bites. Very standard but also good hamachi kama, broiled yellowtail collar. The adashi tofu is good also. The sushi selection is pretty good for the price. I recommend ordering the carpaccio. You get thinly sliced sashimi over a bed of greens. It has a light vinaigrette dressing. I also recommend the sashimi. The cuts are thick. We have tried the salmon, yellowtail, and tuna. All are very good quality. The mackerel sashimi is also very good but has a stronger fish taste. The botan ebi is very fresh. The sea conch sushi has a a crunchy texture but is very fresh. A good maki to try is the fatty tuna maki with scallion. The takowasa or wasabi and fresh chopped octopus is very good. It is slimy because of the fresh octopus so this is not a dish for everyone. I do not recommend the takoyaki. It is very dry. The steamed monkfish liver sushi was only okay. I have had better at other sushi restaurants. It's not creamy here but rather grainy. See my pictures.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1650,5,"Holy shit this place was so good, and I feel like everything I have to say is just reiterating what everybody else is saying. I went with a group of 7 at around 8 on a Saturday night and it took us about 50 minutes to be seated. They don't take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays, so it's kind of expected that it'll take long. Luckily it took most of those 50 minutes for all 7 of us to get there so it didn't end up feeling like much of wait. The staff was all extremely friendly and very helpful. Most of food was all amazing and at its worst couple of things were decent. Â Toro Toro Gyutan (meltingly delicious beef tongue)- the menu description is on point. It was ridiculously tender and juicy, probably the best beef tongue I've ever had in my life. Next time I go, I just want to order 3 plates of this. Â Chewy Fresh Cod Roe Pasta - Sooo good. The noodles were chewy and the sauce was thick and satisfying. The cod roe just adds a little saltiness and umami to what would've already been a delicious pasta dish. It actually made me sad how Japanese culture took a Western dish and did their best to improve it by adding their influence, meanwhile in America we're like hey let's take this sushi....and put it in a burrito. Omusoba - So satisfying to cut into. The egg is a little thinner than I would expect but the eggs and the sauces mix together with the yakisoba to create a hearty and satisfying dish. Tori Karage - It was good, the chicken wasn't dry but I thought the outside could've been a little crispier. I'm curious how it compares to the other fried chicken dishes but all in all, it was still pretty good. It comes with some mayo, some kind of sauce that seemed in between a ketchup and hot sauce, and some cumin. We also got the 10 piece yakitori combo. I thought it would be a good idea to get a bunch since there were so many of us and we could save a little money. It was all good but we got more gizzard and some other kind of intestine (liver?) than I'd like. I really wanted to try the thigh and short-rib and it didn't end up coming with the combo. I think you'd be better off just individually ordering the things you want. This + a few other dishes I didn't get a chance to try + a couple pitchers of Sapporo = one of the best dining experiences I had in a long time.",Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1651,3,"This is probably one of the more local, affordable izakaya places in boston.

There is a diverse selection of foods from your traditional izakaya eats like yakitori, to sushi, and hotter meals like ramen and rice bowls. On top of that there is a large selection of sake. I prefer my sake dry and full bodied :) Kudos to the taste profile chart. It makes ordering sake easier. If you're unsure, ask for a sample.

I always get the skewers and I'm never disappointed. I also love ordering their sushi because they don't skimp out on fish and the fish they use is fresh! Cod roe pasta was light and chewy. I definitely recommend getting this! The omusoba was a bit too oily for me and could have been skipped! The okonomiyaki was flavorful and was packed with meat and a lot of cabbage.I've ordered the Aburi Salmon Oshizushi a couple of times and it was great! I didn't expect it to be spicy.Parking is hard around the area but they do offer $5 valet parking.,Ittoku,"1414 Commonwealth Ave Boston, MA 02135"1655,5,"On our quick trip to Boston we found this via Yelp. I've rated other things five stars but this place needs 11 stars!!!! Culinary delight doesn't even cut it!!!The place is small- we had a hard time finding seating because it was so popular, and we sat at a long table. Some people sat next to us and a woman right next to us at our table kept looking at us hard every time we talked, so you may not get your own table if you care about that. I will say that the food is a must try! I had a grains and greens bowl. It wasn't as good as Cava but it was good. The rest of our order was AMAZING, however.My son got a lamb sandwich, other son got a grilled cheese panini style sandwich, we got a raspberry muffin which is to die for! It is not too sweet which makes it incredible. Go there now!",Flour Bakery + Café,"12 Farnsworth St Boston, MA 02210"1656,4,"Good place for some fresh baked goodies as well as salads and sandwiches.

The rasperry spritzer was also super refreshing especially because we were there during a heatwave.Was super sad I didnt get to try their boston cream pie though.. they didnt have it until our last visit but unfortunately I was way too stuffed to get it then.",Flour Bakery + Café,"12 Farnsworth St Boston, MA 02210"1658,5,"Good, fresh, healthy food served quick.I had the spicy tuna bowl, it wasn't spicy, just the best damn salad for these hot days.

The combination with the sticky buns was memorable.",Flour Bakery + Café,"12 Farnsworth St Boston, MA 02210"1659,5,"Everyone had been telling me to try this bakery when I visited, so I had to stop in before I left. There were so many options, I didn't know how to choose. But the one thing I knew I had to try was the sticky bun....wow that sticky bun was good. It would have been better served warm but it was hood either way! The coffee was also a good choice too.The menu was so expansive, I think you would have to check in to this place a few days a week to try everything. Plus the staff was so sweet and helpful.",Flour Bakery + Café,"12 Farnsworth St Boston, MA 02210"1660,4,"Flour CafÃ© has expanded to many corners of Boston, but this is the location I've visited most.Despite the ever creeping expansion of the brand, Flour has retained its quality overall. On my most recent visit I got some of my favorites for an in-depth review. Here are my thoughts.Oreo cookie-sweet and creamy inside. Cookie is soft, cocoa flavor. Not crispy. Fresh made buttercream filling is much superior to that of a store-bought Oreo. Soft, creamy, and very sweet. I also appreciate that the filling doesn't stiff up like concrete to the cookie, but rather has a buttery consistency. The cookie itself is on the softer side, which would be my only complaint as I would like a little more crunch when I bite into the cookie. But it's perfect for those who prefer a softer style cookie. Banana bread has a soft and spongey texture. I think the bread used to be denser and heavier. Otherwise it is moist, sweet and has a ripe banana flavor. Walnuts are nice. Crust has a deeper molasses complexity. Carrot cake has a cream cheese frosting reminiscent of NYC style cheesecake, with a sour cream tang. Raisins, a hint of coconut and shredded carrots in tandem with cinnamon and nutmeg create a satisfying depth of flavor. The Boston cream cake is a layered version of the dessert. Several layers of whipped cream and cake. The whipped cream filling is a different experience than a traditional custard filling. Very creamy, but not as heavy. The whipped cream also delivers a little more flavor than a custard filling. Also seemed like the cake has been soaked in a coffee liqueur/syrup. Not a perfect Boston cream, but it is an interesting take on the dessert. Flour remains a solid recommendation.",Flour Bakery + Café,"12 Farnsworth St Boston, MA 02210"1661,4,"Stopped here while traveling before heading to the airport. Loved the atmosphere and paper marbling art on the walls. A colorful cafe with a fun personality! I got the breakfast egg and ham sandwich on gluten free bread. Normally I expect a smaller sandwich, but their gluten free bread is huge! It was very filling and the sauce on it (some kind of dijon) was really tasty. I ordered a green tea with it and noticed they make their own loose leaf bags. Very cool. Also took an iced almond milk chai and gf/vegan almond macaron to go. Yum! The girl on POS remembered my name when I walked up to place my to-go order. Love that! Would have given five stars but my green tea was only poured like 3/4 full. Understandable at an establishment that gets so busy, but still not ideal. Definitely plan to get something sweet if you come here.

(I've waited multiple times on line at Dominique Ansel Bakery, the Cronut is king) Walking into Flour Bakery + CafÃ©, its total madness. There are people everywhere, there are no lines, no signs and more importantly, no Sticky Buns. It's noon and I ask the counter person, I don't see any Sticky Buns, do you have any in the back? Nope, we ran out earlier today. What??? The counter person noticed I was bummed so he directed me to the bread pudding with the sticky bun topping. Alright..

Luckly Flour Bakery showed and had top ratings for the area. I stopped at night and it wasnt busy at the time so I was able to look around and see what they had to offer. I got the sticky bun everyone raved about and a raspberry bar. The raspberry bar was fresh and I couldnt resist myself from eating it by the time I left out the door. It was still warm and delicious it made my night to have this treat. The next morning I warmed up my sticky bun and was the perfect way to start my day. The bun soaked all the flavors in and was not overly sweet but just right.

It is specifically known for its sticky buns. The pecans and sauce on top of the bun were incredible and gave the ""Wow"" factor. The brioche bun was also delicious. They were like donuts. I was also at the bakery near the end of the day when they only had a sticky bun bread pudding. The pudding was good but it is not for everyone. Since it is pudding, it can get a little soggy at the end of the day. As such, it is why the regular sticky bun, with the brioche bread, is the top seller. Nevertheless, the bread pudding version still has the caramelized pecans on top, which is the best part of the sticky buns.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

I looked behind me and there was a table of 6 and 5/6 of the guests at the table had ordered the mushroom ravioli as well - they basically licked their plates clean. The ravioli is light and the sauce is heavenly. My boyfriend got the chicken parm and was extremely satisfied as well.The restaurant is fairly cozy, like most restaurants in the North End. We sat at the bar and the bar service wasn't super speedy; however, the food came out decently quick. They don't have the best bread, but leaves more room for the food.

Thin cut veal in a rich mushroom and marsala sauce. Easy to cut with just the side of a knife, Yum. On the side, a fresh store-made fusilli pasta.

My friends always recommended Nico and it took The Boy and I entirely too long to finally make it happen.

First of all it's a hefty ball - we split it between a party of 4 and there's plenty to go around, but it's so tasty I'll say you'll want to only split it between 2.For my entree, I ordered one of the special's of the night: The Cioppino and if you ever get the chance, don't pass on this dish! It was served in a large metal bowl and filled to the brim with an assortment of seafood (peep that photo). So full of seafood in fact, I barely made a dent in it to reach the pasta at the bottom. To get an idea of how good this dish was, people walking in and waiting for their table continued to peek at our table and you could hear them asking 'What did she get? That looks good' and good it was.The Boy got the Rigatoni con Carciofi e Salsiccia. I was so overwhelmed and enthralled with my own dish, I didn't try a bite of his as I usually do. However, I have no doubt it was equally as amazing. The homemade rigatoni looked divine and lets just put it at The Boy didn't take home any leftovers.I highly recommend making a reservation by the way.

We loved the speakeasy feel of the place, and the rotating chefs creating menus from all of over the world makes this a unique place to visit that can't ever become boring. What I think is so special about this South End Speakeasy is that they showcase up-and-coming chefs, giving them a place to be creative.Our menu was created by Humaari which had a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern vibe. We originally had a reservation for 6, in which case, for a set price, the chef will prepare dishes to share specially for your group. Sadly, 4 our crew's flights were cancelled, so it was just my husband and me. Our server recommended ordering several to share plates, so we started with the Grilled Black Mission Figs. A perfect size for sharing, this delicious dish was definitely our favorite. We also shared the Marinated Summer Vegetables hummus- I HIGHLY recommend this. It was so fresh, we were licking the plate clean. They will replace your pita, too, if you run out. The Chickpea Crepes were next. The dish, served with baba ganoush, red onion, ramp pesto and maras, was tasty, extremely savory. I thought this would be my favorite, but it probably ranked number four for me. This might be because it got forgotten and we didn't get it until we were tired, full, and ready to leave. There were other options that included meats, but we find we love to eat vegetarian when it comes to Mediterranean meals. My husband had the Ghost Hunter cocktail which he loved. I started with the Persian Summer, which reads like a dark and stormy, but is extremely sweet. I followed it with the Into the Wild, which was polar opposite: earthy and savory. I preferred the latter with our meal.Our service was extremely slow. The tables to our left and right turned over twice before we were able to leave, and we were not eating slowly or trying to stay up all night. Be prepared to be patient.

This place is awesome for a boys night out or a date/night out in town.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"1700,4,"Wink & Nod operates a rotating kitchen every 6 months. This month, they were serving Spanish food. I love Spanish food so I decided to come.*Finding the restaurant*Finding the restaurant can be a little challenging. When it gets later at night, there is a bouncer outside. If you are just going for drinks late at night, look for the bouncer.*Seating tips*There are 2 different sections for seats. One is downstairs right next to the bar. That is where we sat, and it got pretty loud. There were groups of people standing around the bar, and some were really near the tables, so it will be loud. There is also another seating area in what looked like the mezzanine area, away from the bar. I would recommend sitting there if you don't want to have to shout.*The drinks*The cocktail menu is excellent here. They even had a winter special which was a egg nog with a layer of Bacardi 151 on top. They would set the 151 on fire in front of you, which was cool.*The food*-Spanish cheeses: these came with grilled bread which was excellent. I thought that it was a little weird that nobody explained what kind of cheese we were being served. The menu simply said assorted cheeses, and the person who served us the cheese dropped it off and walked away. Luckily the cheese was delicious.-Fried calamari: this was the bomb. The calamari pieces were lightly fried, with delicious sauce.-Paella: this was a disappointment. It was more like claypot rice with seafood on top. IT wasn't even served in a paella pan, it seemed to have been cooked in a claypot and even had the burnt edges of claypot rice. Maybe it was more ""creative""? But that was not paella to me.-Emapnadas: These came with some sort of jelly, which I did not really like. I just ate the empanadas. They were good but small. I've had better empanadas, sorry.Overall, this is a cool restaurant to visit. Make sure to check out the rotating chefs to know what kind of cuisine is cooking in the kitchen.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"1701,5,"My fiancÃ© and I are sitting here at the bar at Wink & Nod just reveling in a singular experience. We walked in at 10pm on a Monday night and the place was pretty dead. Not surprising. We asked if they were still serving food and they said that they had just shut down their grill and oven, so no luck. Again, understandable and unsurprising. But this is where things went off the rails in an amazing way. Julian, our bartender, and Louie (who we would later learn is their head chef) started going through options of places in the area that would be still serving food and giving their favorites dishes at each. Then, after I mentioned that my fiancÃ© was really looking for vegetables, Louie pulled out their menu and started trying to figure out what he could do for us. They settled on a vegetable hummus plate and Louie set of to make it just for us. In the meantime, Julian proceeded to make me a special smoked Old Fashioned (by Laura's request). When the hummus plate arrived, it was delectable, as were our drinks. What a treat! These guys could have simply turned us away. It would have been perfectly acceptable. Instead, they went out of there way to try to help us any way they could - even if that had meant sending us someplace else. They are a total class act.

We had a great dinner there last week. Actually the best kind of dinner, which is ""order one of everything on the menu."" We did just that (and two of some things!) for our group of eight. After a few strike outs, we were delighted to find that Wink and Nod could accommodate our large group for a walk-in on Weds night. The ambiance was cool and dim, quiet enough to hear each other but not awkwardly empty. (We noticed a lot of swipe right situations around us, seems like a good place for a second or third date on a weeknight.)We were celebrating with a gluten-free gal, so you can imagine our delight when we learned that EVERYTHING on the menu was gluten free - even the calamari, made with tapioca batter! (As one of the fortunate gluten-tolerant folks, I can assure you that nothing was weird and I wouldn't have noticed it was gluten free.) Highlights for us were probably the cauliflower gratin and the chicken (though we were disappointed by the chicken's serving size, one leg for $28). We also loved the mushrooms and the brussel sprouts. The flank steak and other dishes I'm failing to remember were all fine. The only dish that wasn't scraped clean was a frisee-heavy salad. Everything was exceptionally flavorful and I would certainly return if the same group was going to be in the kitchen.My only word of caution, I'd stick to wine (or whisky!), as my last review from ~four years ago seems to still be accurate re: cocktails. The ones my friends had were all made with great intentions, but often fell a little flat and some were just too sweet.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"1704,2,"Cool atmosphere, but disappointing everything else. Wink & Nod looks like a lot of other speakeasy themed bars in Boston. Partially below ground, dark-moody lighting, full bar at the center. The cocktails I tried were not very enjoyable, especially for $15. Not sure if it was an issue with execution or the recipe, but I definitely wouldn't order what I tried again. As an example, La Paloma was an over complicated an inferior version of a straightforward cocktail. It just didn't taste good. Serving it with a full-sized straw on a red wine glass was odd.The pop-up kitchen idea is interesting. Â The beef hummus plate tasted fine, but for a dish clearly meant to be shared, serving it with just two pieces of bread is bizarre. What was most disappointing about my visit though was the service. The wait staff was mostly friendly and efficient, but the restaurant must have some strange rules that I don't quite understand. I was with a group in one of the areas with couches and standing space. I went to the bar to ask for some water. The bar and the restaurant was mostly empty, and yet got some surprising sass from the bartender about how I should only order through the wait staff. Maybe you can't just walk up to the bar and order stuff from the bar in a bar . I don't know. Also, even though I originally came with a group, I was interested in getting a separate table for dinner. Asked the staff, apparently all the tables were reserved. I was in the bar for 3 hours or so and the restaurant remained 80% empty the whole time. Again, I don't know, maybe only some tables are actually open for dinner. Wasn't offered a spot at the bar or anything. Overall, Wink & Nod may cool, but I don't think the price, service, and food are worth it. Conveniently, many other spots in the city look almost exactly the same and offer a better experience.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"1705,2,We came here on a Saturday night for drinks and the experience wasn't too great.

But, it's worth it when you descend into the dark, speakeasy vibe. Really cool atmosphere and a bar I'd be happy to hang out in. We were there for dinner so we ended up in a corner table in the elevated section above the bar. Very cozy and quiet. Love the pop up kitchen concept. The theme of the kitchen for our visit was Spanish tapas. Started with drinks. Three of us ordered the Heat Mizer. Vida Mezcal, Orgeat, Lemon, Mole Bitters, Ginger Beer and a Seared Padron Pepper. I say ""a"" pepper because they put a whole pepper in the drink. Awesome garnish and tasty too! The overall balance of smokey and spicy was perfect. The Malbec and Tempranillo were good as well. For small plates, we tried the Truffle Pave, Fall Gourds and Roasted Mushrooms. All 3 were excellent. Servings were decent, but definitely tapas-small (ish). The Pave was exceptional. Great flavor and texture. Highly recommend it. Mushrooms sounded great and were good...but not as great as I'd hoped. For a medium plate, we got the special for the evening and damned if I can remember what it was now 24 hours later. No reflection on the quality, total reflection on my poor memory. Or possibly a reflection of my significant mescal intake over the course of the evening. Large plate was the Ribeye. Very well cooked. Tasty, but for $36 I thought there might be a bit more of it. We got the almond cake and chocolate torte and both were good. Service was very good and all in all, while expensive, I'd go back next time we're in town. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"1709,2,"The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the excellent service (our waitress was so sweet). Otherwise the food was bad and the drinks sub-par. We were seated in an corner of the restaurant where there really shouldn't have been a table. It was right next to the kitchen with waiters constantly going in and out. Who would want a $50+ per person dinner seated next to the kitchen?? For food, We got the chickpea frites (which were honestly very very good) and it just went downhill from there. We got the cauliflower hummus which had such sour lemoney cauliflower it ruined the dish. I usually love cauliflower but it was done very badly in the hummus; the pita was very fresh and good though. We then got the lamb shank- HORRIBLE. for a $32 dish, I expect some flavor and well cooked meat. Really really really bad. I hate to be explicit- but I vomited at home for 30 minutes because of this food. There must have been something wrong because that does not happen often to me. For drinks, I don't remember what they were called, but they were too strong with little flavor other than alcohol. All photos attached!

Hopefully they seat us in a better area.",Wink & Nod,"3 Appleton St Boston, MA 02116"1710,3,"I like the restaurants concept but it seems faulty. This would be my second time trying this place out and the food is always just okay. Although I will say the cocktails and ambiance are on point. Â  This last time we went they had a Spanish/Portuguese chef in which we ordered the pomegranate brussel sprouts, squid in squid ink, olives, and the cheese plate. Brussels sprouts and olives were okay but the squid was more so fried vegetables in squid ink and the cheese plate was the saddest cheese plate one may ever come across. The cheeses were not well kept, but the presentation was a disaster - cheses were merely thrown on a plate with a hand full of cashews.

I. Love. Indonesian. Food. They asked if we had a reservation and we didn't but we were seated right away and there were a lot of open spots. The space is quite lovely, with comfy booths and cute nooks for a great first date, but we were seated near the bar where it was very loud.

They were each some of the best tasting we've ever had. The pork belly was so tender that it falls apart in your mouth. The Brussels sprouts were glazed and flavored so well that it was a delicacy. Nice showcasing of molecular gastronomy too. Chef himself greeted us and chatted more about his story and concept. Truly personalized.

Their menu is impressively extensive--with some creative and crazy combinations that will leave you wishing that you had enough stomach space to eat all the burgers you want instead of having to make the hard choice of choosing only one. My friend and I were so intrigued by some of the combinations that I can't count the number of times we asked out loud ""do those ingredients work well together?!""

We ordered a cider and a beer on tap. It was all good and fun until the bartender went to pour another beer and the tap exploded on my boyfriend, me and the woman next to me. The bartender did not apologize, but just handed us napkins. A bit odd, but we were seated for food shortly after. We ordered an All American burger ($12) and a Frappe ($9) to split (One of the previous monthly flavors so I'm not sure the name - It had churros and a choco taco inside!). They have some crazy burgers on the menu, but we wanted to keep it somewhat simple (bacon, bbq sauce, blue cheese, cheese, lettuce, tomato).

There was nearly too much on this burger to be able to get it in my mouth. If I had it to do over, I would definitely get a side of the fried Mac and cheese because some of that fell off my burger and it was delicious by itself.

Each burger will come with sides. I believe your choices were extra potato chips, beans, or cole slaw. We came with a party of 14 or so on a Wednesday lunch. Luckily we beat the lunch rush and the hostess was able to set up our party in the back of the restaurant. I ordered the Waikiki Beach Burger. A hamburger with grilled pineapple (YAS), ham, bacon (oh baby), and covered in teriyaki sauce. I have to admit that the ham made the burger a little more salty than I would've preferred but it does bring in the salty flavor profile. My friends ordered The Artery Clogger, The 420 Burger, and The Rundown. All of the burgers looked great! Definitely went for a long walk after our meal. Just to top it off, we ordered a #FreakFrappe to share. Again.. the creativity is off the wall here! We decided on the S'more than you can handle. (see photo). It was a delicious ending to a delicious meal. Oh and they serve beer. Gotta get that beer!!",Boston Burger Company - Boston,"1100 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"1734,5,"Came here last night for the first time with my husband and a friend. I got the Mac attack burger and they both got the hot mess burger. Everything was super delicious, oh my goodness.

Can't wait to be back",Boston Burger Company - Boston,"1100 Boylston St Boston, MA 02215"1735,4,"I recently moved to Boston, so after a morning of seeing the city, I was famished and looking for a good place to grab a quick lunch. I found this spot, and blindly entered without reading any reviews. Since it's located in the touristy area of the city (and it was lunch hour), the restaurant was pretty busy when I came in, so I had to wait a few minutes in a really tight area to get a table (which I didn't really mind).Nonetheless, I must say I lucked out, since the food and service was fabulous, and fairly priced. I ordered the salmon and feta toast, which I highly recommend. Will definitely come back.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"1736,3,"Brunch wasn't bad. Toast was a little on the burnt side, eggs were left a little too long on the flattop, potatoes had obviously been cooked an hour or two before.Tasted alright and the price point wasn't bad - would have been better if care had been taken during the cooking process.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"1737,3,"I typically enjoy eating here. In fact, I enjoyed 50% of my meal here this past weekend. The Cauliflower appetizer was amazing and I would have had that 3 times over if I had know my entree was going to be so disappointing. I had been craving ramen for awhile, so I was pleasantly surprised that they had a Ramen Bowl on the menu. I suppose I should have been suspicious of a place that isn't not known for their Ramen dishes, but I have never been disappointed in their food before, so I chanced it. Too bad my chance didn't pan out. So this is more of a warning not to get this specific dish...When ordering a Ramen bowl, one would expect to eat Ramen noodles. At the Granary Tavern you will find yourself eating a giant bowl of spaghetti. Actual spaghetti. The texture threw me off from the start. The pork in the bowl was decent, but the rest of the ingredients were subpar. And to make matters worse, the broth, the part I love the most, was a let down too. I gave this review 3 stars because half of my meal was delicious. But it's always disappointing to end a meal on a not so great entree. I will still go back to this place, but I won't be getting this meal again.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"1738,3,"We made a reservation & had a decent meal. Â Honestly, it was nothing special. Â My burger was $16 and the patty was right off the Sysco truck. Â The roll and cheese were good but overall it wasn't anything special. Â The fries were odd because almost all the pieces were less than an inch long. Â My wife's tagine was good but by the end of it, she was really getting tired of the spice.The atmosphere is nice and we sat in the basement. Â It's a bit quieter and you can really see the amazing construction of the old building. Â The server was nice enough and got the order right, but she sort of forgot about us at the end of the meal. Â The restaurant is generally clean though the table really should have been wiped down before they seated us.I have a hard time thinking of the Granary Tavern as anything more than okay and that's worth three stars.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"1739,2,"Absolutely everything about this place was average. Â I dropped it two stars because the service was below average and because they charged $4 for a cup of black coffee. Â They don't have the drink prices on the menu and then they slap you with a $4 fee for one cup of joe. Â I don't know why anyone would come here when if you're already going downtown, there are so many better options. Â I could make myself the same food at home for a quarter of the price.

We're in Boston for the first time this weekend and decided to check out this place before catching a trolley tour. Our order came out about 10 minutes after we ordered.

The atmosphere was indeed lovely, and the meal overall was delicious. However, I was surprised by the quality of service. We did not have silverware on our table, and when I went inside to ask, a woman yelled at me and told me to wait.

Â Cooking execution was lacking extremely.,Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"1745,4,"I came here on NYE for my birthday and there wasn't much of a crowd. The staff was very kind and courteous. I didn't say anything about an occasion because I wasn't sure if anyone was going to sing anything. I liked the atmosphere as well. They also had coat racks for hanging jackets which is neat and it was free standing and in a hallway so not hanging over anyone's head.They had a special menu for NYE that involved a lot of lobster but I opted not to get it because I didn't think I'd be able to finish everything. I got the scallops and bacon risotto and boyfriend got the open faced chicken sandwich. My dish was a lot smaller than I expected. It was 6 scallops surrounding a chunk of rice. I got a little confused because I couldn't find any bacon but then realized it was seared onto the scallops. It tasted great to me. The risotto itself could've used more flavor but it was delicious. I loved the sauce too and just wish there was more. I think the price was decent but at the end of the meal, I just wasn't really full. Ordered dessert afterwards and got some sort of lemon-y dessert if I remember correctly. Great and sweet but after eating half of it, it was just too strong, ended up having to leave it there. I think I'd come back to try other dishes here.",Granary Tavern,"170 Milk St Boston, MA 02109"1746,4,"I've been here multiple times now and and every time I've consistently enjoyed the experience and the food. Â It's usually pretty easy to get a table since the restaurant is very large with tons of seating but they also take reservations.The restaurant has a nice, rustic ambiance and in the summer you can enjoy eating on the patio. Â There's a mixture of high tables, low tables and booths. Â It's a little weird because there are two entrances but IMO the back of the restaurant looks like the front from the outside so when you walk in, you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the hostess stand. Â Brunch here has been consistently good. Â I've ordered the eggs Benedict on multiple occasions and have been very happy with my meal. Â They have a Bellini bar for $30 that comes with 3 different types of juice mixtures. Â It's been different every time but all have been good! Â I've also had the French toast and everyone at the table raved over how amazing good they were.Dinner here is also good and there are a few more unique options than just your typical tavern type food.

Once seated we were promptly greet with waters. We placed our children's order immediately, which came out fast. Overall the food was out quickly but lacked flavor.

Â I don't ask for much, maybe a side hot sauce that isn't Tabasco, an occasional swapped side. Â And I think it's totally reasonable that if you're going to have 1/3 of your brunch menu taken up by various interpretations of eggs benedict, you should know how to make one.Granary has three benedicts, 13, 14 and 19 dollars, respectively, and does not know how to make one. Â Their interpretation of a benedict is hard boiled eggs on toast. Â Really actually not bad tasting, but it's not what I ordered, and if I can make the same thing while hungover and half-asleep, then it ain't $13.I know, it's nitpicky.

The cod was very fresh and delicious. On the other hand, I had just been to Alaska so I have had better cod. The breading is thicker than I usually like. I prefer flakier breading that is similar to the texture of a croissant. Nevertheless, the fried batter had a good crunch to it. Overall, I definitely recommend Granary Tavern if you are looking for some very good fish and chips in Boston. Â The other food looked tasty too. From the outside, the tavern looks like a warehouse but the dÃ©cor is very pretty inside as a sit down restaurant.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

Service is awful - took 20+ min to get our drinks and another 20-30 to get some simple apps. The beer we ordered was totally flat. Sent it back and got charged for it anyway. The food is even worse. I don't know what the new chef is thinking, but everything we loved is gone. Some items like the bang bang cauliflower (which used to be amazing) are still on the menu but taste totally different. Other items are double the price (garlic chips!) and our favorites (pulled pork flatbread, chicken fried chicken!!) are gone. We also got a flatbread which was super bland and way overpriced - would've been better of with a frozen pizza. RIP to the old Granary - we'll miss you dearly.

I made reservations for a party of 5 a few days prior -- there weren't any options online at a reasonable hour, but I was able to snag a prime spot at 7pm when I called. Reservations highly recommended.Food-wise: Their complimentary bread was delightful -- it came out fresh and warm. I ordered the gnocchi with Vermont lobster. The serving size was small (not like the generous portions that you get at Italian restaurants in the North End) with only a few pieces of lobster. What they lacked in quantity, they made up for it in quality. Each bite was just perfect -- somehow both comforting and light. Two of my friends ordered the Macchorenchelli (the most popular selection according to our server) -- which to put it simply is a pasta dish with beef meatballs. This was also delicious.The service was attentive, helpful, and friendly.The real standout about this place is the BEAUTIFUL interior. No wonder Zagat rates this place as ""Best Restaurant Decor."" We were immediately won over by the sky high ceilings, romantic lighting -- the place is modern, sleek, tasteful. A great spot for a special dinner. Pricey. Dress up a little to blend in with the ambience. Now I'm curious about their sister restaurant -- Mistral!Note: If you uber to this address, you'll be led to an apartment/condo.

I've been to several of their restaurants. Each one is a little different. What remains consistent is unparalleled customer service. I could sit here for hours and just watch them do what they do.For my first course this evening, the Polpo ... grilled octopus, squid ink cous cous, cherry peppers, finocchio... The plating was something to behold... It was like a work of art! The Octopus was perfect. I'm also a huge fan of squid ink. This was the first time on cous cous, normally I have It on linguini Pasta.And to my surprise, the Chef sent out the Mafaldine... market exotic mushrooms, truffle butter, Pecorino Toscano. This is probably the most interesting Pasta I've ever had. Long ornamental Pasta... It really holds the sauce beautifully. And like everything thing the do, house made...My main course, the Halibut... East Coast, romanesco cauliflower, lobster mushrooms, uni Crema... Yet another masterpiece... It looks so good, you almost feel guilty eating it... I said almost! The thinly sliced cauliflower was the perfect touch with just the right amount of crunch.Ordinary I would pass on dessert however knowing the caliber of what comes out of the kitchen, I selected the CIOCCOLATO... Warm molten chocolate cake, vanilla bean gelato and my signature Cappuccino...What an amazing evening!

My boyfriend and I booked reservations for my birthday and were seated in a cozy corner at the back of the restaurant.Our waitress was phenomenal and so, so, sweet. The table next to us seemed to be regulars and chatted with the waitress like old friends.I judge Italian restaurants pretty harshly by their complimentary bread and the ciabatta here was just perfect. Super warm, super soft, and super delicious with the butter. We went through a loaf each with no regrets. The White Pearl was a refreshing and fruity cocktail that wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, which I loved.For food we ordered the burrata and a half order of campanelle as appetizers, myself the lobster gnocchi, and my boyfriend the filet. The burrata was very delicious, though at a steep price point of $27. I would trade it out for another half sized pasta if I were to visit again. The pasta dishes were great--the butter sauce on the lobster gnocchi was not too heavy at all and did not leave any buttery film feeling in my mouth. My boyfriend enjoyed his filet, which they charred to perfection with a light smokey taste.What really took me by surprise was the fact that our waitress brought out a small serving of gelato for us with ""happy birthday"" decorating the plate. I was quite surprised that they took the time and effort to do that, especially as all we did was mark down that the meal was for a birthday on Open Table. My boyfriend loved it and openly admitted that he's not that thoughtful and hadn't requested it himself.All in all a really nice meal with great ambiance.

I have come here many times over the years for all different occasions, with friends, with family, on a date. The setting is romantic and the room is beautifully decorated making it feel modern but still warm. It is a high end, expensive restaurant, but well worth it for the quality in my opinion.The service is always exceptional, I've had some of the best waiters here. The menu has a nice selection and I've tried quite a few things on it. The gnocchi is unbelievably out of this world. Everyone I've gone with that has tried it has fallen in love. Â It is so buttery with fresh lobster, absolutely divine. For entrees I loved the scallops and also the halibut, so delicious and fresh. The chicken is very good and the lamb chops are very tender and flavorful, it almost melts in your mouth. The artichokes, truffle fries and whipped potatoes are my favorite sides, they are so tasty! Don't forget dessert, they have a great menu. I've had the crostata and the sugar donuts as well as the warm chocolate molten cake.... just wow! Unbelievable desserts.

God hurled justice down from the skies unto the sinful Boston until it piled up along the road and hardened into ice on the streets. 400 years of deadly winters and technological advancement did little to prepare the town for such a wrath.We ate a couple of things.Lobster and Gnocchi. This was exquisite. I loved how I could scarcely distinguish between the lobster and gnocchi in the low-lighting, so every bite became a surprise. Would a piece of gnocchi cave to the pressure of my jaw, or would lobster perhaps spring back for a chewy descent to nothing?Wagyu beef meat balls. These tasted great and the pasta underneath it was all the way dente.Foie Gras. This was a little disappointing. I realize now that foie gras is best seared on the outsides so that it becomes gooey on the inside. Served cold and in a shape that looked like it came out of a can just makes the mouthfeel less pleasant.Finally I had a dish of veal. This meat was incredibly tender and juicy, and there was something wrapped around it that was seared and gave a good counterpoint to the meat itself. I highly recommend trying it out if you get a chance!One downside to the restaurant is that it seemed a little bit stuffy. I get that it's very formal dress, but in times of need (like this blizzard from hell) did we really deserve a sideways glance from the host from not wearing a suit; not some formal shoes?",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"1771,5,"I came here on a Friday night according to my friend's recommendation. We have Foi Gras and oysters for our appetizers. The Foi Gras comes with fruits on the side. The fruits perfectly neutralize the oily taste. In addition, the raw oysters comes with ingredients. The fishy taste is completely avoided by the sour taste of lemon juice and the bitter taste of the ingredient. As for the main course, I highly recommend the veal. This course is not like normal veal dishes which come with a side. This course uses mashed potato as sauce at the base which completely mixed the soft taste of the veal. I ordered a Japanese whiskey for my dessert. The best thing for it is that they use a perfect rounded ice ball inside the drink so the drink won't get diluted swiftly.This place is worth to be patronized.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"1772,3,"My family of 7 came to Sorellina for my graduation dinner. We read raving reviews and we were excited to try this place. Our server was wonderful, really a nice and accommodating guy. Overall the staff were very friendly. The food was good, but my husband did have an issue with his dish. There were several shell pieces in his dish. We informed the waiter and the manager came over to apologize. We weren't looking for a free meal by any means, but it would have been well respected to ask if he wanted another dish or to reduce the cost of a $50+ dish due to the lazy preparation. We were a little dissatisfied with that which is why I cannot give this place 4/5 stars. I had the salmon and that was tasty but the vegetables were not a good pair for the dinner. My aunt did have the meatballs for an appetizer and they were delicious and she said her steak was as well. So they do have a few very good dishes, but they have to work on improving their vegetable offerings and ultimately how they handle mishaps and lazy chefs in the kitchen. Something should be done to accommodate the guests. Like I said, not looking for anything free but some alteration would have been greatly appreciated and a nice gesture to make up for the mistake. Overall, our waiter was great, manager was just okay, and food is decent but pricy.

When we arrived, the previously agreed upon two-tables-next-to-each-other set up did not work for us, and we wanted to all be at the same table. Sorellina bent over backwards to accommodate us. Before even sitting down they were already impressive. They have Forever Young Malbec by the bottle, one of my favorites, and something hard to find in the Boston area. We started with a few bottles, and made our way into the appetizers. The salmon tartare and tuna tartare were delicious and super fresh. My all time favorite thing was the burrata, which I could have inhaled if I wasn't trying to be professional. We followed up with the meatballs and the gnocchi and both were drool-worthy. Hefty portion of lobster in the gnocchi for you shellfish lovers. For an entree - I had the filet, YUM. Their specialty is the veal Milanese, which my boss got and allowed me to try. Holy moly. As if we needed it, we ordered dessert and I have to tell you, you haven't lived until you've tried the little donuts (bombelina's I think). By then it was time for coffee and Bailey's, and naturally we shut down the restaurant with our happy, full group. From start to finish this was a fantastic experience. I will be keeping Sorellina in mind for all future special events. The service was fantastic, no glass was ever empty, and no plate was left uncleared. 10/10.",Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"1774,5,Excellent service and great food. We came to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was a great night. They complemented us with gelato and wrote happy anniversary. The atmosphere is very nice and romantic.,Sorellina,"1 Huntington Ave Boston, MA 02116"1775,5,"Santouka has really great ramen! It is a small hole in the wall type of place but there's always a line out the door. The line does move pretty quickly and is definitely worth the wait.The ramen is all fresh and I really enjoyed by vegetarian dish. I got a soft boiled egg on the side for a small charge but it was worth it and was perfectly cooked. The regular portion size was plenty for me and the prices were reasonable here, especially for the popular touristy area.All of the waitstaff was attentive and very polite. I am looking forward to coming back here soon and highly recommend it to others!",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1776,5,"Was shopping on Newbury St and came across this GEM. The shop is relatively small, so there may be a bit of a wait outside. The prices range from $12-17 for a bowl. If you order a large, it's only an extra $1 (recommend). Tried the Kara Miso Ramen and I absolutely loved the broth!! The bowl appears small, but they give a decent amount of noodles. Satisfied my ramen cravings!Side note: only two pieces of pork belly came with it",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1777,5,Best ramen in town!!! The broth was amazing especially the miso broth. I love how the egg was half cooked on the inside. Everything was $15. My ramen bowl was small but it will cost more if you want an upgrade. The service was great even tho the wait was super long. TIPS: make reservation! The place can get pretty busyFOOD: 10/10SERVICE: 10/10PRICING: 8/10,Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1778,5,"There's almost always a line outside the store, which is really small on the inside. The ramen is spectacular. They have a $15 combo with a regular size ramen (+1 for large and -1 for small), a side, and an egg. It's perfect if you want to try the ramen and some smaller dishes (and a pretty good deal). The Kara miso ramen was great. You can taste the spiciness, but the soup is definitely not overpowered by oil (I hate ""spicy soups"" that is overly oily). The egg had a soft yolk and was fantastic too. The service is really quick, as is the turnaround. The line goes pretty quickly, and the restaurant is definitely more of an eat-and-go rather than slow type.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1779,5,"Bless this ramen place! I visited in the heart of the winter during a short visit to Boston. Prepare for a line. Somehow on the evening we went, it wasn't as bad according to the others ahead of us who've waited longer in the past - it was about 20-30min for us. No list, just wait your turn in line for a spot to open inside. The space is small so it's not ideal for a group. Definitely a solo or 2-person outing at best. The service is quite speedy once we got in there, bringing out waters and taking our order ASAP. I had the miso ramen, added an egg (they upcharge for that, wish it was standard because soft boiled eggs in ramen are the best). The broth is so rich and flavorful. We don't have many great ramen places in Rochester so it was nice to get a well crafted dish here for comparison. If you're looking for a hearty bowl of ramen, this spot is a winner!",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1780,4,Delicious. Â The best ramen places that I've ever been to was of course in Japan but this come pretty close to it. Â Staffs were friendly and food was great. Â I tried a few ramen orders and they were all delicious. Â If you're in town and have an craving for ramen this is a great place to visit. Â I'm told there is always a line out the door and I did experience that but like all good restaurants there's always wait.,Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1781,5,Had Miso Ramen for lunch while my friends tried the Spicy Miso Ramen ang Shoyu Ramen. The line was a bit long but it's all worth it. The broth of the ramen was superb. The egg and meat was out of this world. The bowl wasn't that big but it's all perfect for your ramen cravings. I would love to eat here again with my friends. Definitely the best ramen in town!,Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1782,5,"Listen, you might be thinking, ""why am I gonna wait in line for maybe 20+ minutes for a bowl of noodle soup?"" And I feel you; it can be cold out there. But this isn't your average noodle soup. This isn't even your grandmother's noodle soup. This is better than that; this soup stares your Nana in the face and says, ""suck it, Nana, I'm better."" Becuase this place is just simple and incredible food, hands down. The Kara Miso ramen is exactly the right kind of spicy to make you feel warm and cozy and ready to take on whatever ailes you. The pork is so damn savory, and the broth is divine. You could swim in this broth; you could eat this broth for days and not get tired or hungry. It's like manna, it's heaven-sent. I can't speak more highly of the food. Certainly what I had. I will say that the service was also top quality and speedy, and the folks are super hospitable, arigato! My only issue was the weird, ambient, smooth jazz music. It's not what I expected. I like jazz, don't get me wrong. Some Coltrane or Miles Davis and I'm set. But the elevator vibes were bizarre. Verdict: you should've eaten here months ago. This is the restaurant you've been dreaming about. Do yourself a favor.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1783,5,I came here and it was SO good. I'll be honest- I amno ramen expert but the broth was flavorful and the meat was tender and I was full and happy why I was done. The meal was also cheap and the service was quickBe warned: this place is VERY small and there is almost always a wait especially at peak times,Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1784,4,"Tiny eat-in spot for delish ramen!I have walked by this place time and time again, seeing people standing outside waiting for some hot broth, a slice of pork, and noodles that promise a happy belly. My husband and I finally made it here for an early dinner on a Saturday night. We only waited about 15 minutes outside for a seat at community table. Santouka offers a few different ramen options and a few appetizers. I went for the shoyu ramen and was so happy they have the option of a small! I can never finish a regular size bowl so this was perfect.A few moments later we received our hot bowls of ramen goodness. My broth was rich and flavorful and the noodles were good (although, not the best I've had). The small was a perfect portion for me--I didn't feel I was stuffing myself to finish the dish.The staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean and tidy. Overall, a good experience for a quick dine in ramen restaurant in Boston.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1785,5,"Absolutely a hit! I'm a bit of an adventure junkie and as such, I love to pick a random city and explore it without to much planning. One of the benefits of doing this is that I get to try new things and unique foods or foods unique to said city (ie.. Boston cream pie) Naturally, this adventure was no different. My visit to Boston has given me life. I've walked the freedon trails and stood on the oldest commissioned Naval ship in the United States. The USS Constitution. Now, after a full day of touring, I decided to turn to Yelp to help me pick a great place to eat. I decided on a proper ramen noodles experience. The resturant is a small space but filled with amazing eye popping bowls of noodles. The staff kept to the crowd happy by taking and filling orders swiftly. I don't think I've ever been served so fast in all my life. So if your ever in Boston and you want what I like to call a proper ramen experience, I highly recommend this ramen gem.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1786,5,"Came here because I didn't want to ride the traffic to Harvard squareOverall, I enjoyed the service and the ramenRamen is well made, broth tastes great; and I love being able to see the cooks putting their heart and passion into making the food, it makes the food tastes much better for some reasonThe service was very friendlyMy only gripe was waiting in line, but I guess that adds to anticipation lol so it's all gucci",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1787,2,"So, I've had so many different experiences with Santouka. I've had it first as a pop up event at Itadaki in 2014. My boyfriend and I waited almost an hour for it and it was well worth it. It was one of our favorites and after having had tried it, we wished there was an actual one in Boston. A few years later (maybe a year or 2) they finally had their first location in Harvard Square.Excited, we come to the restaurant and it was packed. When we finally sat, we got the Char Siu, the best sounding option on the menu and the one that sounded the most reminiscent of what we had a few years ago at the pop up. To our dismay, it was way saltier than we remembered. The portion was pretty small compared to other bowls in Boston, and it was more expensive. I thought I was the only one who thought this, but my boyfriend said that that was his experience as well.So this brings me to the Back Bay location. Last month, me and my friend came here on one of the coldest days in Boston. As expected the line was out the door, for this location is significantly smaller than the Harvard Square location. Out of our minds, we decided to wait. We were sat in about 15 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. One thing that I did appreciate this time was that they were having a Hungry Student Offer. If you showed your student ID to the server, you would get a large ramen for the size of a small. So that was a nice surprise.I got the Char Siu ramen again. Also I couldn't believe that you had to pay for egg. I hate paying for adding an egg to ramen. It feels like buying water. Absolutely ridiculous. Think about it. Having it again confirmed my feelings. It was still pretty salty and the noodles weren't my favorite. I don't think I would give this place another chance.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1788,5,"I came in midday on a Friday and the line was fairly short, we were able to get in within 45 minutes. The downside to the wait is that you can't put your name down and browse the shops along Newbury street while you wait for your table, you literally have to be in line the entire time. I think if I had to wait for any longer than 45 minutes, I wouldn't come back.Waiting times aside, the ramen was excellent! I ordered the vegetarian option and was surprised at how flavorful the broth and toppings were. It was traditional ramen done right. I have tried other spots in Boston and this one was definitely the top. If it wasn't for the wait, I would definitely come back.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1789,4,"Santouka was as a pleasant surprise -- the service was quick, friendly, and efficient, and the ramen was a great bowl with incredible soup, noodles, and toppings.As stated in other reviews, the restaurant is small with very few seats. I always see a long time formed outside but I didn't have to wait too long on a cold Friday afternoon (just five minutes.) The soup isn't too sodium-heavy so I didn't feel very thirsty afterwards. I can't wIt to be back for another bowl of casual ramen.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1790,5,"Arguably one of the best ramen places in Boston. There are two locations (Cambridge and Back Bay). You'll find long lines at both locations. I usually frequent the Back Bay as it is the more convenient of the two for me.Any of the ramens are good. I usually get the spicy one. I also make the ramen a combination lunch, which adds a bowl of rice (with a topping) and an egg. The food is prepared and gets to you pretty quickly.The seating is tight so make sure you make nice with your neighbor!",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1791,5,"This place is probably the best ramen spot in all of Boston. Make sure to come at the right time (before noon in my experience) otherwise you can expect to wait a looong time to be seated. They only have about 15 seats total inside, it's not a very big space. I recommend getting the combo, it's totally worth it. You get a lot of food (especially if you go for a large ramen bowl, only $1 extra). I love the Cha-siu gohan side that comes with it. All in all a great spot for food despite the potentially long wait time",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1792,4,"After 30 mins of waiting in line, (thankfully it was a warm day!), we got inside and sat at the counter. The service is quick and the portions are filling! Love the pork belly and miso broth. I'm not a ramen expert by any means, but I can say this was a great meal! One recommendation that I'm sure they've heard before is: why not offer take out? There's always a line outside because of how small the area is, but they could generate so much revenue with all the colleges and residents nearby!",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1793,4,"When I first walked by this ramen spot and saw a line outside, I automatically thought in my head ""No. I am not waiting in the Boston cold in November for ramen."" But then I found out it's the same chain as the ramen place I frequent at Mitsuwa in Edgewater, NJ and was also craving ramen, so I thought, ok I'll give it a try.Through reviews and tips on Yelp, I knew that this place was small. Â When you go, you don't even go to the counter to let them know how many are in your party. You just wait in line. They won't seat you until your entire party is there, so if there's a single seat available and there's someone at the end of the line eating by himself, he gets bumped to sit inside. Â I waited about half an hour, but I also let two people go in front of me since my party was incomplete. If they were there with me when I got into line, it would have only been a 20 minute wait. Once we got in, the waiter was pretty prompt in giving us the menu. It took awhile in my opinion to give our order, but afterwards, we got our ramen pretty fast. Â I ordered the Tonkotsu cha shu ramen with a shio broth. Â The pork was very tender and the noodles were on point. I've always loved the ramen in Mitsuwa, so I knew it was going to be good. One thing that was new was that in the ramen was umeboshi (pickled plum). Â It was an excellent surprise that I enjoyed when I got to the bottom of the bowl. Santouka is also one of the few places where I actually drink the broth.I would definitely come back, but the waiting is annoying.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"1794,4,"We were walking around Newbury street when my boyfriend and I saw a line forming outside this restaurant, so we decided to wait and see what's it's all about. We waited for about 30 minutes, so it wasn't too bad. This place holds about 20 people so the turnover is pretty high. This is how ramen shops in Boston operates, so eat and then leave quickly so others will get a chance to get through the doors! Location is prime. Super close to coffee shops, shopping area, and the vibe of the area is just super hip. Expect this area to be busy with cars and people on the weekends. Service: They were attentive and quick. I mean, it sorta makes sense in a high turnover place like this. Â No complaints here. Decor: minimalistic and functional. One unisex restroom that was very clean. Their floor was also surprisingly very clean, considering how busy they are. You don't really get to choose where you seat, but there are both a bar and tables to eat your ramen. You get to see them cook it through the glass window too. Food: I got a regular goma miso ramen and for highly recommend that! So yummy. My boyfriend got a large namban ramen. We both agreed that my broth was more flavorful, whereas the namban soup base is more subtle. Overall, this is a pretty solid ramen spot if you're in the area.",Santouka Back Bay,"66 Hereford St Boston, MA 02115"
